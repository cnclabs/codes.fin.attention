the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented account for the shanghai operation as a discontinued operation under generally accepted accounting principles gaap as a result of our decision to sell the business  which we announced in july our consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows have been reformatted for all years presented to separate the results of the discontinued operation from the results of our continuing operations 
this presentation is required by gaap and facilitates historical and future trend analysis of our continuing operations 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  all fiscal and prior periods presented have been restated to reflect results of the shanghai operation as a discontinued operation 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to our continuing operations 
overview we design  manufacture and market fiber optic subsystems  integrated modules and components that expand optical bandwidth  amplify optical signals  monitor and protect wavelength performance and redirect light signals within an optical network 
our product portfolio includes solutions for next generation  all optical dense wavelength division multiplexing  or dwdm  optical amplification  switching and routing  and monitoring and conditioning applications 
we also offer our customers expert optical manufacturing services oms for the production and packaging of highly integrated optical subsystems and turnkey solutions based upon a customer s specific product design and specification 
our broad line of products and services increases the performance of optical networks and enables optical system manufacturers to provide flexible and scalable bandwidth to support the increase of data traffic on the internet and other public and private networks 
we market our products and services to telecommunications equipment manufacturers worldwide 
we generate substantially all of our revenues from the sale of fiber optic subsystems  integrated modules and components 
to date  we have developed over standard products that are sold or integrated into customized solutions for our customers 
our products are generally categorized into the following major groups our bandwidth creation products  which include wavelength expansion and optical amplification products  and our bandwidth management products  which include wavelength performance monitoring and protection  and optical switching products 
a majority of our revenues are derived from our bandwidth creation products  which include our wavelength expansion products  in particular  multiplexers 
the fiber optics industry has been in a significant period of consolidation following a dramatic slowdown in capital spending since late by carriers faced with substantial excess bandwidth capacity and high levels of 
table of contents corporate debt 
beginning in late  as the industry entered its downturn and consolidation phase  various customers canceled existing orders 
we incurred substantial costs associated with excess and obsolete inventory  workforce reduction  canceled orders  excess fixed assets  excess facilities and other charges 
during the fiscal year ended june   we reduced our headcount by people  or  completed the move of our manufacturing operations to china  transitioned our research and development to china and further reduced our cost structure to respond to the significantly lower revenues than previously anticipated by the company 
in addition  in july  we announced the planned future sale of our shanghai facility and reflect the results of our shanghai operation as a discontinued operation 
we expect to continue to implement programs to improve manufacturing yields and reduce costs though the magnitude of the expected benefits will be smaller than those realized in the prior two fiscal years 
there is no certainty that these programs will be successful 
our visibility continues to be limited with respect to telecommunications equipment providers 
we will continue to evaluate our business on an ongoing basis in light of current and future revenue trends and adjust our cost structure accordingly 
during the fiscal year ended june   we reduced our headcount by  people  or  initiated the move of our manufacturing operations to china and further reduced our cost structure to respond to the significantly lower revenues than previously anticipated by the company 
cost of revenues 
our cost of revenues consists of raw material  salaries and related personnel expense  manufacturing overhead  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and warranties 
we expect cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  to fluctuate from period to period 
our gross margins will primarily be affected by manufacturing volume  our pricing policies  production yield  costs incurred in improving manufacturing processes  mix of products sold  provisions for excess and obsolete inventories and mix of products manufactured in china or the united states 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  depreciation  non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs  patent filing costs and fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  all of which relate to the design  development  testing  pre manufacturing and significant improvement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
sales and marketing expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for marketing  sales  customer service and application engineering support personnel  commissions paid to internal and external sales representatives  as well as costs associated with trade shows and other marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  accounting  and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
non cash compensation expense 
prior to and after our initial public offering  we granted stock options and issued warrants to employees and consultants at prices below the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant or issuance 
during the period from july  through june   we recorded aggregate deferred stock compensation  net of cancellations  of approximately million of which million  million and million was expensed during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
while this expense has increased our net loss  it has had no impact on our cash flows 
with respect to employee stock based compensation  we are amortizing the deferred compensation expense over the vesting period  as set forth in the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 or fin under the fin method  each vested tranche of options is accounted for as a separate option grant awarded for services 
the compensation expenses are recognized over the period during which the services are 
table of contents provided 
accordingly  this method results in higher compensation expenses being recognized in the earlier vesting periods of an option 
non employee grants are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and emerging issues task force  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf and valued using the black scholes model 
the deferred compensation expense related to non employees stock option grants are also amortized over the vesting period as set forth in fin the remaining balance at june  of million will be expensed over future remaining vesting periods 
we estimate that our future stock compensation expense from options and shares granted or issued from july through june  will be million    and  for the years ending june    and  assuming no cancellations or additional stock option grants with exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock 
in october  we sold  shares of common stock in an underwritten initial public offering  including  shares of common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s over allotment option  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  before offering expenses of approximately million 
simultaneously with the closing of the public offering   shares of convertible preferred stock were converted to shares of common stock on a one for one basis 
in addition  the note payable to cisco systems and the related interest expense was converted into  shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  or of the public offering price of per share 
the discount feature of this convertible note payable resulted in a charge of million  recorded as sales and marketing expense in the quarter ended december  acquisition of aurora 
in june  we acquired aurora associates and aurora photonics  inc aurora in a transaction accounted for as a purchase business combination 
aurora is a developer of acoustic optic ao devices and systems 
these advanced ao devices and systems are classified as spatial ao deflectors and bragg cells  temporal ao modulators and frequency shifters and spectral ao tunable filter modulations 
the purchase price comprised million cash   shares of common stock valued at   of transaction costs and  in assumed liabilities 
the total purchase price aggregated million and was allocated to tangible assets acquired of  identifiable intangible assets acquired of  goodwill of  and in process research and development of  use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  accounts receivable  inventories  intangible assets  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  and our procedures relating to these policies  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and product returns we recognize revenue using the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
under these guidelines  revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment of the product or customer acceptance  which ever is later  provided that persuasive 
table of contents evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue associated with contract related cancellation payments from customers is recognized when a formal agreement is signed or a purchase order is issued by the customer covering such payments and the collectibility of the cancellation payments is determined to be reasonably assured 
in addition  we estimate future product returns based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenue by these estimated future returns 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  future estimates could be revised accordingly 
warranty obligations we provide reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical experience of known product failure rates and expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
additionally  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be made if unforeseen technical problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors differ from estimates  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves 
alternatively  if our estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
risk evaluation financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable 
substantially all of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are managed or held by three financial institutions 
such deposits are in excess of the amount of the insurance provided by the federal government on such deposits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses on such deposits 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable are derived from revenue earned from customers located in the united states  europe  asia and canada 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and currently require no collateral from our customers 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses is maintained in anticipation of the inability or unwillingness of customers to make required payments 
when we become aware that a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations  such as the result of bankruptcy or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position  we record a specific allowance to reflect the level of credit risk in the customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial condition of customers  and if the condition or circumstances of our customers deteriorates  estimates of the recoverability of trade receivables could be materially affected and we may be required to record additional allowances 
alternatively  if our estimates are determined to be greater than the actual amounts necessary  we may reverse a portion of such allowance in future periods based on actual collection experience 
excess and obsolete inventory we regularly assess the valuation of inventories and write down those inventories which are obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon our analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecast or actual demand from customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  we may sell inventories that had previously been written down as was the case in the years ended june  and in recent periods we have recorded significant charges related to excess and obsolete inventory 
see restructuring costs and other charges below 
property  plant and equipment we evaluate the carrying value of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  
table of contents but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of property  plant and equipment  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would write down such assets based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
in the years ended june   and  we had no such write down 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of property  plant and equipment  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
in recent periods we have recorded significant charges related to excess property and equipment and facilities 
see restructuring costs and other charges below 
goodwill and other identifiable intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on july  we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill in fiscal and an annual impairment review in fiscal we did not record any impairment charge due to the adoption of sfas no 
or our annual impairment review 
in addition to the annual impairment review  we assess the impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 when we determined that the carrying value of goodwill and other identified intangibles was not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measured any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we recorded a charge of  during the fiscal year ended june  related to the abandonment of one of our technologies 
additionally  a million charge was recorded based upon an impairment analysis of the carrying amount of the goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to the telelight acquisition during the fiscal year ended june  results of operations for each of the years ended june   and revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was substantially due to decreased shipments of all our products including our wavelength expansion products  optical amplification products and optical switching products to our customers 
the decreases in shipments were primarily due to the continued slowdown in telecommunications equipment spending 
additionally  in fiscal there was a minor impact due to decreases in average selling prices of our products over the prior year 
though further declines in average selling prices are anticipated through the fiscal year ending june   shipment volume is expected to increase to offset the decrease in average selling prices 
included in revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  is  and million  respectively  for contract cancellation fees 
we estimate revenue in the first quarter of fiscal to be million to million and though visibility remains difficult we also anticipate a sequential increase in revenue in the second quarter of fiscal compared to the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents revenues decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  this decrease was substantially due to decreased shipments of all our products including our wavelength expansion products  optical amplification products and optical switching products to our customers 
the decreases in shipments were primarily due to the slowdown in telecommunications equipment spending 
additionally  in fiscal there was a minor impact due to decreases in average selling prices of our products over the prior year 
included in revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  is million and million  respectively  for contract cancellation fees from certain customers 
gross profit loss 
gross profit increased million  or  to a gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended june  from a gross loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  this resulted in an increase in gross margin from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  our gross margin for the fiscal year ended june  was positively impacted by a non cash compensation recovery of  and the unexpected sale of inventory that had been previously fully reserved of million 
our gross margin for the fiscal year ended june   was negatively impacted by the million excess inventory charge and  non cash compensation expense  partially offset by the million in revenues for cancellation fees from significant customers and the unexpected sale of inventory that had been previously fully reserved of  in addition  our gross margin increased due to the cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reduction and the consolidation of excess facilities and the cost benefits of operating in china offset by higher manufacturing costs relative to our production volume  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the transfer of our manufacturing capacity to china and lower yields in our manufacturing facilities in china due to the rapid manufacturing transfer 
the excess inventory charge in the fiscal year ended june  reflects the significant downturn in customer demand 
in response to this downturn  we focused on completing the transition of substantially all of our manufacturing to china 
we are continuing to implement programs to further improve production yields of our products 
we cannot assure you  however  that these programs will be successful in increasing our gross margin 
we anticipate that we will see a slight sequential improvement in gross margin in the first quarter of fiscal from the fourth quarter of fiscal and further anticipate we will achieve a slight sequential improvement in our gross margin in the second quarter of fiscal compared to the first quarter of fiscal however  this is dependent on the anticipated increases in revenues  achieving improvements in our production yields and meeting our cost management initiatives 
gross profit decreased million  or  to a gross loss of million for the fiscal year ended june  from a gross profit of million for the fiscal year ended june  this resulted in a decrease in gross margin from for the fiscal year ended june  to for the fiscal year ended june  our gross margin for the fiscal year ended june   was negatively impacted by the million excess inventory charge and  non cash compensation expense  partially offset by the million in revenues for cancellation fees from significant customers and the unexpected sale of inventory that had been previously fully reserved of  our gross margin for the fiscal year ended june   was negatively impacted by the million excess inventory charge and million non cash compensation expense partially offset by the million in revenues for cancellation fees from significant customers 
the excess inventory charges reflect the significant downturn in customer demand 
in response to this downturn  we focused on the transition of substantially all of our manufacturing to china 
our gross margin also decreased due to higher manufacturing costs relative to our production volume  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the transfer of our manufacturing capacity to china and lower yields in our manufacturing facilities in china due to the rapid manufacturing transfer partially offset by cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reduction and the consolidation of excess facilities and the cost benefits of operating in china 
research and development 
research and development expenses  including non cash compensation expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in research and development expenses was primarily due to cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reductions  lower costs as a result of 
table of contents transitioning research and development to china  lower non cash compensation expense  lower depreciation and facility costs due to restructurings and lower project material costs 
research and development expenses  including non cash compensation expense  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reductions and lower non cash compensation expense 
we believe that developing customer solutions at the prototype stage is critical to our strategic product development objectives 
we further believe that  in order to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we will need to fund investments in several concurrent product development projects 
we expect our quarterly research and development expenses in each of the first two quarters of fiscal to remain approximately equal to research and development expenses in the fourth quarter of fiscal sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses  including non cash compensation recovery  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to lower personnel related costs and lower commissions earned by our internal and external sales representatives associated with decreased revenues 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in non cash compensation expense 
sales and marketing expenses  including the cisco systems million conversion charge and non cash compensation recovery  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the prior fiscal year was primarily due to the cisco systems million conversion charge in the fiscal year ended june  and no such charge in the fiscal year ended june   lower non cash compensation expense  lower commissions paid to our internal and external sales representatives associated with decreased revenues and a decrease in tradeshow costs  advertising and other customer related costs 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in sales and marketing personnel and personnel related costs and occupancy costs 
we expect our quarterly sales and marketing expenses to increase slightly on a sequential basis from the fourth quarter of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal as a result of anticipated increasing product shipments 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation expense  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower non cash compensation expense and cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reduction 
general and administrative expenses  including non cash compensation expense  decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to lower non cash compensation expense  a reduction in our legal fees and cost savings associated with the worldwide workforce reduction 
we anticipate our quarterly general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in the first quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal and then to decrease in the second quarter of fiscal to the approximate level of the fourth quarter of fiscal general and administrative expenses 
non cash compensation expense 
from july  through june   we had recorded an aggregate of million in deferred non cash compensation  net of cancellations 
non cash compensation expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in deferred non cash compensation was primarily due to the method under which the deferred non cash compensation was amortized  as set out in fasb interpretation no 
 and stock option cancellations 
non cash compensation expense decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  
table of contents restructuring costs and other charges

our revenues have been generally decreasing in sequential quarters from million in the fiscal quarter ended december  to million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million  million and ending with million in the fiscal quarter ended june  due to this decline in business conditions  we continued to restructure our business and realigned resources to focus on monitoring costs  preserving cash  completing the planned move of manufacturing operations and research and development to china and focused on core opportunities 
restructuring costs and other charges incurred during the year ended june for the year ended june   million of restructuring costs and other charges were recorded as operating expenses for worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of excess property and equipment and facilities and other charges 
the following paragraphs provide detailed information relating to the restructuring costs and other charges for the year ended june  
table of contents worldwide workforce reduction during the year ended june   we recorded a charge of approximately million primarily related to severance and fringe benefits associated with the planned reduction of approximately employees and voluntary termination of our former chief executive officer 
of the million charge  approximately  was severance and fringe benefits associated with the resignation of our former chief executive officer 
of the planned reduction of approximately employees  approximately employees were engaged in manufacturing activities and approximately employees and employees were from sites located in san jose  california and china  respectively 
as of june   the planned worldwide workforce reductions have been substantially completed 
excess property and equipment  facilities and other charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to excess property and equipment during the year ended june  property and equipment disposed of or removed from operations of million were related to the manufacture of fiber optic subsystems  integrated modules and components 
the excess property and equipment charge represented the charge required to re measure such assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the carrying amount of property and equipment to be disposed of was million as of june   and has been included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  property and equipment removed from operations of million consisted primarily of leasehold improvements associated with the consolidation of excess facilities 
in addition  we incurred a charge of million for leases  primarily related to excess or closed facilities with planned exit dates 
we estimated the cost of the facility leases based on the contractual terms of the agreements and then current real estate market conditions 
we determined that it would take approximately two years to sublease the various properties that will be vacated  and then subleased at lower values than we are contractually obligated to pay 
amounts related to the lease expense net of anticipated sublease proceeds as well as projected costs to terminate the lease will be paid over the respective lease terms through the consolidation of excess facilities includes the closure of certain manufacturing facilities located in san jose  california and zhuhai  china 
the total number of sites closed under the restructuring plan is three 
we also recorded a benefit to restructuring costs and charges of  relating primarily to change of estimated amounts due to suppliers and vendors to terminate agreements for the purchase of capital equipment and inventory 
impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets due to the decline in current business conditions  we abandoned one of our technologies 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  during the fiscal year ended june  restructuring costs and other charges incurred during the years ended june  and for the years ended june  and  million and million  respectively  of restructuring costs and other charges were recorded as operating expenses 
in addition  a million and million excess and obsolete inventory charge was recorded to cost of sales for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the following paragraphs provide detailed information relating to the restructuring costs and other charges and excess and obsolete inventory charge during the years ended june  and worldwide workforce reduction the worldwide workforce reductions in connection with our initial plans of restructuring started in the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fiscal years ended june  and  we recorded a charge of approximately million and  respectively  primarily related to severance and fringe benefits associated with the planned reduction of approximately  employees 
of the planned reduction of approximately  employees  approximately  were engaged in manufacturing activities and 
table of contents approximately and  were from sites located in san jose  california and china  respectively 
as of june   the planned worldwide workforce reductions in connection with our initial plans have been completed 
excess property and equipment  facilities and other charges we recorded a restructuring charge of million relating to excess property and equipment during the fiscal year ended june  property and equipment disposed of or removed from operations were related to the manufacture of fiber optic subsystems  integrated modules and components 
the excess property and equipment charge represented the charge required to re measure such assets at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
while the remaining assets removed from operations as of june  are being actively marketed  we expect the period of disposal to be an additional nine months for most of the assets 
the property and equipment disposed of or removed from operations consisted primarily of production and engineering equipment  but also included leasehold improvements  computer equipment  office equipment and furniture and fixtures 
in addition  during the fiscal years ended june  and  we incurred a charge of million and million  respectively  for leases primarily related to excess or closed facilities with planned exit dates 
we estimated the cost of the facility leases based on the contractual terms of the agreements and then current real estate market conditions 
we determined that it would take approximately two years to sublease the various properties that will be vacated  and then subleased at lower values than we are contractually obligated to pay 
amounts related to the lease expense net of anticipated sublease proceeds will be paid over the respective lease terms through the consolidation of excess facilities includes the closure of certain manufacturing and research and development facilities located in san jose  california and beijing  chengdu and fuzhou  china 
the total number of sites closed under the restructuring plan is six 
we also recorded other restructuring costs and charges of million and million relating primarily to payments due to suppliers and vendors to terminate agreements for the purchase of capital equipment and inventory for the years ended june  and  respectively 
provision for excess and obsolete inventory we recorded provisions for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million and million  which was charged to cost of sales during the fiscal years ended june  and june   respectively 
these excess inventory charges were due to sudden and material declines in backlog and forecasted revenue 
there were no inventory provision charges during the year ended june  we evaluate the need to provide write downs for excess and obsolete inventory on an individual part analysis based on estimated future sales of our products compared to quantities on hand at each balance sheet date 
this analysis is based on specific sales forecasts for each of our products 
information that we would consider in determining the forecast would include contractual obligations to deliver products  purchase orders with delivery dates or management s knowledge of a specific order that would significantly alter the sales forecast 
return of property and equipment as of june   we had million of accounts payable associated with the purchase of certain capital equipment from a vendor 
in connection with an evaluation of our manufacturing capacity needs  it was determined that this new capital equipment was excess based on current anticipated production levels 
during the fiscal year ended june   we negotiated a settlement with the vendor whereby the vendor accepted the return of equipment over several quarters totaling million for a settlement fee of  accordingly  the change in accounts payable and property and equipment is reflected as a non cash item in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets for the year ended june   a million charge was recorded based upon an impairment analysis of the carrying amount of the goodwill and purchased intangible assets related to our acquisition of telelight  which we completed in april merger fees 
in connection with the proposed merger between oplink and avanex corporation  which was not approved on august  at the special meeting of our stockholders  we incurred million and million in merger fees for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
in process research and development ip r d 
in connection with the acquisition of aurora in june  we recorded a  charge for ip r d in the fourth quarter of fiscal for products that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
these products included an ao variable optical attenuator which will regulate optical signals  a fiber optic bypass switch which will act as a temporary switch and can be used in conjunction with existing mechanical switches  a piao tunable filter which will be the first electronically chargeable filter  a portable optical spectrum analyzer which will view various wavelengths and indicate events on a real time basis  a dynamic fiber amplifier equalizer which will balance the signals inside the fiber before transmission to the amplifier  and a reconfigurable optical add drop multiplexer which will allow the user to electronically change ports  wavelengths and fiber on demand 
the value of the ip r d products was determined by estimating the net cash flows from the sale of the products resulting from the completion of this project  reduced by the portion of the net cash flows from the revenue attributable to core technology 
the resulting cash flows were then discounted back to their present value using a discount rate of 
at the time of the acquisition  the six products ranged from approximately to complete 
the fair value assigned to the in process research and development totaled  and was charged to expense at the time of the acquisition 
amortization of goodwill  intangible and other assets 
amortization of goodwill  intangible and other assets of approximately   and million for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively  represents charges incurred as a result of our acquisition of aurora in june and telelight in april we ceased to amortize goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  interest and other income  net decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower yields on our cash investments  overall decreased cash balances from the use of cash in the fiscal year s loss from operations  investing outlays for capital purchases and financing outlays relating to repurchase of common stock  repayment of line of credit borrowings and repayment of capital lease obligations 
gain loss on sale of assets 
gain on sale of assets decreased million to a loss of  for the fiscal year ended june  from a gain of million for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily due to the sale of excess fixed assets less than the carrying amount of assets held for sale 
gain on sale of assets increased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  from a loss of  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to the sale of excess fixed assets greater than the carrying amount of assets held for sale 
provision for income taxes 
at june  we had approximately million of federal and million of state net operating loss carryforwards 
because of certain changes in ownership of the company in and  there is an annual limitation of approximately  on the use of the net 
table of contents operating loss carryforwards pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we have recorded a gross deferred tax asset of million as of june   against which a valuation allowance is recorded that reduces the gross deferred tax asset to zero  an amount that management believes will more likely than not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management recorded a valuation allowance to the extent we do not have a carryback right 
based on our history of losses and uncertainty of generating future taxable income  the realizable portion of the deferred tax assets is equal only to the amount of income tax expense expected to be paid during fiscal  which is zero  and represents the amount that we believe will more likely than not be realizable based on current available objective evidence 
discontinued operation 
during fiscal  we reported a loss from discontinued operation of million related to the planned future sale of our shanghai operation  which we will continue to operate until it is sold 
this loss consists of an operating loss of million incurred by the shanghai operation during fiscal  plus a million charge representing the write down of the net assets of the shanghai operation to their estimated net realizable value  less estimated costs to sell 
loss from the shanghai operation in fiscal and fiscal was million and  respectively 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for the last eight quarters 
the information for each of these quarters is unaudited but has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements 
the quarterly results have been adjusted to reflect the shanghai operation as a discontinued operation 
in the opinion of management  all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes

the factors  many of which are more fully discussed in other risk factors  that are likely to cause these variations include  among others economic downturn and uncertainty of the fiber optic industry  economic conditions specific to the communications and related industries and the development and size of the markets for our products  fluctuations in demand for  and sales of  our products

due to the factors noted above and other factors noted under the caption entitled risk factors under item  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results will not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance

during fiscal  we expect to use approximately million for capital expenditures worldwide 
we expect to use cash generated from our initial public offering for these expenditures

on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
on september   our board of directors approved an increase in our buyback plan to repurchase up to an aggregate of million of our common stock 
such repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices  in negotiated transactions off the market or pursuant to a b plan adopted by the company

as of june   repurchases of million have been made under the repurchase program 
our principal source of liquidity at june  consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
our capital expenditures totaled  in fiscal we may use cash and cash equivalents from time to time to fund our acquisition of businesses and technologies 
we may be required to raise funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our ability to pursue our business strategy and achieve and maintain profitability

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates interest rate exposure the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of june   all of our investments were in money market funds  certificates of deposits  municipal bonds or high quality commercial paper with maturities of less than six month from the balance sheet date 
declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
the following table summarizes our current investment securities in thousands  except percentages carrying value at june  average rate of return at june  carrying value at june  average rate of return at june  annualized annualized investment securities cash equivalents variable rate cash equivalents fixed rate short term investments variable rate short term investments fixed rate total foreign currency exchange rate exposure we operate in the united states  manufacture in china  and the substantial majority of our sales to date have been made in us dollars 
certain expenses from our china operations are incurred in the chinese renminbi 
we expect that gains and losses from fluctuations in the currency exchange rate related to sales which are made in chinese renminbi are likely to be substantially offset from fluctuations in the currency exchange rate related to intercompany payments from our subsidiaries in china to our parent corporation which are made in us dollars 
accordingly  we believe that we currently have no material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we expect our international revenues and expenses to be denominated largely in us dollars 
we believe that our china operations will likely expand in the future and account for a larger portion of our worldwide manufacturing and revenue 
as a result  we anticipate that we may experience increased exposure to the risks of fluctuating currencies and may choose to engage in currency hedging activities to reduce these risks 
however  we cannot be certain that any such hedging activities will be effective  or available to us at commercially reasonable rates
