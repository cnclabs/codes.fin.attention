general wholesale sales 
among the more significant factors that influence annual sales are general economic conditions in the company s domestic and international markets  new product introductions  the level and effectiveness of advertising and marketing expenditures and product pricing decisions 
approximately of the company s total sales are from international markets and therefore reported sales are affected by foreign exchange rates 
significant portions of the company s international sales are billed in swiss francs and translated to us dollars at average exchange rates for financial reporting purposes 
the company s business is seasonal 
there are two major selling seasons in the company s domestic markets the spring season  which includes school graduations and several holidays and  most importantly  the christmas and holiday season 
major selling seasons in certain international markets center on significant local holidays that occur in late winter or early spring 
these markets are a less significant portion of the company s business and  therefore  their impact is far less than that of the selling seasons in north america 
retail sales 
the company s retail operations consist of movado boutiques and outlet stores located throughout the us the company does not have any overseas retail operations 
the significant factors that influence annual sales volumes in the company s retail operations are similar to those that influence domestic wholesale operations 
in addition  many of the company s outlet stores are located near vacation destinations and  therefore  the seasonality of these stores is driven by the peak tourist season associated with these locations 
gross margins 
the company s overall gross margins are primarily affected by four major factors brand and product sales mix  product pricing strategy  manufacturing costs and the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
gross margins vary among the brands included in the company s portfolio and also among watch models within each brand 
luxury and premium retail price point models generally earn lower gross margins than more popular moderate price models 
gross margins in the company s outlet business are lower than those of the wholesale business since the outlets primarily sell seconds and discontinued models that generally command lower selling prices 
gross margins from the sale of watches in the movado boutiques exceed those of the wholesale business since the company earns full channel margins from manufacture to point of sale to the consumer 
all of the company s brands compete with a number of other brands on the basis of not only styling but also wholesale and retail price 
the company s ability to improve margins through price increases is therefore  to some extent  constrained by competitors actions 
manufacturing costs of the company s brands consist primarily of component costs  internal and subcontractor assembly costs and unit overhead costs associated with the company s supply chain operations in switzerland and asia 
the company seeks to control and reduce component and subcontractor labor costs through a combination of negotiations with existing suppliers and alternative sourcing 
the company s supply chain operations consist of logistics management of assembly operations and product sourcing in switzerland and asia and minor assembly in switzerland 
through aggressive productivity improvement efforts  the company has controlled the level of overhead costs and maintained flexibility in its cost structure by outsourcing a significant portion of its component and assembly requirements and expects to extend this strategy over the near term 
since a substantial amount of the company s product costs are incurred in swiss francs  fluctuations in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate can impact the company s production costs and  therefore  its gross margins 
the company hedges its swiss franc purchases using a combination of forward contracts  purchased currency options and spot purchases 
the company s hedging program has  in the recent past  been reasonably successful in stabilizing product costs and gross margins despite exchange rate fluctuations 
operating expenses 
the company s operating expenses consist primarily of advertising  selling  distribution and general and administrative expenses 
annual advertising expenditures are based principally on overall strategic considerations relative to maintaining or increasing market share in markets that management considers to be crucial to the company s continued success as well as on general economic conditions in the various markets around the world in which the company sells its products 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  sales commissions  sales force travel and entertainment  expenses associated with the basel watch and jewelry fair and other industry trade shows and operating costs incurred in connection with the company s retail business 
sales commissions vary with overall sales levels 
retail operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and store rents 
distribution expenses consist primarily of salaries of distribution staff  rental and other occupancy costs  security  depreciation and amortization of furniture and leasehold improvements and shipping supplies 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other employee compensation  employee benefit plan costs  office rent  management information systems costs  bad debts  patent and trademark expenses and various other general corporate expenses 
operating expenses over the last three years reflects the net effect of the company s efforts to reduce spending  implement productivity improvements  and at the same time  invest in strategic growth initiatives  including the movado boutique expansion and the launch of the tommy hilfiger watch line 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and those significant policies are more fully described in note to mgi s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements and the application of the most critical of those policies require management to make judgments based on estimates and assumptions that affect the information reported 
on an on going basis  management reevaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to sales discounts and markdowns  product returns  bad debt  inventories  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligation  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources on historical experience  contractual commitments and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes its revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  or in the case of retail sales  at the time of register receipt 
the company estimates returns and sales and cash discount allowances in the same period the revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis  customer agreements and or currently known factors that arise in the normal course of business 
while such returns and allowances have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  future actual experience may differ from that experienced in the past 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may be uncollectible in the future 
estimates are used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on the company s on going credit evaluations of the customers and customer payment history and account aging 
while the actual bad debt losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the allowances established  there can be no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same bad debt loss rates 
as of january   there were no known situations with any of the company s major customers which would indicate the customer s inability to make their required payments 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
the cost of finished goods and component inventories  held by overseas subsidiaries  are determined using average cost 
the company s management regularly reviews its sales to customers and customers sell through at retail to determine excess or obsolete inventory reserves 
inventory with less than acceptable turn rates is classified as discontinued and  together with the related component parts which can be assembled into saleable finished goods  is sold through the company s outlet stores 
when management determines that finished product and components are unsaleable in the company s outlet stores  a reserve is established for the cost of those products and components 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements depending on future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions which may differ from our expectations 
long lived assets the company periodically reviews the estimated useful lives of its depreciable assets based on factors including historical experience  the expected beneficial service period of the asset  the quality and durability of the asset and the company s maintenance policy including periodic upgrades 
changes in useful lives are made on a prospective basis unless factors indicate the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable and an impairment write down is necessary 
warranty all watches sold by the company are covered by limited warranties against defects in material and workmanship for periods ranging from one to ten years from the date of purchase for movements and up to five years for the gold plating for movado watch cases and bracelets 
the company records an estimate for future warranty costs based on historical repair costs 
warranty costs have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established 
if such costs were to substantially exceed estimates  this could have an adverse affect on the company s operating results 
income taxes the company follows statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax laws and tax rates  in each jurisdiction the company operates  and applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities due to a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  the amounts of any future tax benefits are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent such benefits are not expected to be realized on a more likely than not basis 
the company calculates estimated income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for both book and tax purposes

the decrease in distribution and general and administrative expenses of million resulted from the inclusion of a million one time severance and early retirement charge in the fiscal results  and reductions in travel and entertainment  payroll and other operating expenses as a result of on going cost reduction initiatives 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in bonus expense  higher rental expense and higher legal and bad debt expenses

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was the result of the us recession and the economic conditions resulting from the tragic events surrounding september  domestic brand sales decreased by or million 
the domestic sales decline was the result of the economic uncertainty that surrounded the second half of fiscal  which resulted in our retailers delaying their purchases so that they were much closer to their selling season and their reluctance to build their inventory levels 
these sales declines were partially offset by the launch of the tommy hilfiger brand
