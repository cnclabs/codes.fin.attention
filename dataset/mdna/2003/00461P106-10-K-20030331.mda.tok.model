item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were formed by a spin off transaction from soane technologies  inc that was incorporated in and subsequently changed its name to c optics  inc we were incorporated in delaware in under the name soane biosciences  inc and changed our name in to aclara biosciences  inc 
aclara is a leading developer of assay chemistry for life science research 
since our inception we have engaged primarily in research and development activities related to the application of our proprietary microfluidics and assay chemistry technologies to genomic and proteomic applications in the field of drug discovery and development 
essentially all our revenues to date have been generated from commercial research collaborations and from government grants 
total revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
substantially all of these revenues have been derived from collaborations and grants that will not be active in our sources of potential revenue in and for the next several years are likely to be primarily from commercialization of our etag assay chemistries 
in late  we introduced commercial access programs under which customers can gain access to our etag assay system 
we have invested substantial amounts in establishing our assay chemistries for life science research 
from our inception to december   we have incurred million in research and development expenses 
over of our employees at december  were engaged in research and development activities 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million and total stockholders equity was million 
operating expenses were million including a million charge related to restructuring and million related to litigation settlement  million including a million charge related to settlements of litigation and million including a million charge related to settlements of litigation for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over at least the next two years as we continue to invest heavily in research and development activities  build our sales and marketing organizations and commercialize our etag products 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
our total revenues for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
our revenues to date have derived primarily from commercial collaboration agreements and government grants 
variations in these revenues have derived from the timing and amount of the award of the government grants and the completion of the collaboration efforts 
revenue from product sales has not been material 
substantially all of these revenues have been derived from collaborations and grants that will not be active in our sources of potential revenue in and for the next several years are likely to be primarily from commercialization of our etag assay chemistries 
in late  we introduced commercial access programs under which customers can gain access to our etag assay system 
under the etag expert access program  customers can gain access to etag assays for gene expression profiling  protein expression analysis  and cell surface antigen assays 
this is a license based program under which customers can buy etag reagent kits  software  custom assay services  and consulting support 
under the discovery partners program  customers can gain access to applications that may allow them to discover and adopt novel drug targets  lead compounds  protein and antibody therapeutics and diagnostics 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
research and development expenses were essentially unchanged in total for and increased expense in related to the first of two million minimum royalty payments under a litigation settlement was offset by a decrease of million in personnel and project expenses and a million decrease in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased staffing and other project and personnel related costs  being partially offset by a reduction of million in stock based compensation expense 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 
essentially all of our research and development expenditures are now focused on developing the etag assay system and on expanding the applications for which it can be used 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million from to was primarily due to increased personnel expenses related to an increase in marketing and business development staffing and activity 
the decrease from to was primarily due to a reduction of million in litigation related legal fees  being partially offset by an increase in expenses related to the number of personnel in the marketing and business development functions we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to be substantial as we commercialize our products  and as a result of the administrative and support infrastructure required to support our operations 
litigation settlements 
as part of the litigation settlement with caliper   shares of aclara common stock were issued in march with a guaranteed liquidation price of per share if caliper sold the shares after august  but before february  aclara initially valued the put obligation associated with these shares at million 
based on the change in aclara s stock price and in accordance with eitf no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf no 
and its related interpretations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities sfas  the put obligation was subsequently revalued on a quarterly basis and at december   march   june  and september   the put obligation had a value of million  million  million  and respectively 
as a result of these revaluations  revaluation expenses of million and million were recorded in the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the revaluation of the put obligation used a black scholes pricing model with changes in valuation being recorded in the statements of operations 
see note in the accompanying notes to financial statements 

table of contents in october  we paid caliper million related to this settlement 
of this amount approximately million was for the repurchase at the then current market price of the  shares previously issued to caliper in the original settlement agreement 
on february  the letter of credit that had been issued to secure our performance under the settlement agreement was terminated 
restructuring 
during the third quarter of aclara initiated a restructuring plan to streamline our operations  reduce costs associated with the microfluidics aspect of our business and increase our focus on our etag assay chemistry 
accordingly  we recognized a restructuring charge of million during the third quarter  including million of severance and related costs related to the reduction of our employment level by over employees 
this reduction was phased in over the second half of and primarily affected the microfluidics area of our business  where essentially all of our active programs were eliminated 
termination benefits related to severance packages  out placement services and other associated costs are included in restructuring expense on the statement of operation and restructuring accrual on the balance sheet at december  we also wrote off approximately million of fixed assets that are not expected to be used prospectively 
the following table sets forth an analysis of the components of the restructuring charges in thousands severance fixed other and benefits assets charges total restructuring provision severance and benefits property and equipment write off other charges total non cash charges cash paid reserve balance at december  aclara anticipates the remaining reserve of  will be substantially paid out by the first quarter of interest income expense  net 
interest income expense net represents income earned on our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  long term investments and restricted cash  and interest paid on bridge loans  capital leases and equipment loans 
net interest income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income from to and to was primarily due to lower average balances in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments and lower market interest rates 
extraordinary loss 
in  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million related to the early payoff of capital leases and equipment financing loans 
these leases and loans were paid off on september  with a cash payment totaling million 
income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses in  and and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and california research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
if not utilized  the net operating losses and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
see note in the accompanying notes to financial statements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through our initial public offering in march that raised net proceeds of million  private placements of preferred stock totaling million  loans from the landlord of our mountain view facility and equipment financing lines of credit totaling million  capital leases totaling million  and research and development funding from collaborators and government grants 
as of december   we had total cash resources of million  comprising million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term marketable investments  million in long term marketable investments and million in restricted cash 
the restrictions on this restricted cash balance were eliminated in february upon the termination of the underlying letter of credit that had been issued in relation to a litigation settlement 
although the litigation settlement amount was fully paid in october  the letter of credit securing that payment was not cancelled until february financing activities used cash of  for the year ended december  and provided cash of  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts represent the net proceeds that we received from the sale of preferred stock  common stock and proceeds from stockholder notes receivable being offset by repayments of equipment financing loans and capital leases and a repurchase of stock 
in october  we repurchased for million  shares of common stock previously issued to caliper in relation to a litigation settlement 
in march  we completed an initial public offering of  shares of common stock at an offering price of per share  raising net proceeds of million 
our operating activities used cash of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
uses of cash in operating activities primarily resulted from operating losses adjusted for non cash expenses and changes in working capital and other liabilities 
included in was million related to the payment of a previous litigation settlement  million minimum royalties related to the same litigation settlement and million of inventory purchases 
excluding these items  cash used in operations was million  substantially less than net loss due to non cash charges included in net loss 
as part of our investing activities  cash outflows for additions of property and equipment were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in we purchased a license for million from third wave 
a loan agreement with the landlord of our mountain view facility allowed us to borrow  for leasehold improvements at an annual interest rate of 
the principal balance of this loan at december  was  the note matures on july  
table of contents in march  aclara entered into a ten year operating lease agreement for our mountain view facility 
the future annual minimum loan payments including accrued interest and lease payments under the loan and lease agreements at december  are as follows in thousands years ending december  capital lease commitments loan payments operating lease commitments and thereafter total minimum loan and lease payments amount representing interest present value of minimum lease payments we are involved in certain litigation as discussed in note of notes to financial statements 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable investment balances and funding anticipated from collaborators and customers will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
after that time  we cannot be certain that additional funding  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
despite our expectations  we may need to raise additional capital in the future 
we may raise additional funds through public or private financing  collaborative relationships or other arrangements 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
as part of our litigation settlement with caliper  we provided a letter of credit to caliper in the amount of million as a guarantee of our performance under the settlement agreement 
the banking institution that issued the letter of credit required us to maintain a balance of of the letter of credit amount in a segregated account 
this amount of million is recorded as restricted cash in our financial statements at december  in october  we paid caliper million related to this settlement 
of this amount  approximately million was for the repurchase at the then current market price of the  shares previously issued to caliper in the original settlement agreement 
on february  the letter of credit was terminated and the restricted cash was released 
critical accounting policies aclara regularly reviews its selection and application of significant accounting policies and related financial disclosures 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the accompanying notes to financial statements 
the application of these accounting policies requires that management make estimates and judgments 
on an ongoing basis  aclara evaluates its estimates  which are based on historical experience and market and other conditions and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to actual market and other conditions  and assumptions being significantly different than was anticipated at the time of preparation of these estimates 
such differences may affect future financial results 
we believe the following estimates reflect the application of our most critical accounting policies and require our most significant judgments 
revenue recognition 
aclara recognizes revenue from government grants in the period in which research and development costs are incurred 
non refundable milestone payments received related to substantive at risk milestones are recognized when our performance of the milestone under the terms of the collaboration is 
table of contents achieved and there are no further performance obligations 
research and development fees from commercial collaboration agreements are generally recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the life of the collaboration agreement or as the research work is performed 
any amounts received in advance of performance  or with ongoing obligations still present  are deferred until performance has been completed and such obligations have been met 
product revenue is recognized when title and risk of ownership has transferred  remaining obligations are insignificant and collection of any remaining related account receivable is reasonably assured 
aclara did not offer warranties on its products sold through december  litigation settlements 
as part of the litigation settlement with caliper   shares of aclara common stock were issued in march with a guaranteed liquidation price of per share if caliper sold the shares after august  but before february  in accordance with  eitf no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock eitf no 
and its related interpretations  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities sfas  the put obligation associated with these shares was revalued on a quarterly basis until it was settled 
aclara estimates the fair value of the put obligation using a black scholes pricing model with changes in valuation being recorded in the statement of operations 
the black scholes pricing model requires certain estimates and assumptions  including estimated volatility of aclara s common stock and estimated life of the put obligation 
on october   aclara made a payment of million to caliper related to this settlement of litigation and put obligation 
from time to time  aclara may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
management considers such claims on case by case basis 
we accrue for loss contingencies if both of the following conditions are met information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
future changes in these estimates may require us to record additional reserves and may materially affect our results of operations  financial condition and future cash flows 
cash equivalents and marketable investments 
aclara maintains investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
aclara considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
management determines the appropriate classification of its short term and long term marketable investment securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such determination as of each balance sheet date 
at december   these investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
management also assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of aclara to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
inventory 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined under the first in  first out method 
we review inventories periodically and reduce items considered to be slow moving or obsolete to estimated net realizable value through an appropriate reserve 
no reserve was provided as of 
table of contents december   however if our estimates of the market value or demand of our inventory are more favorable than actual market conditions  we may be required to make inventory write downs in the future 
we had inventories with a carrying value of million at december  recent accounting pronouncements for recent accounting pronouncements  see note in the accompanying notes to financial statements 
factors affecting operating results the following risk factors outline certain risks and uncertainties concerning future results and should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this annual report on form k 
any of these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and future growth prospects 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
we have a history of operating losses and an accumulated deficit  and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
since we were founded in may  we have engaged primarily in research and development efforts 
we have incurred operating losses every year since inception  and we may never achieve profitability 
net losses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities  from litigation settlement charges and from selling  general and administration costs associated with our operations 
to date  we have not generated any significant revenue from the sale of products 
our ability to generate revenues from product sales or to achieve profitability is dependent on our ability  alone or with collaborative partners  to successfully design  develop  manufacture and commercialize our proprietary assay chemistry systems in a timely manner 
our revenue to date has been generated principally from collaborative research and development agreements  government grants and commercial collaborations related to our former microfluidics activities 
none of these revenue sources are expected to be significant in  when our etag assay system is anticipated to be the primary source of revenue 
we expect that our costs will continue to exceed our revenues on an annual basis for at least the next two years 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the willingness of our customers to enter into our access programs and the adoption of our technologies by customers  the timing of the release  and the competitiveness of our products  expiration or termination of contracts with collaborators or government research grants  which may not be renewed or replaced  final outcome of litigation to which we are currently a party or threatened claims against us  disagreements regarding intellectual property rights  and 
table of contents general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our customers research and development expenditures and use of our products 
if revenue declines in a quarter  whether due to a delay in recognizing expected revenue or otherwise  our earnings will decline because many of our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
in particular  research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses are not affected directly by variations in revenue 
due to fluctuations in our revenue and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons to results of historical operations are not a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future quarter or quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  or will be below the level of prior periods 
in these cases  our stock price could fluctuate significantly or decline 
none of our products has yet been successfully commercialized 
we are in the process of commercially launching our etag assay chemistries  through our expert access program and discovery partners program 
however  we have limited experience with developing  manufacturing  distributing or selling commercial products 
we may not be able to perfect the design of our products due to the complexity of the technologies on which they are based and or the demands of the scientific processes that they address 
additionally we may not be able to adequately provide the desired level of services required under our access programs 
for instance  we have limited experience establishing the high degrees of accuracy  reliability and ease of use required for commercial introduction of our products and services 
even though we have designed products that function in a prototype system or on a limited volume basis  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt the design or develop our organization to allow for large scale manufacturing 
although we have projected launch periods for certain of our products  we cannot assure you that we will complete development of the products by those launch dates  or at all 
if we are unable to design commercially viable assay chemistry products  or other products or systems  either independently or with our collaborative partners  we may be unable to remain in business 
commercialization of our products depends on market acceptance of our assay chemistry technology 
if this does not achieve acceptance  our ability to generate sales would be limited and our losses would increase 
demand for our products is substantially dependent upon widespread market acceptance of our assay chemistry products for applications in drug discovery and for applications in genomics  proteomics and pharmaceutical drug screening 
our assay chemistry products represent a new technological approach  and our ability to sell assay chemistry products will depend on the willingness of customers to adopt such new technological approaches 
we cannot assure you that our assay chemistry products will achieve substantial acceptance in our target markets 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate to potential customers the benefits and cost effectiveness of our assay chemistry products  relative to competing technologies and products  the extent and success of our efforts to market  sell and distribute the assay chemistry products  and adoption of the systems biology approach to drug discovery and development 
further  failure of our initial assay chemistry products to be favorably received by the market could undermine our ability to successfully introduce subsequent assay chemistry products 
if our assay chemistry products do not gain market acceptance  our losses would increase and we may be unable to remain in business 

table of contents our direct and third party sales and marketing channels need to be developed 
if we are unable to do so successfully  we may be unable to generate significant revenues 
we do not have fully developed sales and distribution channels for our products 
we have recently restructured our relationship with third wave and have assumed direct responsibility for the commercialization of etag assay chemistry products for the gene expression market that incorporate third wave s technology 
in addition  for applications in proteomics  we will continue to be dependent on our own sales and marketing organization  which has yet to be fully developed 
we may not be able to successfully recruit executive management and sales and marketing personnel to market and sell our products 
our ability to generate revenues will be dependent on the development of the appropriate partnerships  on the resources devoted by our partners to commercialization activities and on the success of those activities 
our ability to generate revenue will also be dependent on our success in recruiting management and business development personnel and in building a sales and marketing organization 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully build and manage effective sales and distribution channels  or that our partners will devote sufficient resources to our commercialization efforts to be effective 
if we are unable to effectively protect our intellectual property  we would be unable to prevent third parties from using our technology  which could impair our ability to compete in the market 
the cost of enforcing our proprietary rights may be expensive and result in increased losses 
we may be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain meaningful patent protection for our products  both in the united states and in other countries  and our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
we rely on our portfolio of over issued and pending patent applications in the united states and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
we cannot assure you that any of the currently pending or future patent applications will be issued as patents  or that any patents issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
further  we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information or that adequate remedies would exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
the exposure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
further  we cannot assure you that others have not or will not independently develop substantially equivalent know how and technology 
our commercial success also depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents or proprietary rights and the breach of any licenses that may relate to our technologies and products 
we are aware of various third party patents that may relate to our technology 
we believe that we do not infringe these patents but cannot assure you that we will not be found in the future to infringe these or other patents or proprietary rights of third parties  either with products we are currently developing or with new products that we may seek to develop in the future 
if third parties assert infringement claims against us  we may be forced to enter into license arrangements with them 
we cannot assure you that we could enter into the required licenses on commercially reasonably terms  if at all 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or to implement alternative approaches may prevent us from commercializing products under development and would impair our ability to be commercially 
table of contents competitive 
we may also become subject to interference proceedings conducted in the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of inventions 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property suits  us patent and trademark office interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings will result in substantial expense to us  and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
further  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised during the discovery process of any litigation 
during the course of any lawsuit  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
we have limited manufacturing experience and will be subject to the risk of developing and maintaining relationships with third party manufacturers and suppliers and the risk of impairment in value of inventory 
we have no experience manufacturing our products in the high volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales 
to date  we have limited our manufacturing activities to low volume manufacturing of etag assay chemistry products for testing purposes and for validation use by our collaborative partners and potential customers 
the nature of our assay chemistries necessitates access to specialized chemicals  reagents and raw materials  such as antibodies used in conjunction with our etag components 
there are only a limited number of vendors who supply these materials and for some of these materials the suppliers are the sole source of supply 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully secure supply of all needed materials  nor can we be certain that these vendors will supply these materials consistently or in the quantities necessary for high volume production 
we will need to enter into contractual relationships with these or other manufacturers to facilitate commercial scale production of etag assay chemistry products  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on a timely basis  for sufficient quantities of products or on commercially reasonable terms 
we will need to secure supply of antibodies for use in our protein applications and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms 
we will be dependent on third wave  for supply of cleavase enzyme that is a critical component of products that we will commercialize for gene expression applications and this enzyme is proprietary to third wave 
failure of third wave to supply enzyme could seriously impair our business 
pursuant to the supply agreement with third wave  we purchased an initial quantity of cleavase enzyme from third wave 
this initial quantity of enzyme represents more than one year s supply 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that we can establish or maintain reliable  high volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 
in addition  the loss of any of these suppliers may result in a delay or interruption of our supply of assay chemistries 
any significant delay or interruption would have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply adequate quantities of our products and would result in lost revenues 
in addition  we have limited experience in developing and providing the software tools necessary to perform analyses of data derived from our etag assays 
we depend on our key personnel  the loss of whom would impair our ability to compete 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our senior management and key scientific and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management  scientific or technical staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of product development and other business objectives 
table of contents and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit and retain additional qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
there is currently a shortage of skilled executives and intense competition for such personnel in the areas of our activities  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the development of our business 
the inability to attract and retain the necessary scientific  technical and managerial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our research and development activities  sales revenue  operating costs and future growth prospects 
we expect intense competition in our target markets 
we compete with companies that design  manufacture and market analytical instruments and reagents for genomics  proteomics and pharmaceutical drug screening using alternate technologies for applications such as gene expression analysis and protein function analysis and other products and systems 
in addition  a number of companies are developing new technologies for miniaturizing various laboratory procedures for genomics  proteomics and drug screening markets targeted by us  using such methods as beads  hybridization chips and high density microwell plates 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as companies enter the market with new technologies 
rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  emerging competition and new product introduction  characterize the markets for our products 
one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical by advances in existing technological approaches or the development of different approaches 
many of these competitors have greater financial and personnel resources and more experience in research and development than we have 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively with the competitor s greater market presence 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are our potential customers or our strategic partners will not develop competing products 
we may be subject to product liability claims and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance  which would increase our losses if such claims occurred 
as we begin commercialization of our products  we will face exposure to product liability claims 
any product liability claims arising in the future  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  could increase our losses 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to maintain our current coverage or obtain new insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage  or at reasonable costs 
in addition  potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of our insurance or may be excluded from coverage under the terms of the policy 
we may be unable to raise additional capital when needed or generate the capital necessary to expand our operations and invest in new products  which could hurt our ability to compete or achieve profitability 
it might be necessary for us to raise additional capital over the next few years to continue our research and development efforts and to commercialize our products 
we believe that the proceeds from our initial public offering and projected revenue from collaborations should be sufficient to fund our anticipated levels of operations through at least the next months 
however  we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that existing or potential future collaborations or sales revenue will be adequate to fund our operations 
we may need additional funds sooner than planned to meet operational needs  capital requirements for product development and commercialization and payment of monetary damages in any on going or future litigation 
we cannot assure you that additional funds will be available when needed  or on terms acceptable to us  or that sufficient revenue will be generated from sales 
if adequate funds are not available  we may have to reduce substantially or eliminate expenditures for the development and production of certain of our proposed 
table of contents products or obtain funds through arrangements with collaboration partners that require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or products 
either of these alternatives could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers  directors and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
our executive officers  directors and their affiliates presently beneficially own or control a significant percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  our current executive officers  directors and their affiliates  if acting together  would have the ability to influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors  any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and any other significant corporate transactions 
the concentration of ownership could also delay or prevent a change of control of our company at a premium price if these stockholders oppose it 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile 
there has only been a public market for our common stock since march   and since then our common stock has traded in a range between and per share 
the trading price of our common stock may continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  our ability to successfully commercialize our products  technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  developments concerning government regulations or proprietary rights which could affect the potential growth of our customers  the execution of new collaborative agreements and material changes in the relationships with business partners  market reaction to trends in revenues and expenses  especially research and development  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  sales of common stock by existing stockholders  and economic and political conditions 
the market price for our common stock may also be affected by our ability to meet analysts expectations 
any failure to meet such expectations  even slightly  could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the stock market  and the nasdaq national market and the market for technology companies in particular  is subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility has had a significant effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subjects of securities class action litigation  and as noted elsewhere in this form k  we have been sued in a securities class action lawsuit 
although we believe that the class action lawsuit and the other lawsuits described elsewhere in this form k are without merit  an adverse determination in any of the lawsuits could have a very significant effect on our business and results of operations  and could materially affect the price of our stock 
moreover  regardless of the ultimate result  it is likely that the lawsuits will divert management s attention and resources from other matters  which could also adversely affect our business and the price of our stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law limit the ability of another party to acquire us  which could cause our stock price to decline 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  we have a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three year terms and are removable only for cause 
in addition  on march   aclara adopted a stockholder rights plan the rights plan 
pursuant to the 
table of contents rights plan  aclara s board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right a right on each outstanding share of aclara s common stock 
each right will entitle stockholders to buy one one hundredth of a share of newly created series a junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of in the event that the rights become exercisable 
subject to limited exceptions  the rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of the company s common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of the common stock 
if aclara is acquired in a merger or other business combination transaction which has not been approved by the board of directors  each right will entitle its holder to purchase  at the right s then current exercise price  a number of the acquiring company s common shares having a market value at the time of twice the right s exercise price 
these provisions may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  control of aclara 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which may prohibit large stockholders from consummating a merger or combination with us 
these factors could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for our common stock in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at an average maturity of generally less than two years 
the following tables present the hypothetical changes in fair values in aclara s cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable investments held at december  that are sensitive to the changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps 
fair values represent the market principal plus accrued interest at december  in thousands 
given an interest rate decrease of x basis points given an interest rate increase of x basis points issuer bps bps bps bps bps bps bps money market bonds of us government and its agencies the weighted average maturity of aclara s long term marketable investments at december  was days 
with the exception of the put obligation associated with the settlement of litigation  we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion
