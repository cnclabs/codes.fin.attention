the company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with its taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that prior to january  of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing the company continues to qualify as a reit  it will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
however  the company s service companies are subject to federal income tax 
on december   as part of a larger bill  the reit modernization act rma was signed into law

critical accounting policies and estimates 
the consolidated financial statements of the company include accounts of the company  all subsidiaries  the service companies and the operating partnership structured as a downreit 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized information available including industry practice and its own past history in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
real estate and depreciation 
real estate assets are stated at the lower of cost or fair value  as appropriate  less accumulated depreciation 
costs related to the acquisition  development  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized including interest  internal wages and benefits  real estate taxes and insurance 
capitalization usually begins with commencement of development activity and ends when the property is ready for leasing 
replacements and improvements  such as hvac equipment  structural replacements  windows  appliances  flooring  carpeting and kitchen bath replacements and renovations are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives as follows buildings and improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties and improvements for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
ordinary repairs and maintenance  such as unit cleaning and painting and appliance repairs are expensed 
the company generally classifies properties as properties held for sale when all significant contingencies surrounding the closing have been resolved 
in most transactions  these contingencies are not satisfied until the actual closing of the transaction and  accordingly  the property is not identified as held for sale until the closing actually occurs 
however  each potential transaction is evaluated based on its separate facts and circumstances 
the company follows a practice of discontinuing the depreciation of assets specifically identified by management as held for sale 
a valuation allowance is established for any asset so identified if in management s opinion  the net sales price of the asset is less than its net book value 
when there is an impairment indicator  the company determines whether a real estate asset is impaired 
in performing this analysis  the company determines the range of potential alternatives and assigns a probability of the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the alternatives considered or the probability of the occurrence thereof change  an impairment may result which could materially impact the results of operations of the company 
revenue recognition 
the company s residential property leases are for terms of generally one year or less 
rental income is recognized on the straight line basis 
retroactive revenue increases related to budget based affordable housing properties are generally recognized based on rental applications submitted and approved by hud 
acquisition  management and disposition fees  and other fees are recognized when the related services are performed and the earnings process is complete 
servicing fee income related to pension fund loans is recognized when earned and is included in other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
rent concessions  including free rent and leasing commissions paid to third parties  incurred in connection with residential property leases are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases generally one year and are charged as a reduction of rental revenues 
accrued liabilities 
the company s policy for the establishment and maintenance of a reserve for liabilities is as follows a reserve will be established for existing matters based on the criteria established in fas accounting for contingencies as defined a information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
finally  once a reserve has been established  it will not be reversed until such time that the event or circumstances that resulted in the reserve being established have been resolved 
quarterly  each reserve will be reviewed to determine if additional reserves are required based on new information or whether the event that triggered the reserve has now been removed 
liquidity and capital resources 
the company anticipates that it will meet its liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through its net cash provided by operations  secured borrowings primarily through the use of the company s two lines of credit  which had million available at december   property sales proceeds and possible issuance of debt or equity securities 
the company believes that these sources will be sufficient to meet operating requirements  capital additions  mortgage amortization payments and the payment of dividends in accordance with reit requirements 
the company anticipates the following commitments for capital expenditures for 
million for recurring capital expenditures 
this includes replacement of worn carpet and appliances and property common area parking lots  roofs and similar matters in accordance with the company s current property expenditure plan 
this commitment is expected to be funded largely from cash flow from operating activities 

million for investment revenue enhancing expenditures 
this commitment is expected to be funded largely from borrowings on the company s lines of credit 

 for non recurring capital expenditures 
this commitment is expected to be funded largely from cash flow from operating activities 
the company has a shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission relating to a possible offering of up to million of debt securities  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
although million of mtn s remain available under the shelf registration  it s unlikely that the company will have access to the market for mtn securities in the near future due to the current value of the company s shares and its current financial condition 
while the company currently estimates that its net cash from operations for should approximate  certain factors could adversely impact the company s results of operations in including  but not limited to  low mortgage interest rates  continuation of a recessionary economy primarily employment levels and higher than anticipated insurance costs 
if mortgage interest rates remain low  tenants may elect to purchase their own home rather than rent  thereby adversely impacting occupancy levels 
occupancy levels could also be adversely impacted if the economy continues to remain weak or further deteriorates as tenants may lose their jobs  default on their leases  and defer renting an apartment 
the company s total rental revenue collections are impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels  which the company may attempt to adjust from time to time in order to maintain projected revenues 
additionally  rising property insurance costs could dramatically increase the company s property operating expenses in impacting the company s net cash provided by operations and net income 
the company believes that if net cash is below projections  the other sources of cash previously mentioned will be sufficient to cover the liquidity requirements of the company

insurance 
the september  terrorist attack on new york s world trade center and its aftermath has created a number of uncertainties for the company concerning the management of its insurance risks 
the company renewed its blanket insurance policy for the period april  to march  at greater cost with less protection 
the company is not alone in facing these dilemmas 
since september  insurance costs have risen dramatically across the industry  many insurers have significantly reduced their capacity positions and many others have refused to insure against acts of terrorism 
accordingly  for the current policy periods  the company was faced with an approximate increase in property and liability insurance premiums coupled with reduced insurance protection 
when the company renewed its current property insurance policy  the company was unable to obtain quotes for terrorism insurance at any price 
in august  the company was successful in obtaining million of insurance protection for terrorist related risks for the company s owned and managed portfolio  which was approved by the company s major lenders 
insurance coverage issues are a matter of concern not only for the company and its shareholders  but also the company s lenders who may assert their own concerns over increased risk exposure brought about by reduced insurance coverage 
the company believes that its current insurance coverage is representative of what is commercially available and reasonably acceptable in today s often chaotic insurance environment

the amount of each monthly hap payment is equal to the rent amount the contract rent stated in the hap contract with hud  less the amount payable by the eligible resident for such month 
below is a table setting forth the current expiration dates of the hap contracts and the hap revenue recognized for the company s affordable housing properties in thousands final revenue recognized during property expiration date ellet development december hillwood i july lakeshore village joint venture a october puritas place september st

all thirteen properties shown in the above table had positive cash flow during and are anticipated to have positive cash flow for the remaining contract terms 
therefore  none of the hap contracts are considered to be loss contracts 
contract rents may be adjusted at least annually in accordance with the annual adjustment factor method for some of the properties 
generally  these types of adjustments are only permitted if current rents are below the hud published fair market rent fmr threshold 
if current rents exceed fmrs  a rent comparability study must be completed to demonstrate that the property s rents are below market 
prior to hap contract expiration  contract renewal request forms must be submitted by the company days prior to the hap anniversary date to hud or its corresponding contract agent in order to renew the existing hap contract 
current options available to the company for the expiring hap contracts are as follows i renew at current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor that is set by hud on an annual basis 
these rents are below the market comparisons for properties that have a mortgage  ii renew at current rents plus an operating cost adjustment factor for properties without a mortgage  or  iii opt out of the section program 
opting out of the section program requires an additional one year notice to hud or the contract agent and the affected residents 
the company believes  that upon expiration of the contracts  the contracts will be renewed  or the company will enter into another government subsidized or mortgage restructuring program  or that the properties will be operated as conventional  market rate properties 
the following represents the company s current expectations concerning those hap contracts which expire in shaker park gardens ii 
on november   the company requested a referral to omhar office of multifamily housing and restructuring for the restructuring of the mortgage and reduction of section rents to comparable market rents  and to renew the hap contract which was extended at current rents until june  to allow for completion of restructuring negotiations 
the company did not accept the terms of the mortgage restructure agreement  as written by hud  and chose not to accept the commitment 
on june   the company paid the existing mortgage note in full 
the mortgage pre payment provided exemption from omhar and eligibility for an operating cost adjustment factor ocaf increase  based on the company s interpretation of hud regulations 
however  hud rejected this proposal and reduced contract rents to those stipulated in the mortgage restructure agreement 
the company is currently engaged in a formal appeal of these actions 
lakeshore village 
on october   the company requested a referral to omhar for the full restructuring of the mortgage and reduction of section rents to comparable market rents  and to renew the hap contract which was extended at current rents until october on february   the partnership was notified by hud that the property is eligible for the full restructuring of the mortgage and that the property has been assigned to a participating administrative entity for further processing

these two properties were two of the three properties of which the company became the owner as a result of the previously discussed joint venture exchange

for  capitalized interest was million compared to million for for the market rate properties  interest expense decreased  or when comparing to this decrease was primarily a result of lower outstanding balances as the majority of the first mortgages secured by market rate properties require monthly principal amortization payments

management s belief is that the effects of inflation would be minimal on the operational performance of its portfolio primarily due to the high correlation between inflation and housing costs combined with the short term nature  typically one year  of the leases 
the company also faces limited exposure to interest rate fluctuations due to its high proportion of fixed rate financing 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   the company had million of variable rate debt 
additionally  the company has interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
management has and will continue to manage interest rate risk as follows i maintain a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii use treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
management uses various financial models and advisors to assist them in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives 
from time to time  the company may enter into hedge agreements to minimize its exposure to interest rate risks 
in april and may  the company completed two interest rate swaps 
the notional amounts of the swaps are approximately million

the sensitivity to changes in interest rates of the company s fixed rate debt was determined with a valuation model based upon changes that measure the net present value of such obligation which arise from the hypothetical estimate as discussed above 
contingencies environmental 
there are no recorded amounts resulting from environmental liabilities and there are no known material contingencies with respect thereto 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted 
furthermore  no condition is known to exist that would give rise to a material liability for site restoration  post closure and monitoring commitments  or other costs that may be incurred with respect to the sale or disposal of a property
