item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates general our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  and warranty and installation obligations 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  foreign currency translation  the valuation of inventories including demonstration inventory and accounting for the costs of installation and warranty obligations to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation process included in each such policy 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from equipment sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price of the goods and services being sold is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred or services rendered and we are reasonably assured that we will collect payment 
generally  we recognize revenue on shipment  as the equipment is pre tested in the factory prior to shipment and our terms of business are fob factory 
for new customers  or new products  revenue is recognized on shipment only if the customer attends and approves the pre shipment testing procedures and we  and the customer  are satisfied that the performance of the equipment  once installed and operated  will meet the customer defined specifications 
generally  even with new customers we recognize the revenue on shipment because the customer attends and approves the pre shipment testing 
the amount of revenue recorded is reduced by the amount of any customer retention typically between and  which is not payable by the customer until installation is completed and final customer acceptance is achieved 
the amount of customer retentions deferred at december  was million compared to million at december  the provision of installation and commissioning services are not considered essential to the functionality of the equipment 

back to index equipment sold as demonstration or evaluation units are recognized for revenue on transfer of title and either final acceptance  or satisfactory completion of testing to demonstrate that the equipment meets all the customer defined specifications 
revenue related to spare parts is recognized on shipment and revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
foreign currency translation most of our operations are located within the united kingdom and most of our costs are incurred in british pounds 
our system sales  however  are generally in us dollars and  to a lesser extent  in euros and we report in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the british pound have a significant effect on our reported earnings and net asset position 
we have determined that the functional currency for all uk operations is the british pound and as a result our actual expenses expressed in us dollars will fluctuate with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and result in currency gains and losses  which are charged to selling  general and administrative expenses 
changes in the value of non us net assets as a result of these movements of foreign currency exchange rates are treated as changes to the cumulative translation adjustment on the balance sheet 
selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  included a loss arising from foreign currency adjustments of  compared to a gain of million and million in the years ended december  and respectively 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  using standard costs which approximate to actual cost 
we maintain a perpetual inventory system and continuously record the quantity on hand and standard cost of each product including purchased components sub assemblies and finished goods 
we maintain the integrity of the perpetual inventory through a cycle stock count program 
our standard costs are re assessed at least annually and generally reflect the most recent purchase cost and currently achievable assembly and test labor and overhead rates 
we estimate our labor and overhead rates based upon average utilization rates and treat as a period cost abnormal absorption variances  which arise due to low or high production volumes 
in the current industry downturn  and low levels of production  significant negative volume variances are being experienced  which has resulted in the lower gross margin as compared to the prior year 
we also make provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory and evaluate their adequacy on a quarterly basis 
for our work in process and finished goods inventory  which generally consist of specific systems or modules  we compare the inventory on hand to current sales and market forecasts and other information that indicates the ability to identify a purchaser for such equipment 
we apply a formula approach to reserves against raw materials and spares inventory based upon months historic usage  applying different criteria to components that are required for current products  non current products and spares 
a major component of the estimate of inventory reserves is our estimate related to future customer demand  technological and or market obsolescence  the equipment operating life at the customer and general semiconductor market conditions 
if future customer demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  then additional inventory write downs may be required  and these would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the reserves were adjusted 
installation and warranty our contracts cover on site installation services and provide for a warranty of the machine 
generally  we accrue for the costs of installation and commissioning services at the time of revenue recognition 
our standard warranty period varies from to months  depending on a number of factors including the specific equipment purchased 
we account for the estimated warranty cost as a charge to cost of sales at the time we recognize revenue 
the warranty cost is based upon historic product performance and is based on a rolling month average historic cost per machine per warranty month outstanding 
we also recalculate the warranty liability for all remaining systems still under warranty using the most recent historic average and the difference is included as a component of cost of sales 
we do not maintain any general reserves for warranty obligations 
actual performance in the future may vary from historic costs  including the identification of defects not currently identified  which could result in adjustments to our warranty reserves in future periods that are more volatile than in recent years

product sales for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  shipments for the year ended december  were million compared to million shipped in the prior year 
the decline in sales and shipments in the year reflects the effects of the protracted and continuing global slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
our revenues in fiscal reflect our significant backlog from fiscal  prior to the onset of the current global slowdown 
our customers continue to be cautious regarding their capital expenditure plans and orders for our products remained depressed 
the protracted and continuing global slowdown in the semiconductor industry will continue to result in depressed levels of revenue for fiscal our sales by product are as follows year ended december  pvd cvd etch spares and service total 
back to index sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we expect that sales outside of the united states will continue to represent a significant percentage of our product sales through in addition  because of the large unit price associated with our systems  we anticipate that our product sales will continue to be made to a small number of customers in each quarter 
the quantity of product shipped may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and the individual customers to whom these products are sold can also change from quarter to quarter 
given the significance of each individual sale  the percentage of sales made outside of the united states may also fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
revenues for the year ended december  included cancellation fees of million 
license revenues 
license revenues of  in the year ended december  related to power supply technology 
no license revenues were earned during the year ended december  gross margin on product sales 
the gross margin on product revenues for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  cost of sales for the year ended december  included  relating to the costs of a reduction in workforce compared to  in the year ended december  cost of sales for the year ended december  also includes a non cash charge of million with respect to write off of inventory associated with the current downturn in the semiconductor business compared to a million write off in the prior year 
in addition  under utilization of manufacturing and customer support costs negatively affected the gross margin in the year ended december  sales of higher margin products and a receipt of fees for order cancellations offset  somewhat  the factors contributing to the reduced gross margin in the year ended december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million or of total revenues compared with million or of total revenues for the prior year 
the major focus of our research and development efforts continues to be the development of new processes in further advancing our proprietary pvd  cvd and etch technologies as well as adding enhancements to our existing products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenues  compared to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  includes losses arising from foreign currency adjustments of  compared to gains of million recognized in the prior year 
as a result of the continuing and severe downturn in the industry we have sought to control our selling general and administration costs 
while the reduction in selling general and administrative expenses when reported in us dollars for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was only  the movement in the us dollar exchange rate to the british pound had an adverse effect on selling general and administration by 
further  the inclusion of a gain in the year ended december  from foreign currency transactions of million also negatively affects the comparison of the two years 
result from operations 
as a result of the decrease in revenue for the year ended december  and our strategy to keep our key infrastructure in place during the current downturn  we incurred a loss from operations of million or of revenue compared with income from operations of million or of revenue in the prior year 
other income 
we earned  during the year ended december  in connection with the sale of property we no longer required for our operations 
interest income and expense  net 
net interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the achievement of interest income is due primarily to interest income received on increased cash balances during fiscal offsetting interest expense on the bank term loan 
in addition  interest cost on our subordinated convertible notes ceased in following their payment in full in october income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a tax credit of million compared to a charge of million for year ended december  resulting in an effective income tax rate of and  respectively 

back to index we generated a significant portion of our consolidated pre tax losses for the year ended december   and pre tax income for the year ended december   within the united kingdom  which has a lower statutory rate of compared to the us federal rate of 
in addition to the lower statutory rate  the generation and use of net operating losses results in fluctuations in the effective tax rate  as we have not recognized any deferred tax assets with respect to net operating losses  which can only be utilized against future profits 
we incurred united kingdom income taxes in fiscal and we were able to carry back some of the tax losses incurred in the united kingdom during fiscal against these taxes 
the remaining operating losses in the year ended december   are carried forward to future periods and we did not recognize a deferred tax asset with respect to these losses 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for a detailed reconciliation of the tax rate for and as of december   we had and us federal losses of million  various us state operating losses and united kingdom net operating losses of approximately million  which can be offset against future income 
our ability to use our us and united kingdom net operating losses and credit carry forwards will depend upon the ability to generate future income within the us and the united kingdom to utilize these losses and a portion of our us net operating losses are subject to annual limitations arising from a change of control as defined by s of the internal revenue code  as revised 
in addition to the united states and the united kingdom  we have operating subsidiaries in several other countries  and each of these subsidiaries are taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which they operate 
because taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot be used to offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other jurisdictions  our consolidated effective tax rate can vary significantly to the extent we reports tax losses in some subsidiaries and taxable income in others 
we also assume that our profits generated in overseas jurisdictions are reinvested overseas 
the payment of dividends or distributions by the subsidiaries to the united states may be subject to withholding taxes in the country of domicile and further taxation by federal or state authorities subject to the terms of relevant tax treaties 
comparison of the years ended december  and product sales 
product sales for the year ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the year ended december  shipments for the year ended december  were million compared to million shipped in the prior year 
the decline in sales and shipments in the year reflects the effects of the global slowdown in the semiconductor industry which commenced around the start of fiscal  and would have been more pronounced had we not had a backlog of million at the start of the fiscal year 
order levels dropped significantly in fiscal as our customers sharply reduced capital expenditures due to excess integrated circuit inventory levels and over capacity in the semiconductor industry 
revenues for year ended december  also include a million cancellation fee 
our sales by product are as follows year ended december  pvd cvd etch spares and service total sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
license revenues 
license revenues of  in the year ended december  related to power supply technology 
gross margin on product sales 
the gross margin on product revenues for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  cost of sales for the year ended december  included  relating to the costs of a reduction in workforce and a non cash charge of million with respect to write off of inventory associated with the current downturn in the semiconductor business 
in addition  under utilization of manufacturing and customer support costs negatively affected the gross margin in the year ended december  sales of higher margin products and a receipt of fees for order cancellations offset  somewhat  the factors contributing to the reduced gross margin 

back to index research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million or of total revenues compared with million or of total revenues for the prior year 
the major focuses of our research and development effort was the development of new processes in further advancing our proprietary pvd  cvd and etch technologies as well as adding enhancements to our existing products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  or of total revenues  compared to million  or of total revenues  in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses in the year ended december  include gains arising from foreign currency adjustments of million compared to gains of million recognized in the prior year 
income from operations 
as a result of the decrease in revenue for the year ended december   income from operations decreased to million or of revenue compared with million or of revenue in the prior year 
other income 
we earned  in connection with the sale of property that is no longer required for our operations 
interest expense  net 
net interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared with net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net interest expense in fiscal is due primarily to interest income received on increased cash balances offsetting interest expense on the bank term loan 
in addition  interest cost on our subordinated convertible notes decreased in compared to fiscal because certain of the notes were converted into common stock and the remaining notes were paid in full in october income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a tax charge of million compared to  for year ended december  resulting in an effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
for the years ended december  and  we generated a significant portion of our consolidated pre tax income within the united kingdom  which has a lower statutory rate of compared to the us federal rate of 
in addition to the lower statutory rate  we utilized united kingdom net operating losses in and for which no deferred tax asset had been recognized 
while in fiscal all the profits generated within the united kingdom were offset against net operating losses  only a residual amount of losses was available to offset against the fiscal profits 
see note of the notes to the financial statements for a detailed reconciliation of the tax rate for and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at december  the primary uses of cash in the year ended december  were operations  which used million 
in addition we invested million in property  plant and equipment  net of retirements and repaid million of our term loan facility with a british bank 
in april  our cash and cash equivalents were increased as a result of the sale of  shares of our common stock  in a private transaction with a group of institutional shareholders 
the net proceeds that we received amounted to approximately million 
in addition  the effect of exchange rate changes was an increase of million on our cash and cash equivalents at december  as at december   we had a term loan from a british bank with a balance outstanding of million british pounds and at december   two term loans totaling million british pounds approximately million and million  respectively  at the respective year end exchange rates 
the term loan at december  bears interest at the three month london interbank borrowing rate libor plus per annum payable at an annual rate of for the three month period ending march  and also carries no prepayment penalties 
under the terms of this loan we are required to pay an additional five equal installments of approximately million per quarter commencing january and a final repayment of million in march 
back to index the loan facility includes a financial covenant that we maintain the ratio of net borrowings to net worth at less than in addition  we must maintain net interest cost at below of profit before interest and taxes 
for the six month period ending june   the net interest cost covenant does not apply  and we will be allowed to incur net interest of  british pounds approximately  but we must comply with the net interest cost covenant for the six month period ending december  if we incur interest expense and revenues do not increase in or costs are not reduced  we may not be in compliance with this covenant and there can be no assurance that the bank will grant us an additional waiver 
the loan in question  however  matures in march and management believes that the failure to comply with the covenant will not result in an acceleration of the loan 
at december   our cash obligations and commitments relating to our debt obligations and lease payments are as follows less than year to years greater than years bank loan capital lease obligations operating lease obligations with the exception of the above operating leases we have no off balance sheet financing activities 
our cash balance of million combined with cash generated by operations will be our primary source of liquidity 
during the next months  we may use a substantial part of our cash balance to fund our current obligations and our operations and to make scheduled principal payments of million per quarter with respect to our bank debt 
the amount of cash reserves that we will use to fund our operations will depend on how long the current downturn in the semiconductor industry will last and its severity and our ability to reduce our operating expenses 
if the downturn continues longer than anticipated  we will continue to rely on our cash resources to fund operations  but management believes that the current cash balances the availability of loans under the existing and new credit facilities and potential cost reduction efforts  will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
in order to further strengthen our cash position  we may seek to raise additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to raise any additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors and other information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus before deciding to invest in our common stock 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
please see the special note regarding forward looking statements on page of this annual report on form k 
the semiconductor industry is experiencing a protracted and continuing downturn  which has harmed and may continue to harm our sales and profitability 
we sell our products to the semiconductor industry  which is subject to sudden variations in product supply and demand 
the industry is experiencing a protracted and continuing downturn at this time  the length and severity of which is difficult to estimate  but the downturn has significantly harmed our sales and may continue for the remainder of  but management does not know when conditions in the industry may improve 
even after the current downturn ends there can be no assurance that orders and sales will return to historical levels 
generally  the timing  length and severity of the cycles in the semiconductor industry are difficult to predict 
semiconductor manufacturers may contribute to these cycles by misinterpreting conditions in the industry and over or under investing in semiconductor manufacturing capacity and equipment 
we have little ability to anticipate or respond effectively to these industry cycles 
downturns in the semiconductor industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 

back to index industry downturns have been characterized by reduced demand for semiconductor devices and equipment  production over capacity and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
during a period of declining demand  to maintain our profitability  we must be able to quickly and effectively reduce expenses and motivate and retain key employees 
many of our expenses are fixed and our ability to reduce other expenses in response to any downturn in the semiconductor industry is limited by our need for continued investment in engineering and research and development and extensive ongoing customer service and support requirements 
in addition  the long lead time for production and delivery of our products  and the possibility of customer order cancellations  creates a risk that we may incur expenditures or purchase inventories for products which we cannot sell 
at the time the current downturn ends  we may not be in a position to meet our customers needs 
industry upturns have been characterized by abrupt increases in demand for semiconductor devices and equipment and production under capacity 
during a period of increasing demand and rapid growth  we must be able to quickly hire  train and assimilate a sufficient number of qualified personnel  particularly engineers  and obtain sufficient components in order to increase production to meet customer demand 
if we are unable to increase production on a timely basis in times of increased demand some of our existing or potential customers could place orders with our competitors and  as a result we may not be able to fully benefit from any industry upturn 
we will not be able to compete effectively if we fail to address the rapid technological change in the semiconductor industry 
the semiconductor industry and the semiconductor equipment industry are subject to rapid technological change and frequent introductions of enhancements to existing products  and if we are unable to develop and incorporate new technologies in our products  we will be unable to compete effectively and our business will be materially and adversely affected 
technological trends have had and will continue to have a significant impact on our business 
our results of operations and ability to remain competitive are largely based upon our ability to accurately anticipate customer and market requirements 
accordingly  we may be required to maintain a relatively high level of research and development spending  even at time of declining sales and profitability  in order to maintain our competitive position 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including appropriate technology and product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  effective sales and marketing  product performance in the field  and product support and service 
we may not be able to accurately forecast or respond to commercial and technical trends in the semiconductor industry or respond to specific product announcements by our competitors 
our competitors may be developing technologies and products that are more effective or that achieve more widespread acceptance 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our current and future products 
if our products are unreliable or do not meet our customers expectations  then reduced orders  higher manufacturing costs  delays in collecting accounts receivable or additional service and warranty expense could result 
we may also experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new systems or enhancements 
significant delays can occur between a product s introduction and the commencement of volume production of that product 
any of these events could negatively affect our ability to generate the return we intend to achieve on our investments in these new products 
we expect the semiconductor industry to migrate to the further use of copper and we will need to continue to adapt our products for use with copper and copper processes 
if we fail to make our products compatible with copper and copper processes at the time our competitors offer copper compatible products  our revenues and market share will be negatively affected 

back to index the semiconductor industry also has historically moved to larger diameter wafers requiring new equipment as a strategy to reduce manufacturing costs 
the maximum diameter of silicon wafers used in production is increasing from mm to mm 
while we have already shipped mm systems for our cvd products  we continue to develop the technology and solutions for our pvd and etch systems 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to complete the development of mm systems in time to meet market demand 
if our current products and our mm systems are not competitive or available at the correct time  we may lose customers or fail to gain new business from potential customers  which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and net earnings 
we have made significant investments in our low k technology  but the semiconductor industry has yet to adopt our technology 
we believe that our technology for the deposition of low k dielectrics is advanced compared to our competitors and we are dedicating significant resource to continue to lead in this field and to achieve the commercial sales of our low k systems 
however  the physical characteristics of low k films make the manufacturing process significantly more difficult than with existing insulating materials and  as a result  device manufacturers have been slow to adopt the use of low k materials and this adoption has been delayed during the current downturn 
device manufacturers continue to find alternative methods to manufacture devices at smaller feature sizes  and forgo the development and use of low k materials 
also  there can be no assurance that the industry will adopt a cvd method for the deposition of low k films 
other technologies for which we do not manufacture equipment could also be use for the deposition of low k films 
if we fail to continue to develop our low k cvd solution to achieve all the specifications required by device manufacturers  or our competitors develop competing low k solutions  then our ability to grow our revenues and market share from these products would be negatively affected 
our operational results could be negatively affected by currency fluctuations 
we are based in the united kingdom  and most of our operating expenses are incurred in british pounds 
our revenues  however  are generally denominated in us dollars  and to a lesser extent in euros  and we report our financial results in us dollars 
accordingly  if the british pound increases in value against the us dollar  our expenses as a percentage of revenues will increase and gross margins and net income will be negatively affected 
our competitors have greater financial resources and greater name recognition than we do and therefore may compete more successfully 
we face competition or potential competition from many companies with greater resources than ours 
if we are unable to compete effectively with these companies  our market share may decline and our business could be harmed 
virtually all of our primary competitors in the silicon based semiconductor equipment market are substantially larger companies and some of them have broader product lines than ours 
they have well established reputations in the markets in which we compete  greater experience with high volume manufacturing  broader name recognition  substantially larger customer bases  and substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than we do 
the dominant silicon based semiconductor equipment manufacturers may determine to enter  or attempt to increase their market share  in the compound semiconductor equipment market 
in each market  we also face potential competition from new entrants  including established manufacturers in other segments of the semiconductor capital equipment market who may decide to diversify into our market segments of cvd  pvd and plasma etch 
semiconductor manufacturers are loyal to their current semiconductor equipment supplier  which may make it difficult for us to obtain new customers 
we believe that once a semiconductor manufacturer has selected a supplier s equipment for a particular fabrication line  the manufacturer often will continue to rely on that supplier s equipment for future requirements  including new generations of similar products 
if we are unable to sell our products to potential customers who currently are using other suppliers equipment  it could be difficult for us to increase our revenues or market share 
changing from one equipment supplier to another may be expensive and may require a substantial investment of resources by the customer 
accordingly  we may experience difficulty in achieving significant sales to a customer using another supplier s equipment 
at the same time  however  we cannot assure you that our existing customers will continue to use our equipment in the future 

back to index our products generally have long sales cycles and implementation periods  which increase our costs of obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our products are technologically complex 
prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and to install and integrate them into larger systems 
in addition  customers often require a significant number of product presentations and demonstrations  in some instances evaluating equipment on site  before reaching a sufficient level of confidence in the product s performance and compatibility with their requirements to place an order 
as a result  our sales process is often subject to delays associated with lengthy approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new products 
the sales cycles of our products often last for many months or even years 
longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources in attempting to make sales and delay the generation of revenue 
in addition  we may incur significant costs in supporting evaluation equipment at our customers facilities 
long sales cycles also subject us to other risks  including customers budgetary constraints  internal acceptance reviews and cancellations 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
the time required for our customers to incorporate our products into their manufacturing processes can vary significantly with the needs of our customers and generally exceeds several months  which further complicates our planning processes and reduces the predictability of our operating results 
we depend upon sole suppliers for certain key components 
we depend on a number of sole suppliers for key components used in the manufacture of our products 
if we are unable to obtain timely delivery of sufficient quantities of these components  we would be unable to manufacture our products to meet customer demand  unless we are able to locate replacement components 
most significantly  our sigma fxp  planar fxp and omega fxp systems are designed around an automation module supplied by brooks automation 
due to the high cost of these modules we keep very few in inventory 
if brooks automation fails to deliver the component on a timely basis  delivery of our sigma fxp  planar fxp and omega fxp systems will be delayed and sales may be lost 
if brooks automation is unable to deliver any such modules for a prolonged period of time  we will have to redesign our sigma fxp and planar fxp systems so that we may utilize other wafer transport systems 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so  or that customers will adopt the redesigned systems 
our final assembly and testing is concentrated in one facility 
our final assembly and testing activity is concentrated in our facility in newport  united kingdom 
we have no alternative facilities to allow for continued production if we are required to cease production in our facility  as a result of a fire  natural disaster or otherwise 
in such event  we will be unable to produce any products until the facility is replaced 
any such interruption in our manufacturing schedule could cause us to lose sales and customers 
if we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel  our ability to manage growth will be negatively affected 
our business and future operating results depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  technical  sales and support personnel for our operations on a worldwide basis 
competition for qualified personnel is intense  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
our operations could be negatively affected if we lose key executives or employees or are unable to attract and retain skilled executives and employees as needed 
our ability to compete could be jeopardized if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from challenges by third parties 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  non disclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued on our pending patent applications or that competitors will not be able to ascertain legitimately proprietary information embedded in our products that is not covered by patent or copyright 
in such case  we may be precluded from preventing the competitor from making use of such information 
in addition  should we wish to assert our patent rights against a particular competitor s product  there can be no assurance that any claim in any of our patents will be sufficiently broad nor  if sufficiently broad  any assurance that our patent will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that we will have sufficient resources to prosecute our rights 

back to index claims or litigation regarding intellectual property rights could seriously harm our business or require us to incur significant costs 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states in the semiconductor equipment industry involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future nor that  if such claims are made  we would be able to defend against such claims successfully or  if necessary  obtain licenses on reasonable terms 
any claim that our products infringe proprietary rights of others would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers against the alleged infringement 
these claims and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their outcome  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following lose or forfeit our proprietary rights  stop manufacturing or selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all and may involve significant royalty payments  pay damages  including treble damages and attorney s fees in some circumstances  or redesign those products that use the challenged intellectual property 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
our sales are characterized by low volume sales of high cost systems and we derive a significant percentage of our revenue from sales to a small number of customers 
if we are not able to retain these customers  or if these customers reschedule  reduce or cancel orders  our revenues will be reduced and our financial results will suffer 
to date our product sales in most fiscal years have been highly concentrated with a small number of customers 
we may not be able to retain our key customers or these customers may cancel purchase orders or reschedule or decrease their level of purchases from us 
any substantial decrease or delay in sales to one or more of our key customers could harm our sales and financial results 
there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to purchase systems and technology from us at current levels  or at all 
sales to these large customers have varied significantly from year to year and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these sales also may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
our operations are subject to health and safety and environmental laws that may expose us to liabilities for noncompliance 
we are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  handling  manufacture and disposal of all materials present at  or our output from  our facilities  including the toxic or other hazardous chemical by products of our manufacturing processes 
environmental claims against us or our failure to comply with any present or future regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us  the suspension of production of our products  or the cessation of our operations 
new regulations could require us to purchase costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses 
our failure to control the use or adequately restrict the discharge of hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities  which could negatively affect our earnings and financial position 

back to index any acquisitions we may make could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
from time to time  we may consider investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
while we have no current agreements or specific plans to do so  we may acquire businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to tangible assets and other intangible assets  or incur large and immediate accounting write offs 
our operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs and liabilities for which we are not able to obtain indemnification from the sellers  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organizations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our earnings and cash flow are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
significant factors affecting this risk include our manufacturing  research and development and administrative cost base  which are predominately incurred in british pounds  and product sales outside the united states  which may be expressed in currencies other than the united states dollar 
we constantly monitor currency exchange rates and match currency availability and requirements whenever possible 
we may from time to time enter into forward foreign exchange transactions in order to minimize risk from firm future positions arising from trading 
as at december  and december  we did not have any open forward currency transactions 
based upon budgeted income and expenditures  a hypothetical increase of in the value of the british pound against all other currencies in the year ended december  would have no material effect on revenues  which are primarily expressed in united states dollars and would increase operating costs and reduce cash flow by approximately million 
the same increase in the value of the british pound would increase the value of the net assets of we expressed in united states dollars by approximately million 
we have also received orders for revenue that are denominated in euros  therefore an increase in the value of the euro in relation to the united states dollar would effect the reported value of revenue 
the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different from the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  it is unlikely that all currencies would uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the british pound 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen
