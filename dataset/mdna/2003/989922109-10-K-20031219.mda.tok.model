item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we intend for this discussion and analysis to provide you with information that will assist you in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements as of september  and for the year then ended and the notes accompanying those consolidated financial statements 
compared to our net sales increased in fiscal to a record million  up from million in the prior year  reflecting continued growth of our core m series product as we continue to capture market share and the growing demand for our aed plus automated external defibrillator product 
s omitted hospital market north america   pre hospital market north america   other north america   international market excluding north america   total north american sales increased to million in comparison to million for the same period a year earlier 
net sales to the north american hospital market totaled million  a increase in comparison to million for the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to million of m series cct shipments to the us military for their pmi patient movement item program 
without the us military  our sales in the north american hospital market remained relatively flat year to year 
we believe this was due to the slowdown in the north american economy 
our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased to million  up from million in the previous year 
increases in this market were primarily due to growth in our data management software revenues and growth in sales of our new aed plus product 
our aed plus product has generated approximately million in total sales in its first full year  of which approximately were sold in north america 
this is compared to aed plus sales of million last year  with approximately sold in north america 
this increase reflects the results of the addition of approximately aed plus distributors and manufacturer s representatives in the north american market along with the addition of in house distributor managers and regional managers for this market and the addition to our direct sales force compared to the prior year 
international sales increased to million in comparison to million for the prior year 
this increase reflects continued growth in all of our direct sales organizations and in our international distributor sales  particularly in europe  the middle east and china 
an increase in foreign currency exchange rates contributed approximately million to this increase 
gross margins for fiscal decreased to  from in fiscal the decreased margins are due to sales to the us military and increased sales to the german army  which included volume discounts 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 
compared to the year ended september   selling and marketing expenses increased million or for the year ended september  the increase in selling and marketing expense reflects additional wages and related benefits and travel for expansion of our pad sales force where we have added new regional and distributor managers  our international sales operations where we have added people  our north american pre hospital sales force where we have added people  our expanded us sales management team  our new us training resources  expansion of our tradeshow participation  and increased advertising and other promotional costs 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to from  as we continued to leverage our personnel and our information technology investments 
general and administrative expenses increased million or for the year ended september   compared to the year ended september  the change from the comparable prior period primarily reflects an increase in wages and related benefits for an expanded headcount to support the larger organization  along with an increase in insurance premiums 
research development r d expenses as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 
r d expenses increased million or for the year ended september  compared to the year ended september  our continued investment in research and development reflects significant resources devoted to data management  product variants of the m series and aed plus product lines  continued clinical trials  expansion of our long term technical research efforts  and expansion of other initiatives 
investment and other income increased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous year 
this increase was primarily due to foreign exchange gains offset by lower investment earnings due to lower cash balances invested at lower interest rates over the prior year 
our effective tax rate remained consistent at for the year ended september   as compared to the same period in fiscal  reflecting continued research and development credits for our r d activity  along with foreign earnings taxed at differing rates  and the utilization of foreign loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased from million to million  or approximately  during fiscal our cash and cash equivalents at september  totaled million compared to million at september  we had short term investments amounting to million at september  in comparison to million at september  cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  increased million to million as compared to million for the year ended september  this net increase was primarily attributable to a rise in our net income year to year combined with a lower growth of our inventory and accounts receivable balances in compared to we also saw an increase in our depreciation expense in compared to  which did not affect cash flow 
this depreciation increase was due to prior years increases in the deployment of demonstration units to our growing sales force along with the deployment of laptop computers to our north american sales force with the implementation of our crm customer relationship management tool 
another factor contributing to this rise in cash from operations was the timing of our fiscal year end on september  which caused our accounts payable and accrued expenses to increase as payroll  rent  corporate taxes and other vendor payments are not typically paid until the calendar month end 
cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal in comparison to million for fiscal this increase primarily reflects the fact that we used million of cash in for net purchases of marketable securities compared to the prior year when we received million of cash on the net sales of marketable securities 
cash was also used to purchase million of equity and debt investments in revivant corporation  lifecor  inc  advanced circulatory systems  inc 
formerly resqsystems  inc  and aed home 
property  plant and equipment purchases increased million from the prior year which was primarily due to additional leasehold improvements for our new facility in chelmsford  massachusetts 
most of these leasehold improvements have been reimbursed to us by our landlord and will be accounted for as credits to rent expense over the life of our lease 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal in comparison to  in the previous year 
the change reflects a higher number of stock options exercised during the current year  in verses  in at a lower average price in verses in 
we maintain a working capital line of credit with our bank 
borrowings under this line bear interest at the bank s base rate at september  
the full amount of the million line was available to us at september we believe that the combination of existing cash  cash equivalents  and highly liquid short term investments on hand  future cash to be generated by operations and amounts available under our existing line of credit will be sufficient to meet our ongoing operating and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements other than non cancelable operating leases entered into in the ordinary course of business 
for liquidity purposes  we choose to lease our facilities and automobiles instead of purchasing them 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables set forth certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts  such as debt and lease agreements  and under contingent commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations in s total less than year years years after years non cancelable operating lease obligations     purchase obligations total contractual obligations      legal and regulatory affairs on november   we announced the settlement of a lawsuit that cardiac science  inc initiated against us in march asserting that we have infringed upon two patents owned by them 
the settlement included the cross licensing of a number of patents 
we paid an initial licensing fee and will pay certain ongoing royalties to them 
these amounts did not and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we are also involved in the normal course of our business in various litigation matters and regulatory issues  including product recalls 
although we are unable to quantify at the present time the exact financial impact in any pending matters  we believe that none of the pending matters will have an outcome material to our financial condition or results of operations 
compared to our net sales increased in fiscal to a record million  up from million in the prior year  reflecting continued growth of our core m series product  and the successful introduction to the market of our cct and aed plus products 
net sales to the north american hospital market totaled million  a increase in comparison to million for the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to our ability to capture market share from our competitors and to a growing acceptance of and desire for more fully featured units which include more monitoring parameters 
our sales to the north american pre hospital market increased to million  up from million in the previous year 
increases in this segment were primarily due to our data management software revenues and distributor sales of our new aed plus product 
total north american sales increased to million in comparison to million for the same period a year earlier 
in addition to the individual factors described above  the following factors have contributed to the overall growth in our north american sales first  there was an increased demand for our biphasic technology and as a result of all m series sold during the have incorporated our biphasic technology compared with in  second  the introduction of our new aed plus product generated approximately million in sales in its initial year  of which approximately were sold in north america 
international sales increased to million in comparison to million for the same period a year earlier 
the increase in international sales reflected continued growth particularly in continental europe  the united kingdom  and australia 
this was the result of continued investments in our international infrastructure  a full year s sales from our direct operations in france and australia  increased sales through our european distribution partners  and record sales in the united kingdom  which included large sales to the uk government  which was upgrading its ems systems 
gross margins for fiscal increased to  from in fiscal the increased margins were due to the introduction of our new cct product  higher demand for monitoring parameters  and contribution from our data management software products 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in international shipments  including sales to distributors  which typically carry lower than average gross margins 
selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales remained consistent at 
compared to the year ended september   selling and marketing expenses increased million or for the year ended september  the increase in selling and marketing expense reflected additions to the north american pre hospital sales force  expenses related to our newest direct distribution subsidiaries in france and australia  and higher marketing costs related to increased personnel and related activities in the international markets and supporting the launch of our aed plus product worldwide

investment and other income decreased to million in fiscal  as compared to million in the previous year 
this decrease was primarily due to declining interest rates  which were slightly offset by the increase in average cash balances over the prior year 
our effective tax rate decreased from to for the year ended september   as compared to the same period in fiscal  reflecting increased research and development credits stemming from the development of our cct and aed plus products 
critical accounting policies our management strives to report our financial results in a clear and understandable manner  even though in some cases accounting and disclosure rules are complex and require us to use technical terminology 
we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these principles require us to make certain estimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
management continually reviews its accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
following is a summary of our more significant accounting policies  defined as revenue recognition and those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions  and how they are applied in preparation of the financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note a in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from sales of cardiac resuscitation devices  disposable electrodes and accessories are recognized when a signed non cancelable purchase order exists  the product is shipped  title and risk have passed to the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns 
we also license software under non cancelable license agreements and provide services including training  installation  consulting and maintenance  which consist of product support services  periodic updates and unspecified upgrade rights collectively  post contract customer support pcs 
revenue from the sale of software is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
license fee revenues are recognized when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed  the software product has been shipped  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues from maintenance agreements and upgrade rights are recognized ratably over the period of service 
our software arrangements contain multiple elements  which include software products  services and pcs 
in general  we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for our software products 
accordingly  for transactions where vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements but not for delivered elements  we use the residual method as discussed in sop  modification of sop  with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
allowance for doubtful accounts sales returns and allowances we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses  which are included in bad debt expense  resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  credit history and current economic condition 
we also maintain an estimate of potential future product returns and discounts given related to trade ins and to current period product receivables 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which are included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
as of september  our accounts receivable balance of million is reported net of allowances of million 
we believe our reported allowances at september  are adequate 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  however  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances  resulting in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
warranty reserves our products are sold with warranty provisions that require us to remedy deficiencies in quality or performance over a specified period of time  usually one to five years 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we believe that our recorded liability of million at september  is adequate to cover future costs for the servicing of our products sold through that date 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory reserves significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand either because the product is outdated  obsolete  or because the amount on hand is in excess of future needs 
we provide for the total value of inventories that we determine to be obsolete based on criteria such as customer demand and changing technologies 
at september   our inventory reserves were million  or of our million gross inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
safe harbor statements certain statements contained herein constitute forward looking statements as that term is defined under the private securities litigation reform act of the act and releases issued by the securities and exchange commission and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the exchange act of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate and other expressions which are predictions of or indicate future events and trends and which do not relate to historical matters identify forward looking statements 
particularly  the company s expectations regarding future operational liquidity  contractual obligations and other commercial commitments  and capital requirements are forward looking statements 
reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  the length and severity of the current economic slowdown and its impact on capital spending budgets  the potential disruption in the transportation industry on the company s supply chain and product distribution channels and those other risks and uncertainties contained under the heading risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have cash equivalents and marketable securities that primarily consist of money market accounts and fixed rate asset backed corporate securities 
the majority of these investments have maturities within one to five years 
we believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is minimal due to the term and type of our investments and that fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have international offices in canada  united kingdom  netherlands  france  germany  and australia 
these subsidiaries transact business in their functional or local currency 
therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks and fluctuations in foreign currencies  along with economic and political instability in the foreign countries in which we operate  all of which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we use forward contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates underlying the value of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
a forward contract obligates us to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified exchange rates on specified dates 
these forward contracts are denominated in the same currency in which the underlying foreign currency receivables are denominated and bear a contract value and maturity date that approximate the value and expected settlement date  respectively  of the underlying transactions 
unrealized gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period  resulting from changes in the fair value of these contracts  are recognized in earnings generally in the same period as exchange gains and losses on the underlying foreign denominated receivables are recognized 
gains and losses on forward contracts and foreign denominated receivables are included in investment and other income 
we had one forward exchange contract outstanding in the notional amount of million euros at september  the contract serves as a hedge of a substantial portion of our euro denominated intercompany balances 
the fair value of the foreign currency derivative contract outstanding at september  was approximately million 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of the euro derivative foreign exchange contract outstanding at september  indicates that  if the us dollar weakened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would decrease by  conversely  if the us dollar strengthened by against the euro  the fair value of this contract would increase by  any gains and losses on the fair value of the derivative contract would be largely offset by losses and gains on the underlying transaction 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the analysis above 
exchange rate sensitivity september  expected maturity dates amounts in thereafter total unrealized gain loss forward exchange agreements receive pay euro contract amount  average contract exchange rate
