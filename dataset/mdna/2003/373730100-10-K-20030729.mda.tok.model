item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview global economic conditions and weak demand for our capital equipment products adversely affected each of our three operating segments in fiscal and are expected to affect our operating results in fiscal despite these conditions  sales of aftermarket supplies  which consist primarily of consumable and spare parts and service revenues  continued to be steady in fiscal and partially offset the impact of the lower capital equipment sales 
equipment and aftermarket supplies and service revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year are reflected in the table below percent of total revenues fiscal fiscal equipment aftermarket supplies services in light of the challenging market conditions and in accordance with our turnaround plan  management is focused on continuous high quality new product development  global expansion  and cost cutting measures 
the company s legacy has historically been new product development and we expect this will continue as we endeavor to fulfill the rapidly advancing technological capital equipment market needs of our customers 
we intend to continue to reach out to potential new markets and reinforce our presence in our existing markets 
we continued our focus on cost cutting measures during fiscal to improve future operating results and effectively manage the business 
we implemented our shared services initiative  starting with gerber technology gt and gerber scientific products gsp  to optimize our supply chain and improve the efficiency of our support operations 
this initiative encompasses strategic purchasing  inventory management  freight and logistics costs  as well as factory integration  enterprise resources planning erp system consolidations  and facility consolidations 
we also began implementing european warehouse consolidations in fiscal in our sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
these activities are expected to result in efficiency improvements  economies of scale  and provide for improved customer satisfaction with product delivery and quality 
we intend to implement further cost reductions by including gerber coburn gc in the shared services initiative and implement ing additional warehouse consolidations 
these initiatives will result in further restructuring charges related to employee separations and relocations  facility consolidations  and contract terminations 
when completed  these combined activities are expected to result in approximately million in annual cost reductions 
there is no guarantee that the above described components of our turnaround plan will yield the results management expects 
there are risks involved with new product development  continued global expansion  and cost cutting measures 
these measures may raise product costs  delay product production and service delivery  result in strained relations with our employees or customers  or create inefficiencies in the business 
further  they could give rise to unforeseen costs  which could wholly or partially offset any expected expense reductions or other financial benefits 
we continue not to anticipate meaningful improvement in the current economic outlook and demand for our capital equipment products  particularly in the markets served by our apparel and flexible materials and sign making and specialty graphics business segments 
additionally  fiscal benefited from incremental capital equipment sales to ophthalmic lens processing customers that are not likely to be repeated in fiscal given these expectations  our cost reduction initiatives are of critical importance 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues increased million percent to million in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  foreign currency translation had a favorable impact on our consolidated results due primarily to the strengthening of the euro and pound sterling in relation to the us dollar 
holding foreign currency constant at last year s rates  consolidated revenues were million percent lower than in the prior fiscal year 
the table below reflects the percentage decrease in revenues for fiscal year holding exchange rates consistent at the levels compared to the prior year for the company on a consolidated basis and for the two segments whose revenues were materially affected by currency effects 
revenues fiscal vs 
consolidated sign making specialty graphics apparel flexible materials foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on the ophthalmic lens processing segment s revenues 
overall  the geographic distribution of the company s business was similar to a year ago  north america and europe each represented approximately percent of our consolidated revenues  with the rest of the world accounting for the remainder 
weak global economic conditions continued to negatively affect demand for the sign making and specialty graphics segment s products in fiscal market conditions resulted in shrinking advertising budgets  which put pressure on the segment s sign and screen printing shops  graphic arts professionals  and other customers 
this contributed to the relatively weak demand for the segment s capital equipment products  particularly in north america  where the overall us sign market had flat sales versus a predicted growth of percent 
the downward trend in the segment s sales of legacy plotters and routers continued in fiscal and is expected to continue in fiscal year the sign making and specialty graphics segment s equipment sales were also affected by the accelerated rate of the transition from thermal imaging to inkjet imaging systems in fiscal this was the result of economic pressure on end use output costs and the greater flexibility of inkjet imaging systems 
notwithstanding this continuing trend  segment management believes that end use customers will continue to require both inkjet and thermal systems to serve the wide range of sign applications 
in recent years  aftermarket supplies have represented the source of approximately percent of the sign making and specialty graphics segment s revenues 
in fiscal year  this segment experienced a reduction in revenues from the sale of thermal imaging foils compared to the prior year  which was attributable to the transition from thermal imaging to inkjet imaging systems and the weak economic conditions 
this segment also experienced a decline in revenues from the sale of cast vinyl materials in fiscal year over the last few years  the quality of calendered vinyl materials has improved  although price levels have not increased 
with the reduction in the quality gap between such materials and higher performance cast vinyl materials  demand for cast vinyls may not return to prior levels 
the weak economic conditions also adversely affected demand for the apparel and flexible materials segment s capital equipment products in fiscal this led to weak worldwide spending on capital equipment due to lower us apparel demand  which resulted in reduced export sales from garment making countries 
in fiscal  the apparel and flexible materials segment continued to be affected by the migration of apparel and furniture production from the united states and europe to lower cost markets  primarily in the far east and eastern europe  where the adoption of factory automation is nascent 
however  the apparel and flexible materials segment experienced increased business volume outside of the us and europe in fiscal  primarily the result of its increasing presence in asia  which is allowing the segment to better serve growing asian markets 
the apparel and flexible materials segment s aftermarket revenues  consisting of customer service  training and consulting  and parts sales  increased in absolute terms and as a percentage of total segment revenues in fiscal compared to the prior year 
revenues were higher in the ophthalmic lens processing segment due primarily to incremental lens finishing equipment sales to large retail and discount eyewear chains 
this offset the effect of lower industry prescription volumes for spectacle lens eyewear  particularly at the wholesale lab level and  to a lesser extent  independent eye care practitioners 
this negatively affected both sales of the segment s capital equipment products  primarily surfacing equipment  and aftermarket products 
the ophthalmic lens processing segment intends to continue to focus on addressing the business needs of the large  high volume labs 
as the market continues to shift to more sophisticated lens materials  which favor this segment s product offerings  plans to enhance its presence in the growing asian markets will continue 
gross profit margins 
the overall gross profit margin in fiscal was percent compared with percent for the prior year 
margins on both product sales and service revenue were higher 
however  excluding a million write down of inventory in the sign making and specialty graphics segment that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the prior year gross margin was percent  meaning that our overall gross margin actually decreased slightly in fiscal decreases in the product gross margin occurred largely in the sign making and specialty graphics segment due to the lower revenue noted above  an unfavorable sales mix specifically  a shift from higher margin thermal digital imaging systems to lower priced  lower margin inkjet imaging systems that are distributed on an oem basis  price discounting  losses on settlements of forward exchange contracts  and unfavorable factory overhead absorption due to the lower business volume 
the sign making and specialty graphics segment intends to develop lower cost  innovative equipment and to lower its product cost structure to reverse the declining trend in its revenue and margins 
lowering its product cost structure will entail research and development advances  continued involvement in the shared services initiative  continued implementation of the sap enterprise resource planning system throughout our subsidiaries  and continued warehouse facility consolidations 
product margins were also lower in the apparel and flexible materials segment 
this was due primarily to pricing pressure  a shift in the product mix toward multi ply cutting equipment vs 
higher margin single ply cutting equipment  losses on the settlement of forward exchange contracts  and a shift in the geographic mix of sales to international markets where the segment often sells through its external distribution channel 
these unfavorable factors were partially offset by lower factory costs resulting from restructuring initiatives implemented in fiscal gross margin increases occurred in the ophthalmic lens processing segment  which was due primarily to the higher revenue 
this was partially offset by an unfavorable product mix favoring lower margin lens finishing equipment products  which are distributed on an oem basis  and the unfavorable absorption of factory overhead costs due to lower volume of manufactured equipment 
this segment plans to lower its cost structure through research and development advances  participating in the shared services initiative  and implementing the sap enterprise resource planning system 
the higher service margins in fiscal resulted from lower costs associated with the fiscal and restructuring initiatives  principally in the apparel and flexible materials segment 
selling  general  administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were percent of revenue in fiscal  which is lower than the prior year percentage of percent 
cost reductions from prior year restructuring initiatives offset incremental legal and other professional services costs of approximately million in fiscal associated with the ongoing investigation by the sec s division of enforcement 
research and development r d expense in fiscal was million compared to million in the prior year 
r d expense was percent of revenue in fiscal  compared with percent in the prior year 
the relatively steady level of r d spending reflects our continuing commitment to new product development 
restructuring charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million associated with the implementation of the shared services initiative between gerber technology and gerber scientific products  and the consolidation of spandex warehouses in france and germany 
of this amount  million related to employee severance charges for the elimination of redundant positions and million related to the net present value of expected future lease costs at the cease use date of a dormant facility 
charges associated with the operating segments were apparel and flexible materials  million and sign making and specialty graphics  million 
the fiscal restructuring is expected to result in approximately million in operating efficiency improvements in fiscal  primarily through decreases in cost of sales and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
both of these restructuring plans were completed by april  in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million associated with ongoing efforts to reduce costs 
charges associated with operating segments and corporate headquarters were apparel and flexible materials  million  sign making and specialty graphics  million  ophthalmic lens processing  million  and corporate headquarters  million 
the corporate level charges  as well as those of certain operating segments  were coincident with a decision to pursue a corporate shared services model for our operating units 
the table below details the restructuring accruals by fiscal year from april  to april  in thousands april  accrual utilization reversal april  fiscal fiscal fiscal accruals in fiscal year were for severance costs related to employee separations and facility consolidation costs 
the remaining fiscal restructuring plan accrual as of april  represents severance and other amounts payable to our former chief executive officer 
in fiscal  we incurred cash outflows related to the fiscal   and plans of million  million  and million  respectively  which were funded by cash generated from operations 
the remaining fiscal plan utilization of million consisted of non cash charges 
we anticipate future cash payments of million  million  and million during fiscal   and  respectively 
the reversals of previously established restructuring reserves of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as restructuring charges  which is where the accruals were originally recorded 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for further discussion of the restructuring charges 
write down of assets 
during fiscal  we recorded an asset impairment charge of million relating to the relocation of certain manufacturing operations to tolland  ct from marblehead  ma 
these impairments resulted from the disposal of all building and leasehold improvements at the marblehead facility 
in fiscal  we recorded losses of million to reflect write downs of buildings classified as net assets held for sale 
fiscal write downs represented a million pre tax loss relating to the apparel and flexible materials operating segment and a million pre tax loss relating to an unoccupied building not associated with an operating segment 
other income expense 
fiscal included realized and unrealized foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million compared to losses of million in the prior year comparable period 
also  in fiscal and  we recognized million and million in impairment losses  respectively  on a promissory note as it became probable that we were not going to be able to collect the amounts due according to the contractual terms of the note 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for further discussion of this impairment charge 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal of million was million lower than the prior year due to both lower average debt balances and lower interest rates 
the lower average debt balances were the result of cash provided by operations  sale and leaseback transactions in fiscal  the sale of a discontinued operation  and other asset sales  all of which reduced borrowings under the company s then primary credit facility 
the lower interest rate reflected the reduction in libor over the past year and the favorable impact of our lower leverage ratio 
this translated into a lower interest rate under the terms of that credit facility  which was paid off in full in may income tax expense 
the rate for taxes on income from continuing operations in fiscal was percent compared with a benefit of percent in the prior year 
compared to the us statutory rate of percent  the lower fiscal effective tax rate was the result of tax benefits associated with foreign sales  r d tax credits  and tax planning strategies involving our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
discontinued operation 
on july   we completed the sale of stereo optical company  inc stereo optical  which was included in the ophthalmic lens processing operating segment  for million in cash less an amount held in escrow for purchase price adjustments  the majority of which has been collected 
stereo optical was accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning with the fiscal consolidated financial statements 
this accounting recognition was required by our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly  the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended april  has been reclassified to reflect the effects of the discontinued operation 
the gain on disposition was million before taxes and million after taxes  or 
per diluted share 
stereo optical s revenue and pre tax income reported in discontinued operations were million and million  respectively  for the year ended april  and million and million  respectively  for the year ended april  cumulative effect of accounting change 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  adoption of this accounting principle resulted in a write off of million in fiscal net earnings loss 
as a result of the above  net earnings in fiscal were million per diluted share compared to a net loss of million per diluted share in the prior year 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues 
consolidated revenues decreased million percent in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease reflected both lower product sales and service revenue and reflected weaker foreign currency translation rates  which lowered revenue approximately million primarily in the sign making and specialty graphics and apparel and flexible materials operating segments 
revenues in the sign making and specialty graphics segment in fiscal were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in the apparel and flexible materials segment  fiscal revenues were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in the ophthalmic lens processing segment  revenues were million  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
capital spending in the sign making  apparel  and ophthalmic industries diminished 
aftermarket supplies revenues were lower than the prior year  but the economic weakness continued to have a more profound impact on equipment sales 
as was the case in fiscal  this impact was most notable in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
this segment s business was and continues to be affected by a migration of apparel production from north american and european markets to lower labor cost markets 
the adoption of factory automation in these lower cost markets lagged the migration impact 
the lower equipment sales in the sign making and specialty graphics segment was due largely to weakening market conditions in european markets  particularly the united kingdom and germany 
aftermarket supplies revenues were lower primarily in the sign making and specialty graphics and ophthalmic lens processing operating segments 
the sign making and specialty graphics segment s reduction was caused by customer migration from the company s proprietary vinyl material products to lower cost commodity like products 
the ophthalmic lens processing segment s reduction was commensurate with lower industry prescription volumes 
service revenue in fiscal was down about percent from the decrease occurred in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment due to loss of service business in north america coincident with migration of the apparel industry to offshore locales 
weaker foreign currency translation rates lowered revenue approximately million in fiscal  which affected primarily the sign making and specialty graphics million and apparel and flexible materials million operating segments 
the downturn of the us economy  which began late in the third quarter of fiscal  continued throughout fiscal this was exacerbated by non us economic performance following the non us lead early in as a result  the company s order entry and backlog levels approached historic lows  and each of our operating segments reported lower revenue and order entry levels for the full year 
in response to the declining revenues  management continued to take steps to reduce our cost structure 
those initiatives resulted in pre tax charges of million related to actions to reduce overall headcount by approximately employees in the third quarter 
these charges were coincident with a decision to pursue a corporate shared services model for our operating units 
on a geographic basis  fiscal sales to us customers were million lower  to european customers  million lower  and to all other customers  million lower than in the prior year 
the us sales decline occurred almost entirely in the apparel and flexible materials operating segment 
this decline was mitigated by a stabilization of demand later in fiscal for both the apparel and flexible materials and ophthalmic lens processing segments products 
us sales in the ophthalmic lens processing segment were higher than in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to equipment shipments to large us discount chains later in fiscal sales declines outside of us markets occurred in each operating segment and were the result of worsening global economic conditions 
the largest declines were in non european international markets 
these markets particularly china  japan  australia  and turkey were negatively affected by the follow on effect of the north american capital equipment market weakness  currency crises in south american and asian markets  and increased competition 
gross profit margins 
the overall gross profit margin in fiscal was percent  which was higher than the prior year margin of percent 
margins on product sales were lower but were higher on service revenue 
the decrease in the product gross profit margin was the result of lower product sales  competitive pricing effects  and unfavorable business mix 
from a business mix perspective  lower equipment sales continued to impact profitability and caused lower margin aftermarket supplies revenue to represent a higher proportion of total product sales 
equipment sales hardware and software were percent of total sales in fiscal compared with percent in the prior fiscal year 
additionally  the company lowered certain equipment product prices in the sign making and specialty graphics segment s european business in an effort to maintain market position 
these negative margin effects were more than entirely offset by aggressive cost reductions and prod uctivity improvements 
see the discussion below under restructuring and other charges and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
service gross margins in fiscal also benefited 
the company expects to further improve its gross margin with implementation of productivity and shared service initiatives 
weaker foreign currency translation rates lowered the overall gross margin approximately million in fiscal selling  general  administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses were percent of revenue in fiscal  down from percent in fiscal cost reductions were responsible for most of this improvement  offset by higher warranty and other costs related to gsp s maxx thermal imaging system  fourth quarter charges associated with an internal review at spandex  and higher corporate charges 
research and development expenses 
our r d expenses for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal r d expenses were percent and percent of revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
fourth quarter charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded pre tax charges of million in the sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
production delays and technical difficulties associated with digital imaging products represented million of the charges and reflected inventory write downs caused by market introductions of competing products at selling prices lower than our carrying cost 
the charges also reflected obligations associated with upgrades for units already sold and the return of some units 
of the aggregate charge of million  approximately million was included in cost of sales as an inventory write down  primarily due to changing market conditions and production delays associated with gsp s maxx thermal digital imaging system  and million in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the remaining million of charges related to asset write downs  contractual obligations  and employee costs associated w ith the spandex business included in our sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
goodwill amortization and impairment 
on may   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and ceased amortizing goodwill  which reduced amortization expense 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  adoption of the accounting principle resulted in a write off of approximately million in restructuring and other charges 
as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million in fiscal associated with ongoing efforts to reduce costs 
these charges were recorded in each of our operating segments  including corporate headquarters 
the corporate level charges and certain operating segment charges were coincident with our decision to pursue a corporate shared services model for our operating units 
this change was designed to increase ownership of corporate staff functions at business units and  through shared services initiatives  realize cost savings through supply chain consolidation and other benefits 
the restructuring charge was comprised entirely of severance and related employment termination costs associated with workforce reductions of salaried and hourly employees 
the charge was funded by cash generated from operations and borrowings under our then primary credit facility 
as of april   this restructuring program was completed 
interest expense 
interest expense in fiscal of million was million lower than fiscal  primarily due to lower average debt levels 
substantially all borrowings were against our then primary credit facility 
the interest rate on these borrowings was based on libor for the relevant currency and term plus a margin based on the relationship of our consolidated total debt to ebitda over the trailing four quarters 
increases in the interest rate margin and fees associated with amendments to this credit facility were significant offsets to reductions in libor during the year and the impact of our improved ebitda 
these increases almost completely offset the benefits of the lower debt levels on interest expense for the year 
discontinued operations 
on july   we completed the sale of stereo optical company  inc stereo optical  which was included in the ophthalmic lens processing operating segment  for million in cash less an amount held in escrow for purchase price adjustments  the majority of which has been collected 
stereo optical was accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning with the fiscal consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april  and were reclassified to reflect the effects of a discontinued operation 
this accounting recognition was required by our adoption of sfas no 
stereo optical s revenue and pre tax income reported in discontinued operations were million and million  respectively  in fiscal and million and million  respectively  in fiscal financial condition liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating and investing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  adequacy of available bank lines of credit  and the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
our short term liquidity at april  was adequate for our requirements and we expect that available cash and our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to meet normal operating requirements over the foreseeable future 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within the foreseeable future 
further  the impact on our cash flow could be significant if we are unable at any time to meet required covenants in the agreements memorializing our new credit facilities  which were entered into on may  this might be caused by a continued deterioration in worldwide ec onomic conditions that would further affect demand for our products  additional charges that may be required because of weak economic conditions  market changes  and delayed product introductions  and our ability to complete our ongoing efforts to improve operational efficiencies 
accordingly  additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all  and may be dilutive to then current shareholders 
our debt was primarily classified as long term at april  due to the refinancing that occurred on may   except for million that was refinanced with revolver borrowings under the new senior facility 
this amount was classified as short term  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  because the new revolving credit facility agreement contains both a lock box arrangement and certain subjective acceleration clauses 
financial condition 
the ratio of our current assets to current liabilities was to at april  and to at april  net working capital at april  was million  an increase of million from the beginning of the fiscal year 
the increase in working capital and the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was primarily due to the classification as a noncurrent liability of the portion of indebtedness under our former multi currency revolving credit facility that was refinanced with four year term loan borrowings on may  this was offset by the sales of three properties held for sale as of april   reductions in the current portion of deferred income taxes that became deductible for income tax purposes during the year  and lower working capital resulting from our efforts to generate cash and reduce debt 
in particular  inventory balances were significantly reduced  which reflected our progress in executing against o ur supply chain optimization initiatives and implementation of lean manufacturing techniques 
net working capital included million of assets held for sale at april  in the first six months of fiscal  we completed the sale of three properties previously included in our consolidated balance sheets as net assets held for sale for combined net proceeds of million  which approximated net book value 
cash flows 
for the year ended april   operations provided million of cash  compared with million in the prior year 
after adjusting for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  a gain in fiscal on the sale of a discontinued operation  and the effect of the prior year goodwill  restructuring  and asset impairment charges  cash earnings in fiscal were higher than the prior year 
however  the majority of the increase in cash flow from operations was due to working capital improvements 
although we collected less cash from our customers in fiscal because of the lower volume of business  lower inventory balances  and the refund of taxes paid in prior years more than offset this effect 
the lower inventory balances reflected progress in executing against our supply chain optimization initiatives and implementation of lean manufacturing techniques 
cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  reflecting primarily the proceeds from sales of assets previously held for sale of million and from the sale of a discontinued operation of million 
these proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under our former multi currency revolving credit facility 
this compares to a source of cash totaling million in fiscal resulting primarily from the sale and leaseback of three facilities  including our headquarters in south windsor  ct 
capital expenditures in fiscal totaled million  a decline of million from capital outlays in the year ago period 
we anticipate paying approximately million for capital expenditures in fiscal due in part to anticipated expenditures associated with further implementation of our enterprise resource planning system in accordance with our shared services and warehouse consolidation initiatives 
funding for these capital expenditures is expecte d to come from our new senior revolving credit facility 
cash used for financing activities of million in fiscal was primarily for net repayments of borrowings under our former multi currency revolving credit facility 
cash was also used in fiscal as consideration for amendments to the agreement memorializing the terms of this credit facility  as well as initial payments associated with the refinancing of that facility 
at april   we had credit commitments from banks totaling million under our former multi currency revolving credit facility 
at april   borrowings under that facility amounted to million 
our total debt at april  was million  down million from the april  balance of million 
net debt total debt less cash and short term cash investments was million at april   compared with million at april  and the ratio of net debt to total capital net debt plus equity reduced to percent at april  from percent at april  due primarily to net principal repayments of million during fiscal net debt and the ratio of net debt to total capital are used by management to assess our liquidity 
credit facilities 
our former credit facility at april  required us to maintain certain financial covenants 
at april   we were in compliance with the covenants 
shortly after the fiscal year end  this credit facility was repaid in full 
on may   we entered into a four year million senior credit facility arranged by fleet securities  inc the financing consisted of a million asset based  multi currency revolving credit facility the revolver led by fleet capital corporation  and two term loan facilities  each in the amount of million the term a loan and term b loan and collectively  the term loans  led by ableco finance llc  a fund affiliated with cerberus capital management  lp the revolver and term loans being collectively referred to as the credit facilities 
the terms of the agreements memorializing the credit facilities enabled us to meet our primary objectives by refinancing our debt without shareholder dilution and prepayment penalties after the first year and to provide us with the liquidity and flexibility needed to support our ongoing turnaround efforts 
the lenders under these arrangements have been granted security interests in selected assets of the company and its subsidiaries including certain real estate and leasehold interests in the us and elsewhere  inventory and accounts receivable in the us  canada  us  germany  and the netherlands  intangible assets  intellectual property  and other assets 
the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants as defined in the revolver agreement including certain fixed charge coverage ratios  total liabilities to tangible capital base ratios  and consolidated ebitda as defined as well as limitations on capital expenditures 
the agreement also includes limitations on additional indebtedness and liens  contingent liabilities  asset sales and dividends  investments and hedging activities  transactions with affiliates  legal entity changes  and other customary covenants and representations 
additionally  the company is required to maintain certain financial covenants as defined in the term loans agreement including maintenance of certain leverage ratios  fixed charge coverage ratios  and consolidated ebitda as defined levels  as well as limitations on capital expenditures 
the agreement also includes limitations on additional indebtedness and liens  contingent liabilities  asset sales  dividends  issuance of capital stock  investments and hedging activities  transactions with affiliates  and other customary covenants and representations 
the term loans do not have scheduled principal repayments until the maturity ie  at the end of four years 
although we believe we will be in compliance with the financial covenants under our credit facilities  we may not be able to satisfy these covenants because our financial performance may be impacted by various economic  financial  and industry factors 
noncompliance with these covenants would constitute an event of default  allowing the lenders to accelerate the repayment of any borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities 
we believe we would be able to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers if an event of default were imminent  however  we might be required to provide additional collateral to the lenders or make other financial concessions  including those that may be dilutive to existing shareholders 
furthermore  our operating results and financial condition might be adversely affected if we were unable to successfully negotiate amended covenants or obtain waivers on acceptable terms 
at april  and  our long term debt also included tax exempt industrial revenue bonds amounting to million 
the weighted average interest rate on this debt was percent at april  and percent at april  pension obligations 
the funded status of the company s pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
recent declines in the value of securities traded in equity markets coupled with declines in long term interest rates have had a negative impact on the funded status of the plans 
as a result  we lowered the pension obligation discount rate and the expected return on plan assets of the plans in fiscal to percent and percent  respectively  as compared to percent and percent in fiscal upon final measurement using these adjusted economic assumptions  we recognized a minimum pension liability through a non cash after tax reduction to shareholders equity of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal although we do not expect to be required to make cash contributions to the defined benefit plans in the fiscal year  pension expense is expected to be higher beca use of the economic assumption changes discussed above 
contractual cash obligations and commitments at april   we had the following contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments in thousands total less than year years years thereafter long term debt operating leases inventory purchase obligations total existing and potential claims against the company alleging violations of the securities laws  sec enforcement investigation purported class action litigation in mid april  the first of eight putative class action lawsuits were filed against the company and several of our current and former officers in the us district court for the district of connecticut 
the lawsuits alleged  among other things  that the company and the individual defendants knowingly issued false and misleading financial statements and financial information in violation of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of the exchange act 
the first of these lawsuits was filed shortly after we announced that we expected to take a million pre tax charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and that the company was conducting an internal review of its financial reporting for the period of january  through april   a review prompted by a securities and exchange commission investigation of trading in the company s stock and  subsequently  of the company s inventory and reserve accounting practices and related disclosures 
this announcement also indicated that once the internal review was completed  we would likely restate our financial results for the appropriate periods 
at the end of august  we announced that the review of our financial reporting  under the direction of the audit and finance committee of our board  had been completed and that our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended april  filed with the sec included a restatement of prior annual financial statements f or fiscal years and in mid december  the lawsuits  which had been consolidated into a single action by order of the court in mid july  were voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs  with the consent of the defendants  in a filing with the us district court for the district of connecticut 
the dismissal provided that no payments were to be made by any of the parties to the litigation 
further  the dismissal did not constitute any admission by any party with respect to the allegations asserted in the lawsuits 
the dismissal was without prejudice and it is possible these claims could be re filed in the future 
claims which may be asserted under the company s k plan in december  the company registered  shares of the company s common stock to be purchased by an independent trustee in the open market for the benefit and at the direction of company employees pursuant to the gerber scientific  inc and participating subsidiaries k maximum advantage program and trust the plan 
approximately million shares were acquired by plan participants before this option was discontinued on july  the purchase of shares under the plan in excess of the number of shares registered may have been exempt from registration under the securities act of the company understands  however  that the staff of the securities and exchange commission takes the position that one possible exemption  under section a of the securities act  would not apply to shares of an employer sponsored plan acquired in the open market by an independent trustee at the direction and for the benefit of employee participants pursuant to plans of this type ie  plans in which employee contributions can be directed toward the purchase of a company s stock and the company s matching contributions may be less than for 
if the acquisitions of these shares are found not to have been exempt from registration  the company could be liable under section a of the securities act for rescission or damages to the employees who purchased these shares 
under section of the securities act  a rescission right  which is the effective equivalent to a put right  can be maintained to enforce liability under section a at any time within one year after the violation on which it is based but not more than three years after the relevant securities were first offered to the public 
a rescission right would entitle the employee purchasers of these shares to receive the return of the amounts paid for these shares  together with interest from the date of purchase 
the current members of the plan s administrative committee  on the advice of counsel  requested the company to toll effective july   any statutes of limitations with respect to claims which might be made by or on behalf of plan participants alleging that the company should have registered these shares 
the company acceded to this request  and entered into a tolling agreement  which has been extended  most recently to september   to allow the independent fiduciary described below adequate time to study the issue 
the prices paid for shares acquired during the one year prior to july  aggregated approximately million 
the prices paid for all of the unregistered shares that were acquired under the plan aggregated approximately million 
in addition to any claims that may be asserted under the securities act  claims may also be asserted under the employee retirement income security act of for recovery of losses incurred with respect to the purchase of the unregistered shares 
the company does not currently intend to offer rescission to the purchasers of these shares and intends to defend against any claim for either rescission or damages 
however  the possibility of such a claim gives rise to a contingent liability that  if realized  could adversely affect the financial condition of the company 
given the current status of this unasserted claim  the company cannot reasonably estimate a loss 
in july  the company appointed an independent fiduciary under the plan to deal with all matters on behalf of the plan related to the facts described herein and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sec enforcement investigation in september  the division of enforcement of the securities and exchange commission initiated an investigation relating to possible insider trading activity with respect to the company s securities 
in october  the sec expanded its investigation to encompass the company s inventory and reserve accounting practices and related disclosures 
the enforcement staff has since asked for information and documents relating to various accounting and other matters including matters that have been addressed through the restatement of our prior annual financial statements for fiscal years and 
in addition  the staff has taken the testimony of current and former officers and employees of the company 
the company believes that it has cooperated fully with the staff during the course of this investigation 
if the sec s investigation results in any formal adverse findings  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and business could be adversely affected 
the company has incurred  and expects to continue to incur  significant legal and other costs in connection with this investigation 
as the investigation is ongoing  we cannot predict the length nor the potential outcome of the investigation  nor the potential impact on the company 
lease financing arrangements we have agreements with major financial services institutions to provide lease financing to purchasers of our equipment 
these leases typically have terms ranging from years 
the amount of lease receivables financed under these agreements was million and the amount that was subject to recourse provisions was approximately million at april  the equipment sold collateralizes the lease receivables 
in the event of default by the lessee  the company has liability to the financial services institution under recourse provisions but has the right to repossess and resell the equipment  the proceeds from which cover a majority of the liability to the financial services institutions 
as of april   we have recorded a million liability that reflects the undiscounted accrual of the expected losses under the recourse provisions 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
some of those accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continually monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customers inability to make required payments 
we consider various factors including accounts receivable agings  customer credit worthiness  and historical bad debts when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts 
additional allowances may be required if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates and results in their inability to make payments 
as of april  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts was percent and percent of gross accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
doubtful accounts written off in fiscal years   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
inventory inventory is generally stated at the lower of standard cost or market value 
standard cost approximates cost as variances are applied to inventory as appropriate 
inventory at our apparel and flexible materials segment s overseas non manufacturing companies is valued on a weighted average basis  which approximates a first in  first out basis 
we review market value of inventory on an ongoing basis with consideration given to deterioration  obsolescence  excess quantities  and other factors 
during fiscal  we wrote down to management s estimate of market value inventories of digital imaging products relating to our sign making and specialty graphics operating segment 
this was caused by the introduction of competing products at prices less than the carrying cost of our products 
the write downs totaled million 
if actual market conditions for those products or any of our inventories are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write dow ns or adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
there were no significant write downs of inventory required in fiscal as of april   our net inventory balance was million 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review the value of our long lived assets  including goodwill  for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of the assets are no longer appropriate 
during fiscal  we recognized goodwill impairments amounting to million 
of this total  million related to the sign making and specialty graphics segment and million related to the ophthalmic lens processing segment 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units is based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplate other valuation techniques 
during fiscal  we were not required to recognize any additional goodwill impairments 
when testing for impairment of goodwill  we discount estimates of future cash flows using an estimate of the reporting units weighted average cost of capital adjusted to include an appropriate risk premium 
a percent increase in the discount rates used would not have resulted in any further goodwill impairments 
however  if the fair value of the spandex or gerber coburn reporting units decreased by percent in fiscal  we would have recorded additional goodwill impairment charges of approximately million and million  respectively 
a percent decrease in the fair value of our remaining reporting units would not have resulted in any additional goodwill impairments 
as of april   we had million of goodwill and million of net amortizable intangible assets remaining on the balance sheet  which management believes is realizable based on the estimated cash flows of the associated businesses 
however  it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used  such as future sales and expense levels  in assessing that value may need to be re evaluated in the case of continued market deterioration  which could result in further impairment of those assets 
restructuring charges over the last few years  we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives  which required development of formalized plans for separating employees  discontinuing product lines  and consolidating certain facilities 
these plans required management to use estimates related to properties held for sale  which resulted in write downs of those properties 
additionally  we recorded estimated expenses for severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  inventory write downs  long term asset impairments  and other related costs 
given the significance of  and the timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
as of january  and subsequent  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits are used to account for costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring not be recognized until the liability is incurred 
prior to january   the accounting for restructuring costs and asset impairments required us to record provisions and charges when management committed to a formal plan under emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
as management continues to evaluate the reasonableness of the remaining liabilities under the restructuring initiatives  there may be additional charges for new restructuring activities as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded 
warranty a limited warranty is provided on our products for periods ranging from days to one year and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires management to make estimates of product return rates and expected costs to repair or replace products under warranty 
if actual return rates or repair and replacement costs  or both  differ significantly from management s estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required 
a rollforward of the fiscal accrued warranty liability from may  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension plans the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions including the expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which the liabilities could be settled at april   and the rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with assistance from a third party actuarial firm 
our historical experience with pension fund asset performance is also considered 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for fiscal was percent  a decrease from percent for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant and increasing or decreasing the expected long term rate of return of the plan assets by percentage points would increase or decrease fiscal income before income taxes by approximately million 
the discount rate utilized for determining future pension obligations of the pension plans is based on the expected rate of high quality  long term corporate bonds 
the resulting discount rate decreased from percent at april  to percent at april  holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate for the plans would increase or decrease fiscal income before income taxes by approximately million 
for fiscal  the assumption for the long term rate of increase in compensation levels for the pension plans remained unchanged at percent 
holding all other assumptions constant and increasing or decreasing the long term rate of increase in compensation levels by percentage points would increase or decrease fiscal income before income taxes by approximately million 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates  and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
net deferred tax assets we record net deferred tax assets in amounts we expect to realize based on projected future taxable earnings 
assumptions and estimates are required to assess the appropriateness of the valuation of deferred tax assets such as our ability to generate future taxable earnings 
if we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to decrease earnings would be made in the period of such determination 
as of april   we recorded a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we estimate future taxable income considering tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates  and future taxable income levels 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance resulting in a reduction to net earnings in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets that had already been subject to a valuation allowance  we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance resulting in an increase to net earnings in the period that such determination was made

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to mitigate these risks  we utilize derivative financial instruments  including swaps and forward contracts  among other strategies 
derivative instruments utilized by the company in its hedging activities are viewed as risk management tools  involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exposures 
as of april   the company was party to approximately million in forward exchange contracts  the majority of which are to purchase us dollars with euros and great britain pounds sterling 
the counterparties to the forward exchange contracts were major international commercial banks 
we continually monitor our open forward exchange contract position and do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties 
in management s opinion  these financial instruments do not represent a material off balance sheet risk in relation to the consolidated financial statements 
these forward exchange contracts are recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
as of april   the fair value of contracts outstanding was a million net liability 
if forward exchange rates were percent stronger or weaker versus the us dollar as of april   the fair value of these forward exchange contracts would be a million and million net liability  respectively 
interest rate exposures 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates since it finances its operations through variable interest rate debt 
we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
we estimate that a percent change in the interest rates on our variable rate debt would increase or decrease interest expense in fiscal by approximately million
