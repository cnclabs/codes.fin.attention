table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview applica is a manufacturer  marketer and distributor of a broad range of branded and private label small electric consumer goods 
in  applica acquired the black decker household products group and became a leading supplier of brand name small household appliances in north and latin america 
we also manufacture and distribute professional personal care products  home environment products  pet care products  including the littermaid self cleaning cat litter box  and pest control products 
we manufacture and market products under licensed brand names  such as black decker  our own brand names  such as applica and windmere  and other private label brand names 
our customers include mass merchandisers  specialty retailers and appliance distributors primarily in north america  latin america and the caribbean 
we operate manufacturing facilities in china and mexico 
in  approximately of the products sold by applica were manufactured in such facilities 
in addition  we manufacture products for other consumer products companies  which we refer to as contract manufacturing 
in may  applica acquired weitech  inc for a total of million  including cash and notes 
weitech designs  manufacturers and distributes products that emit high frequency sound waves to repel a variety of pests 
weitech products are sold through mass market retailers  specialty retailers and mail order catalogs  primarily in the united states 
the results of operations of weitech  inc were included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations from the date of the acquisition 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act 
such statements are indicated by words or phrases such as anticipates  projects  management believes  applica believes  intends  expects  and similar words or phrases 
such forward looking statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties or assumptions and may be affected by certain other factors  including the specific factors set forth in item business risk factors 
should one or more of these risks  uncertainties or other factors materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results  performance  or achievements of applica may vary materially from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to applica or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements in this paragraph 
applica disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly announce the results of any revisions to any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events or developments 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of applica s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and applica s actual results are subject to the risk factors listed above under item business risk factors 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity collectibility of accounts receivable 
applica s allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of its customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is believed to be an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management sets specific reserves for customers in bankruptcy and other reserves for the remaining customers based upon historical collection experience 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major customer default on its 
table of contents obligations to applica  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon applica s operations 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  management increased the allowance by million as the result of the further deterioration of one of applica s significant customers 
reserves on inventories 
applica establishes a reserve based on historical experience and specific reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
a charge to operations results when the estimated net realizable value of inventory items declines below cost 
management regularly reviews applica s investment in inventories for declines in value 
income taxes 
significant management judgment is required in developing applica s provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
at december  and  applica had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of million and million  respectively 
applica determined that it was more likely than not that million and million of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of million in and applica evaluates quarterly its ability to realize its deferred tax assets and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance  if necessary 
applica operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
goodwill 
on an annual basis  management assesses the composition of applica s assets and liabilities  as well as the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill will be tested for impairment 
applica will recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value determination 
during the first quarter of  applica recorded a write down of its goodwill of million million  net of tax 
long lived assets 
applica reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of its intangible assets  management performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
applica recognizes an impairment loss if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  applica recorded a million write down of certain intangible assets associated with kmart corporation s decision to terminate its long term supply contract for white westinghouse electronic products and applica s intention not to re market such products to another company 
in the fourth quarter of  an additional write down of million was recorded as a result of a bankruptcy petition filed by kmart corporation 
in  the company abandoned leasehold improvements at its china facility 
these leaseholds related to streamlining its manufacturing and distribution and had a net book value of million 
in addition  with the closing of the shelton  connecticut office  the company disposed of certain leasehold and other fixed assets with a net book value of million 
reserves for product liability claims and litigation 
applica is subject to various legal proceedings  product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary course of its business 
management estimates the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such matters in excess of applicable insurance coverage based on historical claims experience and current claim amounts  as well as other available facts and circumstances 
as the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict and significant estimates are made with regard to future events  significant changes from estimated amounts could occur 
for example  applica increased its reserve for product liability claims and litigation by million in product recall liability 
applica is subject to potential product recalls 
we estimate the amount of ultimate liability based on discussions with the consumer product safety commission and historical claims experience 
for example  in february  we voluntarily recalled our black decker branded t and t toasters 
we charged the operations with an estimated reserve of million for this recall 
applica has charged million against this reserve through december  while we believe that the reserve is adequate  there can be no assurance that significant future adjustments will not be required 

table of contents other estimates 
applica makes a number of other estimates in the ordinary course of business relating to sales returns and allowances  warranty reserves  and reserves for promotional incentives 
historically  past changes to these estimates have not had a material impact on our financial condition 
however  circumstances could change which may alter future expectations 
results of operations the operating results of applica expressed as a percentage of sales and other revenues are set forth in the table below year ended december  net sales cost of sales cost of goods sold repositioning charges and other charges gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating expenses repositioning charges and other charges operating earnings loss other income expense loss on asset held for sale earnings loss before equity in net earnings loss of joint venture and income taxes equity in net earnings loss of joint ventures earnings loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense benefit earnings loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net earnings loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales

effect of inflation our results of operations for the periods discussed have not been significantly affected by inflation 
currency matters while we transact business predominantly in us dollars and most of our revenues are collected in us dollars  a substantial portion of our costs  such as payroll  rent and indirect operational costs  are denominated in other currencies  such as chinese renminbi  hong kong dollars and mexican pesos 
in addition  while a small portion of our revenues are collected in foreign currencies  such as canadian dollars  argentine pesos  colombian pesos  chilean pesos and venezuelan bolivars  a significant portion of the related cost of goods sold are denominated in us dollars 
changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
there can be no assurance that the dollar foreign exchange rates will be stable in the future or that fluctuations in financial markets will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  applica uses forward exchange and option contracts to reduce fluctuations in foreign currency cash flows related to third party raw materials and other operating purchases  as well as trade receivables 
the purpose of applica s foreign currency management activity is to reduce the risk that anticipated cash flows and earnings from foreign currency denominated transactions may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk applica is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies using a variety of financial instruments 
interest rate sensitivity 
our primary market risk exposure with respect to interest rates is changes in short and long term interest rates in the united states 
certain of applica s debt arrangements represent floating rate debt and accordingly  we are subject to interest rate risk 
applica uses interest rate risk management contracts to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on our floating rate debt 
our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to applica s portfolio of borrowings 
applica maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage  which is set by policy 
the table below provides information regarding applica s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected 
table of contents maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments expected to be exchanged under the contract 
weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at the reporting date

exchange rate sensitivity 
our primary market risk exposure with respect to exchange rates is to changes in us dollar mexican peso  us dollar chinese renminbi  us dollar hong kong dollar and us dollar canadian dollar exchange rates 
in addition  we also have exposure to the argentinean peso  colombian peso  chilean peso and venezuelan bolivar 
certain forecasted transactions could expose applica to foreign currency risk 
we purchase currency forwards and options as cash flow hedges of foreign currency forecasted transactions related to the purchase of third party raw materials and other operating expenses 
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of our existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues and expenses 
applica uses option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale and or purchase of foreign currencies to hedge probable  but not firmly committed  expenditures 
the principal currencies hedged are the mexican peso  chinese renminbi  hong kong dollar and canadian dollar 
by policy  applica maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed eighteen months 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
as discussed above  we are exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   applica hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts and purchased options 
we use a sensitivity model to determine a potential change in the fair value of our foreign exchange financial instruments 
the sensitivity model estimates the change in fair value based upon a favorable and unfavorable movement of in the respective spot rate 
the sensitivity model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses or gains in fair value that will be incurred by applica 
it should also be noted that the change in value represents the estimated change in the fair market value of the derivative 
because the derivatives hedge an underlying exposure  there would be a comparable and opposite change in value of the underlying exposure 
the estimated potential change in fair value  calculated using the sensitivity model  is as follows 
table of contents at december  change in fair value due to notional hedge favorable unfavorable amount in us dollars movement in spot movement in spot dollars in thousands mexican peso canadian dollar chinese renminbi total change in fair value it is our policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet our objectives as stated above 
we do not enter into these transactions for speculative purposes
