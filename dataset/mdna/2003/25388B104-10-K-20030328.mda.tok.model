item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the company is a leading provider of comprehensive electronic commerce outsourcing solutions 
the company was incorporated in february and commenced offering products for sale through its clients web stores in august from inception through august  the company had no sales  and its activities related primarily to the development of its proprietary technology platform  known as cns 
in  the company began to focus its business development efforts on the software industry  building its inventory of software products through contracts with software publishers 
in  the company began to develop software distribution relationships through contracts with online retailers 
as of march   the company had approximately  software publisher clients and online retailer clients served by the software and digital commerce services division 
in late  the company began to offer its comprehensive electronic commerce outsourcing services in the form of a transaction fee based e commerce service to clients outside of the software industry 
as of march   the company was operating approximately  sites under its e business services division 
the company has approximately six years of operating history upon which investors may evaluate its business and prospects 
since inception  the company has incurred significant losses  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company intends to expend financial and management resources on the development of additional services  sales and marketing  technology and operations to support larger scale operations and greater service offerings 
although the company expects to generate positive cash flow from operations in  there can be no assurance that the company s revenue will increase or even continue at its current level or that the company will achieve or maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
the company s prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as electronic commerce 
to address these risks  the company must  among other things  attract and retain software publishers and online retailers as clients  attract and retain e business clients  introduce new web sites  web stores or services  continue to upgrade and develop our systems and infrastructure to meet emerging market needs and remain competitive in our service offerings  and retain and attract personnel commensurate with our business needs 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in addressing these risks  and any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s current and future expense levels are based largely on its planned operations and estimates of future revenue 
revenue and operating results generally depend on the volume and timing of orders received  which are difficult to forecast 
the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any significant shortfall in revenue could have an immediate adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is also likely to continue to see revenue fluctuate on a seasonal basis  which is typical for the software publishing market in general and its current e business service clients 
the company believes that its first and fourth quarters tend to be seasonally stronger than its second and third quarters due to the timing of demand for tax preparation software and the holiday season selling period 
in addition  it is the company s belief that software publishers avoid new product releases in the summer months 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of the company s business  the company is unable to accurately forecast its revenue and believes that period to period comparisons of its operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are the following revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from services rendered once all the following criteria for revenue recognition have been met pervasive evidence of an agreement exists  the services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable and not subject to refund or adjustment  and collection of the amounts due is reasonably assured 
the company derives its revenue primarily from transaction fees based on a percentage of the products sale price and fees from services rendered associated with the e commerce services provided to its clients 
these services include web commerce development and hosting  transaction processing  fraud screening  digital delivery  integration to physical fulfillment  merchandising services  analytical marketing and customer service 
the company reports its revenue on a net basis and therefore records only the net service fees and transaction fees as its revenue 
the company acts as the merchant of record on the majority of the transactions processed and has contractual relationships with its clients  which obligate the company to pay to the client a specified percentage of each sale 
the company retains its transaction fee and also charges fees for services rendered 
the company also derives revenue from integration  development and consulting services 
signed contracts are obtained from clients prior to recognition of these revenues 
fees for any integration and development work required to provide on going hosting services for the client are recognized ratably over the term of the contract once collection is reasonably assured 
clients do not have the right to take possession of the software applications used in the delivery of services 
payments received in advance of rendering the service  even if non refundable  are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
revenues from consulting services are recognized using the percentage of completion method for fixed fee arrangements or as the services are provided for time and materials arrangements 
if the company does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or does not manage its projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  future margins may be negatively affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical experience and current trends 
management makes an estimate of anticipated future credit card chargebacks and product returns related to current period revenue by analyzing the timing of historical credit card chargebacks and applying anticipated percentages to current period revenues 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our billed accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the allowance in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets 
the company amortizes property  plant and equipment  certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets with definite lives over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
intangible assets with definitive lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company s evaluation considers nonfinancial data such as changes in the operating environment and business strategy  competitive information  market trends and operating performance
