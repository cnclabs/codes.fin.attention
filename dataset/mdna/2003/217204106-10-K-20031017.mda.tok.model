overview we process salvage vehicles principally on a consignment method  on either the percentage incentive program pip or on a fixed fee consignment basis 
using either consignment method  only the fees associated with vehicle processing are recorded in revenue 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and of the vehicles we sold  respectively  were processed under pip 
we attempt to convert vehicle supplier agreements at acquired operations to pip  which typically results in higher net returns to vehicle suppliers and higher fees to us than standard fixed fee consignment programs 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  approximately  and of the vehicles we sold  respectively  were processed under fixed fee agreements 
due to a number of factors  including the timing and size of new acquisitions  market conditions  and acceptance of pip by vehicle suppliers  the percentage of vehicles processed under these programs in future periods may vary 
our revenues consist of salvage fees charged to vehicle suppliers and vehicle buyers  transportation revenue and purchased vehicle revenues 
salvage fees from vehicle suppliers include fees under pip agreements and fixed fee programs where we charge for title processing  special preparation  storage and auctioning 
salvage fees also include fees charged to vehicle buyers for purchasing vehicles  storage and annual registration 
transportation revenue includes charges to suppliers for towing vehicles under fixed fee contracts 
transportation revenue also includes towing charges assessed to buyers for delivering vehicles 
purchased vehicle revenues are comprised of the price that buyers paid at our auctions for vehicles processed that we own 
costs attributable to yard and fleet expenses consist primarily of operating personnel which includes yard management  clerical and yard employees  rent  contract vehicle towing  insurance  fuel  fleet maintenance and repair  and costs of vehicles we sold under purchase contracts 
costs associated with general and administrative expenses consist primarily of executive  accounting and data processing  sales personnel  professional fees and marketing expenses 
the period to period comparability of our operating results and financial condition is substantially affected by business acquisitions and new openings made by us during such periods 
acquisitions and new operations we have experienced significant growth as we have acquired twelve vehicle auction facilities and established fifteen new facilities since the beginning of fiscal all of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of our overall expansion strategy of offering integrated service to vehicle suppliers  we anticipate acquiring and developing facilities in new regions  as well as the regions currently served by our facilities 
as part of this strategy  in fiscal  we acquired new facilities in or near pittsburgh  pennsylvania  reno  nevada and richmond  virginia and opened new facilities in or near springfield  missouri  corpus christi  texas  ft 
pierce  florida  rancho cucamonga  california  richmond  virginia and albany  new york 
in fiscal  we acquired new facilities in or near new castle  delaware  savannah  georgia  tifton  georgia  charleston  west virginia  haslet  texas and greencastle  pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near lyman  maine  tucson  arizona  somerville  new jersey and amarillo  texas 
in fiscal  we acquired facilities in or near chatham  virginia  shreveport  louisiana and mount morris  pennsylvania and opened new facilities in or near harrisburg  pennsylvania  chicago heights  illinois  martinez  california  lawrenceburg  kentucky and new orleans  louisiana 
in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company acquired a facility in eugene  oregon and opened a facility in toronto  canada 
we believe that these acquisitions and openings strengthen our coverage 
we seek to increase revenues and profitability by  among other things  i acquiring and developing new salvage vehicle auction facilities in key markets  ii pursuing national and regional vehicle supply agreements  iii expanding our service offerings to suppliers and buyers and iv developing and expanding public automobile auction facilities 
in addition  we implement our pricing structure and merchandising procedures and attempt to effect cost efficiencies at each of our acquired facilities by implementing our operational procedures  integrating our management information systems and redeploying personnel  when necessary 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to vehicle pooling costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill  income taxes and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we defer  in vehicle pooling costs  certain yard and fleet expenses of vehicles consigned to and received by us but not sold as of the balance sheet date 
we quantify the deferred costs using a calculation that includes the number of vehicles at our facilities at the beginning and end of the period  the number of vehicles sold during the period and certain yard and fleet expenses of the period 
the primary expenses capitalized are labor  transportation  and vehicle processing 
if our allocation factors change then yard and fleet expenses could increase or decrease correspondingly in the future 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to provide for estimated losses resulting from disputed amounts billed to suppliers or buyers and the inability of our suppliers or buyers to make required payments 
if billing disputes exceed expectations and or if the financial condition of our suppliers or buyers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we evaluate the impairment of goodwill annually at a facility level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
under this accounting policy we have not recognized any charges for the impairment of goodwill 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a facility could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis 
generally accepted accounting principles require the assessment of the company s performance and other relevant factors when determining the need for a valuation allowance with respect to these deferred tax assets 
the company s ability to realize deferred tax assets is dependent on its ability to generate future taxable income 
based on our historical operating earnings  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets recorded and  accordingly  have not established a valuation allowance 
additional timing differences future earnings trends and or tax strategies may occur which could warrant a need for a valuation allowance or a reserve 
we are also required to estimate income tax provisions and amounts ultimately payable or recoverable in numerous jurisdictions 
such estimates involve significant interpretations of regulations and are inherently very complex 
resolution of income tax treatments in individual jurisdictions may not be known for many years after completion of any fiscal year 
we evaluate long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows change in the future  we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated below  certain information derived from our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenues 
there can be no assurance that any trend in operating results will continue in the future 
fiscal years ended july  revenues operating expenses yard and fleet general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased volume at existing facilities  which contributed approximately million in revenue and to new facilities identified below  which contributed approximately million of new revenue 
our revenue growth rate in the current fiscal year decreased from from fiscal to fiscal to from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in revenue growth is due primarily to slower growth in units sold 
given our relatively high historic growth rates we may not be able to maintain these growth rates in future years 
new facilities in or near west mifflin  pennsylvania  reno  nevada  richmond  virginia  springfield  missouri  corpus christi  texas  ft 
pierce  florida  rancho cucamonga  california  richmond  virginia and albany  new york contributed approximately million of new revenue during fiscal yard and fleet expenses were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase in yard and fleet expenses was due principally to the cost of handling increased volume at existing operations and the costs of new facilities

yard and fleet expenses decreased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal general and administrative expenses were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal this increase was due primarily to an increase of approximately million in payroll expense  million in professional services  million in frame connectivity charges and million in various other general and administrative items 
general and administrative expenses increased to of revenues during fiscal  as compared to of revenues during fiscal depreciation and amortization expense was approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal this increase was due primarily to depreciation and amortization of capital expenditures and covenants not to compete and depreciation of acquired assets resulting from the acquisition of new auction facilities 
growth in capital spending in fiscal and prior periods is expected to result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal  a decrease of approximately million  or from fiscal the decrease is due primarily to a reduction in proceeds from the sale of certain fixed assets of approximately million  due to fewer disposals in fiscal interest income decreased approximately million due to lower interest rates and a reduction in the cash balance 
these decreases were offset by an increase in rental income of approximately million 
our effective combined federal  state and local income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues were approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or  over fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased volume and buyer fees at existing facilities  which contributed approximately million in revenue and to new facilities identified below  which contributed million of new revenue

the adoption of financial accounting standards board statement no 
reduced goodwill amortization expense by approximately million for fiscal on a pro forma basis  if the company had applied statement no 
during the prior year  goodwill amortization expense in fiscal would have been reduced by approximately million 
total other income was approximately million during fiscal  an increase of approximately million  or over fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased interest income of approximately million earned on the million raised in our november follow on offering  a disposal proceeds increase of approximately million from the sale of certain fixed assets and a decrease of approximately million in interest expense resulting from a reduction in total debt 
the increase was offset by a legal settlement of approximately million obtained in fiscal our effective combined federal  state and local income tax rate of for fiscal was lower than the combined rate of for fiscal  due to changes in estimated state income tax rates 
due to the foregoing factors  we realized net income of approximately million for fiscal  compared to net income of approximately million for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we have financed our growth through cash generated from operations  public offerings of common stock  the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions and debt financing 
cash and cash equivalents decreased by approximately million in fiscal and increased by approximately million in fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily attributable to a december public offering of our common stock in which we raised net proceeds of approximately million 
the decrease in fiscal was primarily attributable to capital expenditures and our stock repurchase program announced in march our liquidity and capital resources have not been materially affected by inflation 
during the winter months  most of our facilities process to more vehicles than at other times of the year 
this increased seasonal volume requires the increased use of our cash to pay out advances and handling costs of the additional business 
as of july   we had working capital of approximately million  including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
our primary source of cash is from the collection of sellers fees and reimbursable advances from the proceeds of auctioned salvage vehicles and from buyers fees 
we believe that we are able to process  market  sell and receive payment for processed vehicles quickly 
we believe that our currently available cash  cash generated from operations and borrowing availability under our bank credit facilities and equipment leasing lines will be sufficient to satisfy our operating and working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant growth in the future  we may be required to raise additional cash through the issuance of new debt or additional equity 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities decreased by million from fiscal to million in fiscal  due to the timing of routine changes in working capital items

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal exposure to financial market risk is interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio of marketable securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we invest primarily in corporate securities  bank certificates  us treasury and agency obligations  asset backed securities  repurchase agreements  auction rate debt instruments and money market mutual funds and generally hold them to maturity 
consequently  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we do  however  limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and strictly monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our fixed income portfolios 
at the present time  the maximum duration of all portfolios is days or less 
our guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issue as well the type of instruments 
due to the limited duration and credit risk criteria in our guidelines  we do not expect that our exposure to market and credit risk will be material
