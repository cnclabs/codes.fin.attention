revenue increased million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  revenue for increased million  or compared to million for the increase in revenues in the last two years is primarily due to an increase in program support services revenues of which a majority of the growth is from our work on the lockheed martin joint strike fighter program 
gross margin 
gross margin increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the slight increase in over is attributable to our focus and commitment to improve our gross margins on program support services

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional services and other general corporate activities 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due primarily to our investment in our autumn employee offsite meeting held in november no similar event was held in fiscal year as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for year ended december   as compared to for the prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in  as compared to million for as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for  as compared to for the decrease  as a percentage of revenue  is the result of reductions in executive personnel and general corporate overhead resulting from cost control initiatives implemented in december operating income

interest expense  net was  for the year ended december  compared to million  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the fluctuations primarily result from the related levels of debt for the respective years  the amortization of debt discount  and interest expense on our interest rate swap

during and  we recognized a gain of  and a loss of  respectively  resulting from changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement 
the swap agreement was retired in july income tax expense 
our effective tax rate for was compared to and in and  respectively 
the improvement in our tax rate in is related to the job creation and workers assistance act of  the act which was enacted in february the act allows us to benefit from certain net operating losses that we otherwise would not have been able to benefit 
in this regard  in october  we entered into negotiations to  among other things  amend selected sections of the stock purchase and sale agreement with l communications corporation 
the resulting amendment to that agreement allowed us to realize an additional net tax benefit under the act of  
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued discontinued operations on november   we completed the sale of our interest in the common stock of emergent east also known as the government services group or gsg  a provider of system engineering  scientific research  program management and technical support services 
the sale was to an independent third party for million in cash 
accordingly  the operating results of emergent east  including provisions for losses during the period from october  through the closing date  facility lease costs and other costs to be incurred in connection with the sale  have been accrued 
expenses and operating losses from the measurement date of september  through november   the date of disposal  amounted to million  net of income taxes of million 
included in the loss from disposal of discontinued operations in and is approximately million and million  respectively  of allocated interest expense 
we allocated interest under the guidance of eitf  allocation of interest to discontinued operations  using net assets as the basis of the ratio 
on august   our board of directors adopted a plan to discontinue the operations of emergent central  a business segment formed in accordingly  the operating results of emergent central  including provisions for estimated losses during the phase out period  facility lease costs and other shut down expenses incurred in connection with the disposal  were accrued as of september  expenses and operating losses from the measurement date  including the write off of the segment s assets  through the closing date of disposal amounted to million

for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities of million reflected our net income of million  increased by non cash charges of million for the amortization of debt issuance costs and million deferred tax expense offset by a million increase in working capital 
net cash provided by investing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million  which primarily related to a decrease in restricted cash 
a portion of our cash acted as collateral for a stand by letter of credit that guaranteed our obligations under the interest rate swap agreement until the interest rate swap agreement was terminated in july net cash used in financing activities 
for the year ended december   net cash of million was used in financing activities primarily for repayment in full of our subordinated notes and termination of the interest rate swap agreement  offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of stock options 
in january  we entered into a line of credit agreement with a bank for working capital purposes 
the line of credit  which expires on april  and is currently begin renegotiated  provides for maximum borrowings of million  based on eligible receivables  at the prime rate 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of our assets 
the agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants pertaining to our tangible net worth and ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth as defined in the agreement and also contains certain negative covenants which  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell our assets  make certain types of investments and engage in certain types of mergers and acquisitions 
we believe that we will be able to extend or replace the line of credit agreement  but if we are unable to do so  we do not believe that such outcome would be materially adverse to us 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit with million in availability 
our contractual obligations are as follows at december  contractual obligations payments due by period year in thousands total or less years years after years operating leases operating leases related to discontinued operations other obligations total operating leases related to discontinued operations represent office space previously occupied by the emergent east and emergent central divisions 
the amounts above represent the remaining lease commitments over the term of the leases 
during the year ended december   we bought out leases for two properties for  and reduced our net liabilities related to discontinued operations by the same amount 
we have entered into subleases for two of our other leased properties 
these subleases cover a portion of our lease commitments for these properties and we expect these subleases to continue in effect for the life of our lease obligations with respect to these properties 
we are continuing the process of identifying sub lessees for our remaining leased property or negotiating lease buy outs with the lessors 
we believe we have sufficient working capital availability under the line of credit  which expires in april  and cash generated by continuing operations to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
we believe we will be able to extend or replace the line of credit 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our services are provided under time and expenses billing arrangements  and revenue is recognized on the basis of hours worked  plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
revenue is directly related to the total number of hours billed to clients and the associated hourly billing rates 
a limited amount of revenue is also derived from success fees offered to clients as a pricing option  and recorded as revenue only upon the attainment of the specified incentive criteria 
success fees are not billable and revenue is not recorded until the client wins a contract 
we must make estimates of potential future uncollectible accounts receivable related to current period revenue 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  as of december  accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance as of december   because we believe it is more likely than not that we can recover such assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was million
