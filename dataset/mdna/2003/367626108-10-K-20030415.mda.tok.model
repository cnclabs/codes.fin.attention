item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
this report includes forward looking statements made based on current management expectations pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual outcomes may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted 
factors that could cause future results to differ from gateway s expectations include the factors described under business factors that may affect gateway s business and future results beginning on page of this report 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that arise after the date as of which they are made 
during the fourth quarter of  gateway adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
as a result  we changed our revenue recognition policy retroactive to january  to recognize revenue upon delivery rather than shipment of products 
the cumulative effect of this accounting change was an expense of million  net of tax in the pro forma impact of this accounting change on prior periods is not material 
on january   our financial statements were adjusted by an expense of million  net of tax  to record the cumulative effect of adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
gateway restated  and net sales to reduce the amounts of bounty income recognized  and cost of goods sold by the costs incurred for aol bundled internet service sold to our customers  of million  million and million  respectively 
the amounts received from aol were previously included in net sales and the amounts paid to aol were previously included in cost of goods sold 
gateway also restated  and net sales and cost of goods sold to present the cost incurred for a third party provider of extended warranty services of million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of net sales 
in view of the nature of the relationships which we maintained with the parties described above and our customers  gateway determined that it is more appropriate to present such amounts on a net basis 
these revisions had no impact on previously reported gross profit dollars  operating income loss or net income loss per share in any period 
gateway also restated the and financial statements to account for the excess cash proceeds received on the sale of a portfolio of financing receivables as an adjustment to the yield on a loan that was made to an affiliate of the purchaser of the portfolio in gateway originally recorded the excess proceeds as net sales and has revised the accounting to recognize the excess proceeds in other income loss  net over the period from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of the impact of this change was to reduce net income in by approximately million and a corresponding reduction in the net loss by approximately million 
the million is reflected as deferred interest income  net of tax impacts  and is included in other current liabilities as of december  outlook the demand environment continues to be difficult and we cannot count on significant demand uplift in we anticipate revenue for the first quarter of will be approximately million to million  reflecting our sharpened focus on higher margin pc sales and the current weak demand environment 
we expect gross margin dollars in the first quarter of to be in the range of million to million 
in the first quarter of  we closed retail stores in addition to the four stores previously announced 
in addition  we continued to focus on cost reductions by taking further restructuring actions  resulting in the termination of employees 
we also adjusted previously recorded restructuring accruals 
gateway expects to report a charge of approximately million to million for the first quarter of related to these actions 
including the restructuring costs of million to million  earnings per share in the first quarter of are projected to be at a loss of to 
sg a levels in the first quarter of are expected to be approximately 
table of contents million 
we expect sg a levels in subsequent quarters of to be down significantly  and our plan contemplates that fourth quarter sg a expenses will be below million 
in addition  we expect to reduce cost of goods sold by million annually by the end of we expect to be cash flow positive by year end and that we will exit with more than billion in cash and marketable securities  including the million tax refund we received in the first quarter of we also anticipate an effective tax rate of  which will result in pre tax losses being equal to net losses in in addition  we have several major re engineering efforts underway and are evaluating our overall operations and our business across all segments  channels and product lines  in an effort to reduce costs and to return to profitability by the fourth quarter of we also are planning several major new product launches throughout the year and have plans for profitable channel expansion in the very near future 
we are also continuing to evaluate strategies to streamline operations through continuous improvement of manufacturing  assembly  service  and support functions 
actual results may vary depending on our results of operations and other factors  including the risk factors identified elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses gateway s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and gateway s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations requires gateway s management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k summarizes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of gateway s consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following to be critical accounting policies whose application has a material impact on gateway s financial presentation 
that is  they are both important to the portrayal of gateway s financial condition and results  and they require management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition gateway recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as amended  summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
gateway recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue from the sale of products is recognized upon delivery of the products to customers 
revenue from services that are rendered by us  such as extended warranties  is recognized straight line over the service period  while training revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
other than internet services  revenue from the sale of services that are rendered by third parties  such as extended warranties and installation is generally recognized when delivered 
we offer our customers internet services which are provided by a third party 
the revenue associated with these services is based on the monthly active subscriber counts  which are reported to us by the service provider and is recognized as the services are provided 
if the actual subscriber counts or the economics associated with these subscriber counts prove to be less than originally reported by the service provider  we may be required to adjust revenue associated therewith downward  as occurred in the fourth quarter of gateway records reductions in revenue in the current period for estimated future product returns related to current period revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowances in any accounting period 
if actual returns exceed estimated returns  we would be required to record additional reductions to revenue 

table of contents gateway records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to customer incentive programs  including customer rebates and other sales incentives  including  among other things  trade ins and referral credits 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to increase customer incentive programs that could result in incremental reductions of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
additionally  certain incentive programs require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the particular incentive programs 
if a greater than estimated proportion of customers redeem such incentives  we would be required to record additional reductions to revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts gateway maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the estimate is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific customers 
we record an allowance to reduce the specific receivables to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
we also record an allowance for all other trade receivables based on multiple factors including historical experience with bad debts  the general economic environment  the financial condition of our customers  and the aging of such receivables 
we do not expect default rates to be greater than of business segment net sales 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s financial condition or we become aware of additional information related to the credit worthiness of a major customer  or if future actual default rates on trade receivables in general differ from those currently anticipated  we may have to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts  which would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
gateway does not have a single customer that accounts for or more of our revenue 
inventory valuation the business environment in which gateway operates is subject to rapid changes in technology and customer demand 
we record write downs for components and products which have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand or net realizable value 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory by part each quarter  which includes a review of  among other factors  inventory on hand and forecast requirements  product life cycle including end of life product and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record an adjustment for excess and obsolete inventory 
gateway may be required to record additional write downs if actual demand  component costs or product life cycles differ from estimates which would affect earnings in the period the write downs are made 
warranty provision gateway provides standard warranties with the sale of products 
the estimated cost of providing the product warranty is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we maintain product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers 
estimated warranty costs are affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of experience and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required and would affect earnings in the period the adjustments are made 
taxes on earnings gateway records a tax provision benefit for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations 
the provision for benefit from income taxes is computed using the liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   
table of contents our valuation allowance was approximately million 
gateway has considered our ability to carryback losses  forecasted earnings and future taxable income and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we were to later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made 
as of december   the net deferred tax asset is approximately million 
litigation gateway is currently involved in certain legal proceedings where the amount or range of loss can be estimated 
a liability is recorded in these instances when the loss is considered probable 
where a liability is probable to occur in connection with litigation or governmental proceedings and there is a range of estimated loss  we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to the legal proceedings and revise those estimates 
revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations in the period of adjustment 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain data derived from our consolidated income statements dollars in thousands increase decrease increase decrease net sales gross profit percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses percentage of net sales operating income loss na percentage of net sales net income loss na net sales the following table summarizes gateway s net sales for the periods indicated by segment and by geographic region dollars in thousands decrease decrease net sales north america consumer business total north america emea asia pacific consolidated vs

in  million of beyond the box revenue was sold at the point of sale and million was sold after the point of sale compared to million and million  respectively  in the decline in beyond the box revenue on a year over year basis is primarily attributable to the decline in unit shipments as well as our decision to discontinue certain non profitable revenue streams and the insourcing of certain extended warranty service plans 
this transition to insourcing such service plans will reduce the overall cost of providing extended warranty protections and will improve gross margins as such revenue is recognized over the terms of extended warranties in the future 
during the first quarter of  we modified our strategic alliance with america online  inc aol whereby we converted existing gateway 
net customers to the aol branded internet access in order to improve the customer experience and the economic return to gateway for such subscribers 
in addition  we began to participate earlier in a greater share of recurring income on new prepaid isp subscribers 
in the fourth quarter of  aol unilaterally recomputed payments it had made in and the first half of and withheld the claimed overpayments from amounts currently owed to us 
we have disputed aol s retroactive adjustment to the mutually agreed and previously paid amounts and have commenced formal dispute proceedings as required by our agreement 
in view of the uncertainty over our ultimate ability to collect the withheld amounts  we have reduced net sales and gross margins by the approximately million in dispute 
if aol s adjustments are appropriate  we anticipate a reduction of about million to million in future quarterly net sales and gross margins related to gateway aol subscribers 
during  we closed retail locations and exited the year with stores in the united states compared to stores at the end of in the first quarter of  we closed retail locations in the united states 
we are continuing to evaluate the stores and their locations to optimize store traffic and profit characteristics in terms of contribution to multiple channels sales and financial results 
this could result in a decision to close or relocate certain stores in the future 
average selling price asp includes only revenue earned at the point of sale of an associated pc divided by total units

total net sales include revenue from items that are sold independent from the sale of a pc 
aup was  compared to  in  a decrease of 
asp was  in  down from  in  a decrease of 
the decrease in aup and asp is the result of the value pricing and marketing strategy employed by gateway during  as well as  the insourcing of certain extended warranty service plans as described above 
we expect that the pricing environment will continue to be challenging for potentially resulting in further decreases in aup and asp

in  million of beyond the box revenue was sold at the point of sale and million was sold after the point of sale 
the decline in beyond the box revenue on a year over year basis is primarily attributable to the decline in unit shipments as well as our decision to discontinue lower quality consumer lending 
as part of the strategic reviews of gateway s direct sales policy and in response to the decline in consumer demand  we curtailed retail expansion plans in and closed a number of retail locations 
gateway exited with gateway stores in north america as compared to at the end of  and no store within a store locations as compared to at the end of aup was  in compared to  in  a decrease of

the decline in gross margin percentage in compared to is primarily due to the decline in unit shipments  the value pricing and marketing strategy we adopted and maintained in  the aol dispute discussed above  a million provision for losses shared with a third party financing partner on an old loan portfolio  as well as the insourcing of certain extended warranty service plans discussed above  partially offset by the net impact of approximately million for favorable determinations of litigation and contingent liabilities and offset by lower restructuring and other special charges in we earned approximately million  included in net sales  from our customers for certain extended warranty services  of which million  included in net sales and associated cost of goods sold relates to payments to the third party provider of such services 

table of contents vs 
gross profit in declined to billion from billion in  a decrease of approximately from as a percentage of sales  gross profit for decreased to from in the decline in was due in large part to the million loss experienced in the first quarter of on our consumer financing portfolio due to an increase in the provision for loan losses and an additional charge of million at the end of the quarter to reduce the carrying value of our remaining financing portfolio to its estimated net realizable value as we decided to sell such portfolio 
in addition  gross profit was impacted by increased pricing pressures throughout and the million in costs associated with restructuring decisions during the third quarter of which included  among other things  the exit of substantially all gateway owned international operations and the closure and consolidation of manufacturing facilities

the increase in sg a expenses in were primarily due to the restructuring and other special charges in  partially offset by lower expense levels resulting from a combination of the restructuring decisions made in and variable cost declines associated with lower sales volume  as well as other cost reduction efforts 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of net sales in was due  primarily to the de leveraging of expenses during the time frame of significant revenue reductions as described above  and to incremental costs resulting from the execution of our restructuring plans in in july  we announced that we were accelerating the implementation of our strategy that involved transforming gateway from a traditional manufacturer of pcs to a leading provider of personalized technology solutions by better leveraging our existing retail footprint  our brand position and our digital solutions leadership 
this acceleration consolidated our us consumer and business operating units into one sales organization and included the formation of a new digital solutions group 
as part of this shift  we turned our us retail locations into local technology resource centers  serving as hubs for cross functional sales  service and marketing teams that provide customers with personalization and local service and support

our series a preferred stock will automatically convert into our common stock on the third anniversary of its issuance at a conversion rate between and per share based on the fair value of our common stock at the date of conversion 
if our common stock price on that date is comparable to our common stock price as of december   the series a would convert into a total of  shares of our common stock

we expect to fund this total cash outlay from existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows from operations

execution of these past restructuring plans is substantially complete while cash payments are expected to continue until the following represents future payments for contractual commitments associated with operating leases  royalty and licensing agreements and expected cash flow impacts from the restructurings announced in and payments due by period in millions within year years years after years operating leases royalty licensing agreements restructuring total at december   we had approximately billion in cash and marketable securities

during the first quarter of  we terminated our former million bank credit facility under which no loans were outstanding  in order to reduce commitment fees payable under this unused facility 
we had not previously had any loans outstanding under this credit facility  and given our substantial liquidity position  we did not foresee any need to borrow under the facility during its remaining term 
gateway had standby letters of credit and guarantees outstanding at december   amounting to million 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced digital electronics retail offerings  including digital cameras  mp players  digital video gear  software  printers and accessories  in our retail stores 
inventory associated with our in store cash and carry programs was less than million at the end of and will continue to be tightly monitored in in connection with the introduction of the additional digital solutions products but could increase

our maximum exposure under this loss sharing arrangement is million 
additional financing under this loss sharing arrangement ended in the second quarter of the estimated losses as of december  are provided for in our financial statements  however  if the actual losses prove to be greater than estimated it could affect our future results of operations 
we believe that the actual results of this loss sharing arrangement will not materially affect liquidity 
we believe that our current sources of working capital  including our recent income tax refund  will provide adequate flexibility for our financial needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  any projections of future financial needs and sources of working capital are subject to uncertainty 
see forward looking statements and business factors that may affect gateway s business and future results as well as outlook that could affect our estimates of future financial needs and sources of working capital 
we continually evaluate the opportunity to sell additional equity and debt securities  restructure current debt or preferred stock arrangements or otherwise improve our financial position 
the sale of additional equity  convertible debt or convertible equity securities could have dilutive effects on stockholders 
we have also given consideration to share repurchases from time to time  which could have an anti dilutive effect on stockholders 
we will also consider the acquisition of or investment in complementary businesses  products  services and technologies which might affect our liquidity profile or the level of our equity and debt securities 
in the event that we desire to engage in any of these activities  there can be no assurances that any required financing will be available in amounts or terms that are acceptable
