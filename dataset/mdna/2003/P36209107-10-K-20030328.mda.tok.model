 goodwill and other intangible assets the company is required to do an annual impairment test 
the company is in the process of completing its impairment test for management believes the company will incur an impairment impact of approximately million in the first quarter of related to the precision goodwill 
exchange rates and inflation in the following cases elamex s results of operations are generally affected by changes in the exchange rate between pesos and us dollars 
in the case of an appreciation in value of the us dollar against the peso  elamex generally experiences a benefit because its revenues are denominated in us dollars and certain of its costs and expenses are denominated in pesos 
this benefit will be reduced by relative inflation in the peso versus the us dollar due to inflation within mexico  and by competitive pressures from elamex s customers 
in the case of a depreciation of the us dollar against the peso  elamex generally experiences a detriment mirroring the situation as to appreciation of the dollar  and this detriment will similarly be reduced by relative inflation in the us dollar against the peso and increased pricing by elamex 
on october   the mexican government signed a pact with labor and business representatives called the alliance for economic growth the alliance 
the alliance defines a macroeconomic policy designed to support mexico s economic recovery and promote future growth 
under the alliance the mexican government has attempted to boost the economy by providing tax incentives for new business investments  while utilizing wage and price controls to contain inflation 
as part of the alliance the mexican government has committed to maintaining a free flotation system for the peso in the international currency markets 
the alliance also calls for development of social and rural programs 
critical accounting policies and estimates on december   the sec issued fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
fr is an intermediate step to alert companies to the need for greater investor awareness of the sensitivity of financial statements to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying their preparation  including the judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the more critical of these policies are as follows accrued rebates the company enters into contractual agreements for rebates on certain products with its customers 
such amounts are netted against sales and included in accrued advertising and promotions based on management estimates at the date the sales occur 
prepaid slotting allowances prepaid slotting allowances consist of payments to customers for store shelf space and distribution agreements and are amortized using the straight line method over the term of the customer contract or proportionally with sales recorded  based on the nature of the slotting contract 
contracts generally vary in length from one to seven years and provide for fixed payments or payments upon achievement of sales benchmarks 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method  as required by sfas no 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
 the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
provisions for taxes are made based upon the applicable tax laws of mexico and the united states 
in conformity with sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are not provided for differences related to assets and liabilities that are remeasured from pesos into us dollars using historical exchange rates and that result from inflation indexing for mexican tax purposes or exchange rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future 
the company estimates a valuation allowance based on the historical results of operations and expected results in each individual entity 
revenue recognition for metal stamping and food products sales are recognized at the time the order is shipped 
for contract manufacturing sales are recognized when the order is shipped for manufacturing contracts and over the contract period for assembly services 
anticipated losses on assembly services contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determined 
allowances for bad debts the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral to support amounts due for the sale of its products 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its best estimate of accounts receivable 
initial manufacturing costs direct manufacturing contract costs related to initial manufacturing layout and setups for new contracts initial manufacturing expenses are expensed in the current period when such costs are not considered significant 
when such costs are considered significant  the portion of such costs expended for capital equipment is capitalized and is amortized using the straight line method during the length of the applicable contract 
no manufacturing contract costs have been capitalized for the years ended december   and in addition  labor costs required to achieve normal productivity levels are expensed in the period incurred 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  which include property  goodwill  intangible assets and certain other assets  comprise a significant amount of our total assets 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  the carrying values of these assets are periodically reviewed for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
this requires us to make long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
these forecast require assumptions about demand for our products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
elamex does not engage in futures contracts with the purpose of hedging us dollar peso revenues or costs  with the exception of regular treasury operations to cover operating requirements for up to days

tax losses and other certain adjustments for us gaap purposes do not affect employee statutory profit sharing 
employee statutory profit sharing expense is reflected in elamex s cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses  depending upon the function of the employees to whom profit sharing payments are made 
elamex s net income on a consolidated basis as shown in the consolidated financial statements is not a meaningful indication of net income of elamex s subsidiaries for profit sharing purposes or of the amount of employee statutory profit sharing
