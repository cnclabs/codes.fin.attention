item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgements  including those related to accounts receivable  inventories and warranty obligations 
by their nature  these estimates and judgements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience  observance of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and other outside sources and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company generally obtains oral or written purchase authorizations from customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and considers delivery to have occurred at the time of shipment 
asv maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of asv s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
adjustments to slow moving and obsolete inventories to the lower of cost or market are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
the company evaluates the adequacy of the inventories carrying value quarterly 
warranties 
asv provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while asv engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  asv s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from asv s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of earnings data as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales gross profit selling  general administrative expense research development operating income net earnings net sales 
for the year ended december   net sales totaled approximately  an decrease over net sales for the year ended december  due to several offsetting factors 
first  the company had no machine sales of the private label version of the rc all surface loader under its alliance with polaris  the asl  in  which had accounted for approximately million in second  the company had decreased sales of its and series posi tracks  due to the introduction of additional mtl models in and the continued softness in the overall construction equipment sales market 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased mtl undercarriage sales of approximately million  as asv began supplying undercarriages for two additional mtl models that were introduced by caterpillar in the company also experienced increased sales of approximately million from its r series product line due to the introduction of the rc and r products in the first quarter of in addition  sales of service parts increased in as the number of machines and undercarriages in the field continued to increase 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to approximately  compared with approximately  in this increase was the result of several offsetting factors 
first  the company began shipping the polaris asl  during the first quarter of the asl accounted for approximately of the company s unit sales in second  in the second quarter of  the company began shipping undercarriages to caterpillar for the jointly developed mtl product line manufactured by caterpillar 
shipments of these undercarriages accounted for of the company s unit sales for offsetting these increases was a decrease in sales of the company s model posi track 
unit sales of the posi track in were approximately one half the unit sales in the company believes this decrease was primarily attributable to the overall softening of the construction equipment market and the introduction of the mtl products 
unit sales of the company s other products series  md  hd and track truck were approximately the same in as gross profit 
for the year ended december   gross profit was approximately  or of net sales  compared with approximately  or of net sales for the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the decreased sales for the increase in the gross profit percentage was due to the following offsetting factors 
first  as discussed above  the company had no polaris asl sales in  which carry a lower gross profit than the company s other products  thereby causing an increase in the gross profit percentage for compared to second  the company had increased sales of service parts in  which generally carry a higher gross profit than finished goods 
offsetting these increases  the company sold a greater concentration of lower margin mtl undercarriages in as compared to as caterpillar was not able to produce its two larger mtl models for the majority of due to a production issue unrelated to asv s undercarriage 
in addition  the company experienced fewer sales of its higher margin model posi track as discussed above 
gross profit for the year ended december  was approximately  or of net sales  compared with approximately  or  for the decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to a change in the sales mix experienced in during  the company had a high concentration of sales of the private label asl  which carries a lower gross profit than any of the company s other products  but requires significantly less sales and marketing costs 
the company experienced fewer sales of its higher margin model posi track due primarily to industry wide softening of construction equipment sales and the introduction of the mtl products 
finally  the company continued to offer discounts off standard dealer net terms to reduce its inventory of the series posi track 
offsetting this decrease was a warranty reimbursement benefit 
during the fourth quarter of  asv negotiated a warranty reimbursement program with one of its suppliers  whereby the company will receive product at no cost in the future to compensate asv for warranty claims incurred during plus any claims not yet filed 
asv recognized a benefit of  under this program in the fourth quarter of as an offset to warranty costs incurred during the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended december  the decreased level of expenses was due to the following two items 
first  in  the company established a remarketing reserve of  the company established this reserve for costs associated with remarketing existing machines at one customer s locations  some of which were ultimately returned to the company 
asv had originally anticipated these machines would be remarketed to other dealers  but instead chose to have certain of these machines returned to asv for use in its program of marketing to rental facilities 
as these machines were returned to asv and reflected as sales returns with a corresponding decrease in gross profit of approximately  a portion of the remarketing reserve was no longer needed 
the company reversed the portion of the remarketing reserve that related to the returned machines  which decreased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately  in second  the company had decreased commissions to caterpillar as the number of commissionable products sold to caterpillar dealers decreased in selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately  for the year ended december   compared with approximately  for the decreased level of expenses was due primarily to decreased commissions paid to caterpillar as a result of the change in sales mix experienced during the company pays no commission to caterpillar on the sale of any mtl undercarriages  the rc or the asl offsetting this decrease was the establishment of a remarketing reserve of  in the fourth quarter of this reserve relates to costs associated with remarketing existing machines at the locations of one dealer 
research and development 
for the year ended december   research and development expenses decreased  to approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended december  this decrease was due primarily to the completion of the development  testing and integration of the final undercarriages used in caterpillar s mtl product line 
research and development expenses increased in to approximately  compared with approximately  in the increase was due to the company s alliance with caterpillar for the continued development  testing and integration of the undercarriages for the mtl product line 
in addition  during  the company was developing the newest models in its r series product line  the r and the rc  which were introduced in january the company anticipates research and development expenses will decrease again in as the development of the undercarriages for caterpillar s mtl product line was completed in the company anticipates its investment in research and development will approximate of its net sales for other income expense 
for the year ended december   interest expense decreased to approximately  compared with approximately  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the company refinancing approximately  of its long term debt from to for a five year term in december interest expense was approximately  in  compared with approximately  in the decrease in was due to decreased line of credit usage 
this was a result of the proceeds received from the sale of common stock to caterpillar in the fourth quarter of other income was approximately  for  compared with approximately  for and approximately  for the decrease in was due primarily to lower interest income from lower interest rates and decreased short term investments as the company used these investments to fund operations in the increase in was due primarily to greater interest income from increased short term investments 
this resulted from increased cash flow  due primarily to the proceeds received from the sale of common stock to caterpillar in the fourth quarter of net earnings 
for the year ended december   net earnings increased to approximately  compared with approximately  in the increase in net earnings was due to lower operating expenses and an increased gross profit percentage  offset in part by decreased sales and an increased effective income tax rate 
net earnings for the year ended december  were approximately  compared with approximately  for although net sales increased in  this decrease resulted from a lower gross profit percentage and increased research and development expenses 
offsetting this decrease was a decrease in the company s effective income tax rate in due to greater research and development tax credits 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company had working capital of approximately  compared with approximately  at december  while overall working capital remained relatively the same during the period  several components changed 
first  cash and short term investments decreased approximately  due primarily to funding operations during second  accounts receivable decreased approximately  from better accounts receivable management and a greater use of finance companies to finance certain customer sales 
third  inventories increased approximately  from december  the majority of this increase was due to an increase in finished goods of approximately  due to lower than anticipated sales in the first and third quarter of in addition  the company elected to produce the majority of the rc s and series posi tracks it expected to need for when it could not complete mtl undercarriages during the first quarter 
current liabilities decreased approximately  at december  compared with december   due primarily to the company having no income tax liability at december  this was due to company utilizing the additional depreciation deduction available for income tax purposes  as well as the utilization of a research and development tax credit carryforward from in october  the company and caterpillar entered into an alliance agreement to jointly develop and manufacture a new product line of caterpillar rubber track skid steer loaders called multi terrain loaders  or mtls 
the product line  which includes five new models  features caterpillar s patented skid steer loader technology and asv s patented maximum traction support system tm rubber track undercarriage 
the machines complement existing models in both asv s and caterpillar s current product lines 
they are being sold through the caterpillar dealer network 
the company recognizes as sales its cost for the undercarriage  as defined in the agreement  plus a portion of the gross profit that caterpillar will recognize upon sale of the mtl to caterpillar dealers  when the company ships undercarriages to caterpillar 
the mtls are not a commissionable product under the company s commercial alliance agreement with caterpillar 
the company anticipates its sales of mtl undercarriages to caterpillar could approach million 
in december  the company made a sale to one customer totaling approximately million 
during  this customer did not make payments in accordance with the terms of its agreement with the company  including approximately  of machines and attachments sold by the customer for which payment was not remitted to the company 
the company has been working closely with this customer to develop a plan for the payment of the amounts owed 
in january  the company and the customer entered into a note agreement for the value of the machines that had been previously sold by the customer for which payment was not remitted to the company 
the initial amount of the note was  and is due in monthly installments plus interest at the prime rate plus  beginning march  the customer has made payments on a timely basis under this note 
should the customer be successful in raising a minimum of million through a private placement offering  the company has agreed to convert  of the note balance to shares of convertible preferred stock in the private placement 
the company has also obtained a security interest in the machines that have not yet been sold by the customer 
in addition  the customer has agreed to remit payment to the company for any machines it sells  which the customer has been doing 
in september  the company s stock buy back program expired 
under that program  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an aggregate purchase price of approximately  on october   the company announced a new stock buy back program whereby asv may repurchase up to million of its common stock in the open market 
the company is funding the repurchases with available funds 
the repurchase program is expected to last to october  or until such amount of common stock is repurchased 
as of march   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock under this new buy back program at an aggregate purchase price of approximately  in october  the company began a program to market its rc and rc products directly to rental facilities 
under this program  asv identifies rental facilities that will lease asv machines from an unaffiliated finance company 
asv records the sale of the machines to the finance company when they are delivered to the rental facility and receives payment from the finance company at that time 
the lease agreement between the rental facility and the finance company provides the rental facility a day period during which any rental income generated is split between the rental facility and asv 
after the day period has expired  the rental facility has the option of terminating the lease  in which case asv is responsible for the costs associated with transferring the machines to another rental facility 
if the rental facility elects to continue the lease  asv will refund any rental payments received during the day period 
at the end of the four year lease  should the rental facility elect not to purchase the leased machines  asv has guaranteed to pay a residual value equal to of the original selling price of the financed equipment should the rental facility choose not to make the residual payment 
at that point  asv would take possession of the equipment 
as of december   the total amount of future residual payments the company may be required to make in the event of nonpayment by rental facilities totaled approximately  the company believes the value of the related equipment will equal or exceed the amount of residual payment 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate any loss will be incurred should any residual payments need to be made 
during and  the company provided extended term financing programs  generally not exceeding days  to its customers 
this extended term financing program contributed to the increase in the company s accounts receivable balance in the company did not utilize this type of program to the same extent in instead  the company affiliated itself with several finance companies that finance the sale of the company s products 
by using these finance companies  the company receives payment for its products shortly after their shipment 
the company pays a portion of the interest cost associated with financing these shipments that would normally be paid by the customer  generally ranging from three to twelve months  depending on the amount of down payment made by the customer 
the company is also providing twelve month terms for one machine to be used for demonstration purposes for each qualifying dealer 
the company believes this change in how the company expects to receive payment for the sale of its products  its existing cash and marketable securities  together with its available  unused million credit line  will satisfy the company s projected working capital needs and other cash requirements for the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future
