questar regulated services reported a increase in earnings for compared with the prior year due to increased nongas margin revenues less gas costs  expansion of the gas transmission system and increased volumes transported for firm transportation customers 
corporate and other operations reported higher income before a change in the method of accounting for goodwill 
the increase was primarily due to cost reduction efforts at a data hosting business 
the goodwill  related to the data hosting business  was determined to be impaired and written off based on a new accounting rule adopted in the first quarter of results of operations questar market resources questar market resources qmr or market resources through its subsidiaries conducts gas and oil exploration  development and production  gas gathering and processing  and energy marketing operations 
primary objectives of energy marketing operations are to support the company s earnings targets and to protect the company s earnings from adverse commodity price changes

this increase was achieved despite qmr s sale of producing properties and deliberate curtailment of approximately bcfe of production due to low prices 
however  revenues were lower in low prices  primarily for natural gas produced in the rocky mountains  plagued qmr for much of rockies prices  net to the well  were below per mcf for much of approximately of qmr s production comes from the rockies 
qmr acquired producing properties in the uinta basin of utah in july  which provided a significant portion of the year to year production growth 
also  development of the uinta basin properties and the pinedale anticline in southwestern wyoming was the prime contributor to production increases in and the basis differential between daily prices in the rockies and the henry hub louisiana at times exceeded per mmbtu  far greater than the historic average of 
to 
gas prices in the rockies have been impacted because transportation capacity out of the region has not kept pace with the region s growing production rate 
while this imbalance should be partially remedied with an expansion of the kern river pipeline  scheduled to begin operation in mid  it may persist for some time 
prices received on production from midcontinent properties have been much higher 
to protect against the possibility that the rockies basis will again widen in the second and third quarters of  qmr has hedged a substantial portion of its proved developed production in the rockies 
qmr s energy hedges partially mitigated poor rockies gas prices in qmr hedged or presold approximately of its nonregulated natural gas production and of its nonregulated oil production 
as a result  the average realized selling price for natural gas amounted to per mcf and exceeded unhedged prices by

questar gas does not earn a return on the cost of gas  or on the cost of gathering and transporting gas for its customers 
gas costs  including gathering and transportation costs  are passed through to ratepayers without markup 
in  the public service commission of utah pscu allowed questar gas to recover million of gas processing costs that had previously been denied 
in  the pscu authorized questar gas to begin recovering the gas cost portion of bad debt expense in its pass through costs  which boosted questar gas s margin by million

the margin increased million in compared with  primarily as the result of a million annualized general rate increase in utah  effective august   and a larger customer base 
questar gas pays an affiliated company to remove carbon dioxide from its natural gas at a plant that was placed into service in june the pscu approved the recovery of up to million of processing costs per year beginning in august  but did not allow recovery of the costs for the month period between the startup of the plant and august the utah supreme court ruled that the pscu had erred in not considering pass through treatment for these costs 
in august  the pscu ruled on remand that questar gas be allowed to recover million of these costs plus approximately  of interest 
the pscu allowed questar gas to include the gas cost portion of bad debt expenses in utah s semi annual gas cost filings effective january  a similar measure was approved by the public service commission of wyoming pscw effective july  usage per residential customer has been declining to per year over the past decade 
the decline has been attributed to more energy efficient appliances and home construction  and customer response to higher energy prices

the pscu previously used a historical test year to set rates 
the company challenged this practice in a general rate case filed in may effective december   the pscu approved an million general rate increase and an rate of return on equity 
the pscu based the rate increase on year end costs and usage per customer 
this change in test year may mitigate the impact of declining usage per customer in temperatures were colder than normal in  however  temperatures have been warmer than normal for five of the last six years

qmr has an unrated commercial paper program with a million capacity 
qmr s commercial paper borrowings are limited to and supported by available capacity on qmr s existing revolving credit facility 
the company typically has negative net working capital at december because of short term borrowing 
the borrowing is seasonal and generally peaks at the end of the year because of the lag in customer receivables related to cold weather gas purchases 
in november  moody s downgraded debt ratings of questar and subsidiaries one level after completing a review that began may  moody s established a prime rating for questar commercial paper  an a senior unsecured debt rating for both questar pipeline and questar gas  and a baa rating for the senior unsecured debt of qmr 
also  moody s established a stable outlook for each questar entity 
a lower debt rating may increase the company s cost of debt  however  moody s revised ratings are solidly investment grade 
the downgrade will not materially affect the company s growth strategy 
standard poor s has assigned an a rating to questar s commercial paper rating  a to the long term debt issued by questar gas and questar pipeline  and a bbb to debt issued by qmr 
standard poor s has a negative outlook  reflecting concerns that the company s risk profile may increase with its plan to grow unregulated businesses 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
management believes that the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations under the successful efforts method of accounting  the company capitalizes the costs of leaseholds  development wells  successful exploratory wells and related equipment and facilities 
the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are charged to expense when it is determined that such wells have not located proved reserves 
unproved leasehold costs are periodically reviewed for impairment 
costs related to impaired prospects are charged to expense 
costs of geological and geophysical studies and other exploratory activities are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
the company recognizes a gain or loss on the sale of properties on a field basis 
capitalized proved leasehold costs are depleted using the unit of production method based on proved reserves on a field basis 
all other capitalized costs associated with gas and oil properties are depreciated using the unit of production method based on proved developed reserves on a field basis 
the company engages independent consultants to help calculate nonregulated gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
wexpro agreement wexpro s operations are subject to the terms of the wexpro agreement 
the agreement was effective august   and sets forth the rights of questar gas s utility operations to share in the results of wexpro s successful development operations and the rate of return that wexpro will earn for managing questar gas s reserves 
the agreement was approved by the pscu and pscw in and affirmed by the utah supreme court in accounting for derivatives qmr uses derivative instruments  typically fixed price swaps  to hedge against a decline in the average selling prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require that these instruments be marked to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the difference between fair value and carrying value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives 
the company has structured virtually all of its energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
any changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
the company s exploration and production operations use the sales method of accounting for gas revenues  whereby revenue is recognized on all gas sold to purchasers 
a liability is recorded to the extent that the company has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
revenue and prices for gas and oil are reported on a net to the well basis 
rate regulation regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation  distribution and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
questar gas and questar pipeline follow sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation that requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  pscu and pscw have approved the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities 
recording of unbilled revenues questar gas records revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the revenues for the period from the date the bills are sent to customers to the end of the month are estimated each month and trued up on an annual basis in the summer 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
weather normalization questar gas has provisions in its rates to adjust the amounts charged to customers on a monthly basis to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on nongas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the amount of weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and trued up on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
this accounting treatment has been approved by the pscu and pscw 
group depreciation both questar gas and questar pipeline use group depreciation for the majority of their fixed assets 
under this policy  assets are depreciated in groups of similar assets rather than on an individual asset basis 
when an asset is retired  the original cost and a like amount of accumulated depreciation are removed from the books 
the method has the typical impact of increasing depreciation expense from what would be recognized under the individual asset method  and eliminating gains and losses when a group depreciated asset is retired 
assets that can be separately identified  such as buildings  vehicles and computers  are depreciated on an individual asset basis 
the ferc  pscu and pscw have approved the use of group depreciation 
employee benefit plans independent consultants hired by the company use complex models to calculate the yearly expenses of pension  postretirement benefits and benefit payments to recipients of a long term disability program 
the models consider mortality estimations  liability discount rates  return on investments  rate of increase of compensation  amortizing gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates among the key factors 
management is asked to make assumptions based on parameters and advice offered by the consultants 
it is the company s general policy to contribute to the pension fund an amount approximately equal to its yearly expense 
in  questar recorded an additional minimum pension liability of million  a million intangible pension asset and an after tax comprehensive loss of million 
a decrease in the fair value of pension plan assets combined with a lower discount rate caused the calculated accumulated benefit obligation to exceed the fair value of the pension plan s assets 
the condition can be remedied by an increase in fair value of assets  an increase in the discount rate and or through additional contributions from the company 
the company has decided not to increase the amount of its pension contributions due to income tax penalties 
new accounting standard sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  was issued in june of sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting of the fair value of legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
the new standard requires that plant abandonment costs be estimated at fair value  capitalized and depreciated over the life of the related assets 
the new standard will impact recording abandonment costs of gas and oil wells and processing plants 
recognition of abandonment costs for a majority of the gas distribution  transportation and storage properties will be postponed indefinitely due to the nature of the assets as defined by sfas the company has not completed its evaluation of the impact of sfas however  these expenses are noncash until abandonment takes place 
sfas is effective beginning january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk qmr s primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas  oil and other hydrocarbons and changes in interest rates 
qmr sold its canadian affiliate in the fourth quarter of  eliminating its foreign exchange risk 
a qmr subsidiary has long term contracts for pipeline capacity for the next several years and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments 
qmr bears a majority of the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses energy price hedging arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements 
however  these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements 
the hedging contracts exist for a significant share of qmr owned gas and oil production and for a portion of energy marketing transactions 
commodity price risk management the company has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives 
the primary objectives of energy price hedging are to support the company s earnings targets and to protect earnings from downward movements in commodity prices 
the volume of production hedged and the mix of derivative instruments employed are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the company s board of directors 
it is the company s current policy to hedge up to of the current year s proved developed production by the first of march in the current year  at or above selling prices that support its budgeted income 
the company will add incrementally to these hedges to reach forward beyond the current year when price levels are attractive 
the company does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves 
natural gas prices in the rocky mountain region were depressed in the basis differential  the difference between rockies prices and the benchmark henry hub louisiana price  at times exceeded per mmbtu  the widest differential in nearly a decade 
this widening basis differential results from a combination of increased regional production  weak seasonal demand  and inadequate capacity in pipelines that transport rockies gas out of the region 
rockies prices may remain depressed until regional demand increases and or major new export pipelines are built 
the expansion of the kern river pipeline will improve pipeline capacity out of the rockies but may not immediately return rockies basis to historical ranges 
with the acquisition of sei in  increased investment in development of the company s pinedale anticline acreage and sale of canadian properties  a growing percentage of the company s production is in the rockies 
management s attention has been focused on improving rockies prices by hedging approximately of rockies proved developed production at an average of per mcf net to the well 
in addition  the company may curtail production if prices drop below levels necessary for profitability 
qmr held energy price hedging contracts covering the price exposure for about million dth of gas and million bbl of oil as of december  a year earlier qmr hedging contracts covered million dth of natural gas and million bbl of oil
