the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to principles of consolidation  revenue recognition  inventories  depreciation and amortization  start up costs  impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  fair value of financial instruments and segment reporting 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

direct expenses as a percent of revenue for the year ended december   decreased to from in as membership levels and therefore revenues increase at the sports club la clubs opened in and  the direct expense percentage should continue to decrease

there is no assurance  however  that said expansion or economies of scale will be achieved 
our selling expenses were million for the year ended december   versus million in  an increase of million or 
the increase in selling expenses was the result of expanded advertising and promotion efforts at the five sports club la clubs opened in and with the majority of this increase attributable to our two most recently opened clubs

depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  as a result of the sale of the sports club las vegas on january  and by  at our other sports club la clubs primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated

liquidity and capital resources capital requirements existing operation on april   we issued in a private placement million of senior secured notes the senior secured notes due in march  with interest due semi annually 
the senior secured notes were issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture agreement dated april  the indenture 
the senior secured notes are secured by substantially all of our assets  other than certain excluded assets 
the indenture includes certain covenants that restrict our ability to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay dividends or other distributions  or repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  and iii make certain investments 
the indenture also limits our ability to i enter into transactions with affiliates  ii create liens on or sell certain assets  and iii enter into mergers and consolidations 
the indenture requires us to make semi annual interest payments of million on march th and september th of each year 
we incur capital expenditures for normal replacement of fitness equipment and updating clubs 
our clubs are upscale and capital improvements are regularly needed to retain the upscale nature and presentation of the clubs 
a deterioration of the quality of the clubs can lead to reduction in membership levels and lower revenues 
we estimate that expenditures of between and of revenues  depending on the age of the club  will be necessary to maintain the quality of the clubs to our satisfaction 
we also expect to spend approximately  during the next year to upgrade our management information systems and enhance our disaster recovery capabilities 
all our mature sports clubs clubs open at least three years currently generate positive cash flow from operations 
newly developed clubs tend to achieve significant increases in revenues until a mature membership level is reached 
in the past  recently opened clubs that have not yet achieved mature membership levels have operated at a loss or at only a slight profit as a result of fixed expenses that  together with variable operating expenses  approximate or exceed membership fees and other revenue 
the time period necessary to achieve positive cash flows is dependent upon the membership levels and amount of fixed costs 
historically  it may take two years before a new club achieves positive cash flow from operations 
three of our new clubs now generate positive cash flows while two of the new clubs require cash to fund their operating activities 
our consolidated cash flows from operations for each of the last three years were negative 
we expect this trend to continue until the newly opened clubs generate sufficient positive cash flows 
our ability to generate positive cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon increasing membership levels at these clubs and we cannot offer any assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
at december   we had million of outstanding equipment financing loans 
we make monthly principal and interest payments on this debt 
these monthly payments are currently  and they will continue until december  when a significant portion of the debt will be repaid 
the indenture requires us to make an offer to retire senior secured notes if the net proceeds of any asset sale are not reinvested in assets related to our business  unless the remaining net proceeds are less than million 
to the extent we sell assets  such as the sports club las vegas and our real estate in houston  the proceeds from those sales would be subject to the excess proceeds provision of the indenture 
we were not required to make such an offer as a result of the sale of the sports club las vegas or the houston real estate because the net proceeds were below the million level 
other than our normal operating activities and capital expenditures  our total cash requirements for our existing operations through december  are estimated to be as follows amounts in thousands indenture interest  information system upgrades payments on long term debt  contractual obligations the following schedule lists known contractual obligations amounts in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years senior secured notes   equipment financing loans    operating leases      minority interest redeemable preferred stock 
 total      on april   we issued in a private placement million of senior secured notes due in march with interest due semi annually 
the equipment financing loans are secured by furniture  fixtures and equipment 
the amounts are generally repayable in monthly payments over four or five years with effective interest rates between and 
we lease certain facilities pursuant to various operating lease agreements 
club facility leases are generally long term and noncancelable triple net leases requiring us to pay all real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses  and have an average remaining term of years  including renewal options which are included in the lease term  with the earliest sports club lease expiration date of january  we are also obligated under lease agreements for seven of our former spectrum club locations 
we have subleased each of these properties to the buyer of these clubs under sublease agreements which provide that all operating costs of these facilities be assumed by the new owners 
we own a interest in the partnership that owns the sports club la los angeles  and d 
michael talla  our co ceo  beneficially owns the remaining 
under certain circumstances  we have an option to purchase mr 
talla s interest in the partnership for  we have not included the annual minority interest payment of  to mr 
talla in the above table 
on march   the company issued  shares of series b preferred stock 
the stock is redeemable by the stockholders on march  capital requirements new clubs on april   we signed a lease to develop the sports club la beverly hills 
the new sports club la  which will be approximately  square feet  will be located at wilshire boulevard in the heart of the beverly hill s retail and commercial district 
anticipated development costs and working capital requirements are approximately million 
due to our limited financial resources  we are seeking development partners or alternative financing subject to the restrictions in the indenture to finance this project 
we view the beverly hills market as an excellent location for the sports club la brand and this club may serve as a prototype for smaller sized clubs to be built in locations near existing sports club la sites 
cash and credit availability our december  cash balance was million 
on november   we amended our loan agreement with comerica bank california effective as of october  the amended agreement extends the maturity date of our credit facility until november  the credit facility bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus or the bank s prime rate at december  
the loans are secured by all the assets of the sports club irvine and are guaranteed by three of our major stockholders 
the loan agreement amendment added kascy  lp  an affiliate of kayne anderson capital advisors  lp as a lending participant in the credit facility 
kayne anderson capital advisors  lp and certain of its affiliates own all of our series b redeemable preferred stock 
the credit facility increases from million to million once kascy  lp satisfies certain regulatory requirements 
at december   no cash advances were outstanding under this credit facility and million was utilized in the form of letters of credit  leaving million available for future borrowings 
an additional million will be available for future borrowing once kascy  lp becomes duly licensed as a lender and the credit line increases to million 
at december   we were not in compliance with one of the covenants required under our loan agreement 
comerica bank california has waived this default 
the bank s waiver only covered the quarter ended december  and therefore it is likely that we may incur a similar default for the various reporting quarters during if this occurs  the bank will have the option of terminating the credit agreement or continuing to waive any new defaults 
if the bank terminates the credit agreement two of our major shareholders  who now guarantee the bank credit line  have committed to providing us with sufficient financial support to continue our operations 
during our operating activities generated million and we made interest payments of million resulting in a net use of cash from operating activities of million 
we believe we will continue to generate positive cash flow from operations  before pre opening expenses  capital expenditures and debt service and that such amount will increase as our new clubs continue to mature 
the indenture allows us to incur up to million of equipment financing obligations 
at december   we had million of equipment financing obligations outstanding and would be allowed to finance an additional million with our equipment serving as collateral 
recently we have not been able to find lenders who would finance our new equipment purchases 
summary during the year ended december  we improved our liquidity by completing million in preferred stock issuances and completing the sale of our assets in las vegas  nevada and houston  texas 
these transactions generated million of cash 
we have also recently renewed our bank credit facility and as of december   have million available for borrowing under the agreement 
we expect to soon increase our bank credit availability by another million 
in our opinion  our current cash balance at december  plus our available credit under our bank credit facility which we expect to refinance or extend beyond the current maturity date of november  and our projected cash flows before capital expenditures and debt service are estimated to be adequate to cover our debt service and projected on going capital expenditures for the twelve months ending december  if our projected cash flows before capital expenditures and debt service do not meet our estimates or our available credit under our bank credit facility decreases or becomes unavailable  we may need to sell additional assets or offer additional equity securities to meet our cash flow needs through december  there can be no assurance that we would be able raise to additional capital by selling additional assets or by offering additional equity securities 
however  two of our major shareholders  who now guarantee the bank credit line  have committed to providing us with sufficient financial support to continue our operations 
in order to continue to service our interest obligations after december  we will need to increase our operating cash flows above the current levels or secure additional capital 
due to our limited financial resources  additional funds will be required to undertake any future acquisitions or the development of additional new clubs  including the sports club la beverly hills 
we would consider entering into joint ventures  partnership agreements or management agreements subject to the restrictions and limitations on such transactions in the indenture for the purpose of developing new clubs  but only if such arrangements would generate additional cash flow or further enhance the sports club la brand name in the market place 
to the extent that adequate resources are not available we would delay development of the sports club la beverly hills 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  we must make estimates in the following areas revenue recognition 
we receive initiation fees and monthly membership dues from our members 
substantially all of our members join on a month to month basis and can therefore cancel their membership at any time 
initiation fees and related direct expenses  primarily sales commissions  are deferred and recognized  on a straight line basis  over a period of three years 
dues that are received in advance are recognized on a pro rated basis over the periods in which services are to be provided 
reserves are recorded against the receivables of our sportsmed subsidiary at the time the services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we provide a reserve against our receivables for estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  economic conditions and historical losses and our customers creditworthiness 
the likelihood of a material loss from this area is minimal due to our limited exposure to credit risk 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically assess the impairment of our long lived assets which require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances a a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset or asset group  b a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset or asset group is being used or in its physical condition  c a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset or asset group  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  d an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset or asset group  e a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or asset group  or f a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if the projected cash flows to be generated by long lived assets do not exceed the carrying value of the long lived assets the long lived asset would be considered to be impaired 
the impairment we would recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
valuation of goodwill 
prior to january   we amortized goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired in business acquisitions  over years 
in january  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result have ceased to amortize goodwill 
instead  we were required to perform a transitional impairment review of our goodwill as of january  we evaluated the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
and determined that no impairment charge was required upon adoption of this standard 
the impairment test was performed through comparison of our fair value determined primarily by our market capitalization with the net carrying value of our assets 
we are also required to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis 
we performed the analysis as of december  and determined that no impairment was necessary 
litigation reserves 
in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in a variety of legal matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income  our ability to deduct tax loss carry forwards against future taxable income  the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate and any significant changes in the tax laws 
off balance sheet transactions 
we have not entered into any off balance sheet transactions 
forward looking statements from time to time we make forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements include the words may  will  estimate  continue  believe  expect or anticipate and other similar words 
the forward looking statements generally appear in the material set forth under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations but may be found in other locations as well 
forward looking statements may also be found in our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission and in our press releases and other public disclosures 
these forward looking statements generally relate to our plans and objectives for future operations and are based upon managements reasonable estimates of future results or trends 
although we believe that our plans and objectives reflected in or suggested by such forward looking statements are reasonable  such plans or objectives may not be achieved 
actual results may differ from projected results due to unforeseen developments  including developments relating to the following o the availability and adequacy of our cash flow and financing facilities for our requirements  including payment of the senior secured notes  o our ability to attract and retain members  which depends on competition  market acceptance of new and existing sports and fitness clubs and services  demand for sports and fitness club services generally and competitive pricing trends in the sports and fitness market  o our ability to successfully develop new sports and fitness clubs  o disputes or other problems arising with our development partners or landlords  o changes in economic  competitive  demographic and other conditions in the geographic areas in which we operate  including business interruptions resulting from earthquakes or other causes  o competition  o changes in personnel or compensation  and o changes in statutes and regulations or legal proceedings and rulings 
we will not update forward looking statements even though our situation may change in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our bank credit facility has a variable interest rate 
accordingly  our interest expense could be materially affected by future fluctuations in the applicable interest rate 
at december   we had no cash advances outstanding under the credit facility and million was utilized in the form of outstanding letters of credit 
we are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we had senior secured notes totaling million due in march bearing an interest rate of 
annual interest of million is payable semi annually in march and september 
at december   the fair value of the senior secured notes is approximately million 
a change in interest rates of would impact our interest expense by approximately million per year
