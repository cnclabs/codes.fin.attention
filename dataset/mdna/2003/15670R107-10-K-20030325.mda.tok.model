item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
these forward looking statements fall within the meaning of the federal securities laws that relate to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
we assume no obligation to update any of the forward looking statements after the date of this report or to conform these forward looking statements to actual results 
overview we develop  manufacture and market fully integrated systems that enable sophisticated genetic and dna analysis of patients and organisms by automating complex manual laboratory procedures 
based on state of the art microfluidic and microelectronic technologies  our easy to use systems analyze complex biological samples in disposable cartridges designed to perform rapidly and automatically all of the steps associated with sophisticated molecular biological procedures 
we are focusing our efforts on those applications where rapid genetic and dna testing is particularly important  such as the infectious disease  biothreat and cancer testing markets 
in particular  we have designed our systems to be capable of use in genetic management of disease  performing a broad range of genetic tests that include identifying infectious organisms  evaluating at risk populations for the early detection of disease such as cancer  determining the stage of the disease and assessing what might be the most effective therapy 
we also have designed our systems to detect food  air and water contaminants rapidly through genetic identification of disease causing agents 
we are collaborating with strategic partners to co develop assays  or biological tests  and to provide marketing and sales support across a broad range of markets 
we commenced commercial sales of our first product  the smart cycler  in may the smart cycler is a dna amplification and detection system initially directed at the life sciences research market 
we began shipping the smart cycler ii  which features various enhancements to the smart cycler  in november we believe our smart cycler products allow users to analyze biological samples faster and more efficiently than any other product currently available 
our genexpert system  currently in the final stages of development  integrates automated sample preparation with our smart cycler amplification and detection technology 
we expect to launch the genexpert system in unregulated markets in the second half of following clinical trials and fda approval  we anticipate commercial launch of the genexpert system to the clinical genetic assessment market in early we believe that the genexpert system is the only genetic analysis system that integrates automated sample preparation with genetic analysis  while also offering customers a complete testing system comprised of both instrumentation and disposable cartridges containing all necessary reagents for a particular test 
significant accounting policies and management judgements we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  the inventory reserve  and warranty accrual to be critical policies 
inherent in our determination of when to recognize revenue  and in our calculation of our inventory reserve and warranty accrual  are a number of estimates  assumptions and judgments 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments include deciding whether the elements required to recognize revenue from a particular arrangement are present and estimating the amount of inventory obsolescence and warranty costs associated with shipped products 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped  when there is a persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
no right of return exists for our products with the exception of damaged goods 
we have not experienced any significant returns 
contract revenues related to research and development agreements and government grants are recognized as the related services are performed based on the performance requirements of the relevant contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  with no continuing involvement required by us are recognized on the earlier of the date the payments are received or when collection is assured 
under research and development agreements  we are required to perform specific research and development activities and are reimbursed based on the costs associated with each specific contract over the term of the agreement 
milestone related revenues are recognized when the achievement of the specified milestone has been achieved provided that such milestone was at risk at the inception of the arrangement and milestone related obligations are fulfilled 
deferred revenue is recorded when funds are received in advance of services to be performed 
determining whether the elements required for us to recognize revenue are present including  for example  determining whether there is sufficient evidence that an arrangement exists  the collectibility of billings is reasonably assured and contractual performance obligations and milestones have been met requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect our operating results 
inventory reserve and warranty accrual 
we maintain reserves for inventory obsolescence and warranty costs that we believe are reasonable and that are based on our historical experience and current expectations for future performance of operations 
the inventory reserve is established utilizing management s estimate of the potential future obsolescence of inventory 
a substantial decrease in demand for our product could lead to excess inventories and could require us to increase our reserve for inventory obsolescence 
our warranty accrual is established utilizing management s estimate for the future costs of providing customers with a calibration as well as the cost of repairing any instrument failures during the one year warranty period 
a significant change in failure rates of our smart cycler system could lead to increased warranty costs and could require us to increase our warranty reserve 
if such adverse conditions were to occur  we cannot readily predict what effect on our financial condition or results of operations would result  as any such effect would depend on both future results of operations and the magnitude and timing of the adverse conditions 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues we derive our revenue principally from sales of the smart cycler and associated disposable reaction tubes and  to a lesser extent  from contractual payments for services rendered in research and development arrangements 
total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenues for the year ended december  as compared to prior year was due to an overall increase in product sales  offset by a decline in contract revenues 
total product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year 
the growth in product sales for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year resulted from an increase of in instrument sales  particularly of the smart cycler system  initial prototype sales of our genexpert system  and an increase of more than in reagent and disposable sales  particularly our disposable smart cycler reaction tubes 
the increase in product sales was due to the growth of sales through our international distribution network and direct sales force in the united states  and growing market acceptance of the smart cycler system 
for the year ended december   product sales through distributors represented of our total product sales including instruments  reagents  and disposables 
we had no direct customers that represented more than of product sales for either of the years ended december  or december grant and government sponsored research revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease resulted from a decline in the number of active government contracts worked on during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
research and development contract revenue increased  to  for the year ended december  this increase resulted from work performed in conjunction with our participation in the pilot program to develop a biothreat detection system for the usps 
we believe both grant and government sponsored research revenue and research and development contract revenue could decline in upcoming fiscal year as we continue to increase our product marketing efforts and shift our business away from research and development 
cost of product sales cost of product sales consists of raw materials  direct labor  manufacturing overhead  facility and warranty costs 
cost of product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars of cost of product sales for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was driven by the corresponding increase in product sales 
our product gross margin percentage for the year ended december  was as compared to for the prior year period 
the increase in product gross margin for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period was due to increased economies of scale due to increased production volume and an increase in the average selling price of our smart cycler system resulting from more direct sales offset by increased warranty costs 
the increase in warranty costs is primarily due to approximately million in warranty costs recognized in the third quarter of to enhance the reliability of the smart cycler system 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of salaries  amortization of deferred stock compensation  research and development materials  facility costs  and legal expenses for intellectual property protection and regulatory matters 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from a million increase in facilities costs related to our new company headquarters  a million increase in wages and other personnel related expenses  and million increase in depreciation and amortization  partially offset by a million decrease in the amortization of our non cash deferred stock compensation and a million decrease in outside engineering and consulting costs 
the overall increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year was primarily related to our to our efforts to complete the development of the genexpert system 
we expect that our research and development expenses will increase slightly in from as we realign or  where necessary  add to  our existing resources to further our product development efforts  particularly with respect to developing additional assays for the smart cycler and genexpert systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries  amortization of deferred stock compensation  severance costs  accounting and other professional fees  facility costs  and human resource expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year period was due to a million increase in salaries and personnel related expenses  primarily comprised of salaries for increased sales  marketing and executive headcount  million in severance costs  a million increase in sales commissions due to increased product sales  a million increase in travel and lodging costs primarily due to our expanded direct sales force  and a million increase in legal costs  partially offset by a million decrease in our amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in compared to the level as we realign or  where necessary  add to  our existing resources in order to continue to execute our business strategy  particularly with respect to our efforts to increase european sales through our new entity european subsidiary  cepheid sa 
interest income  net net interest income decreased to  in from million in the million decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents balance as well as lower interest rates resulting in lower interest income 
interest expense also increased due to increased borrowings on our lease line of credit during the year end december  restructuring expenses we incurred restructuring expenses of  related to the restructuring plan that we completed during the quarter ended september  the restructuring charge was primarily composed of severance costs for terminated employees and to small degree of professional fees and the write off of impaired assets 
in connection with the plan  our headcount was reduced by approximately 
the purpose of the restructuring plan was to realign our workforce to reflect our shift in emphasis from research and development to manufacturing and marketing of our instruments and reagent systems 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we expect that we will realize a near term reduction in our annual operating expenses of approximately million which is comprised of salaries and consulting fees 
however  we will be redeploying approximately million of those savings in as we expand our commercialization activities 
there are no remaining cash payments to be made under this restructuring plan at december income taxes we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december  and  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance  as the future realization of the tax benefit is not currently likely 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards  research credit carryforwards and capitalized research and development costs 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million 
our federal net operating loss and credit carryforwards  if not offset against future taxable income  will expire from through under the provisions of the internal revenue code of  substantial changes in ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues total revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues in and include and million  respectively from the sale of smart cycler instruments and reaction tubes 
a limited number of smart cycler prototypes were sold in and associated revenue was recognized in and through april we launched the smart cycler in the united states through our distributors fisher scientific in may  in the far east through takara in the fourth quarter of  in europe through eurogentec in the fourth quarter of  and in malaysia and singapore though biosyntech sdn bhd in the second quarter of from launch through the end of december  we had sold more than smart cycler systems and over million reaction tubes 
over three quarters of the sales during those years were through distributors and the majority of sales were through fisher 
fisher s business is focused primarily on the research market 
most of its sales have been to academic laboratories  but a portion has been to biotech and pharmaceutical companies 
our own direct sales efforts are focused on the government  including domestic preparedness and public health labs  plus potential collaborators and industrial customers  primarily food related 
our largest customer category is academics universities  which represented about of sales in the next two largest categories are government and biotechnology pharmaceutical companies 
they represented approximately and  respectively of sales in during the year  the company s addition of a direct sales force helped to improve direct sales specifically in the food testing and biothreat markets 
additionally  the terrorist attacks of september increased focus on the potential of bioterrorist attacks 
increased funds have been allocated to various government agencies for military and homeland defense 
the company experienced an increased demand for its smart cycler family of products in the third and fourth quarter of we believe that increase was due both to the addition of our direct sales force and the impact of the september terrorist attacks 
grant and government sponsored research revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increased level of activity on the contracts as they were completed during the year ended december  research and development contract revenue decreased by to  from million in the company switched its focus from grant and government sponsored research to the expansion of its smart cycler sales efforts and the development of its genexpert product 
during  we focused on the completion of our existing government research and development contracts 
as a result  essentially no new grant and government sponsored research or research and development contracts were executed in cost of product sales cost of product sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to the increase in product sales  partially offset by increased economies of scale due to higher unit volumes 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease included a decrease of million in non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
the million increase in research and development expenses is comprised of a million increase in salaries and personnel related costs  partially offset by a million increase in facility and related costs offset by a million decrease in outside consulting and million increase in expensed furniture and equipment 
development activities switched to genexpert in from smart cycler in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this million increase is attributable to a million increase in salaries and related personnel costs  a million increase in facilities and related costs  a million increase in corporate legal and other professional fees  a million increase in insurance costs  a million increase in investor and public relations  and a million increase in temporary help and consulting partially offset by a million decrease in non cash charges related to the amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
during  the company added small direct sales force focused on distributor support as well as direct sales in the food testing and biothreat markets 
additionally  the company increased its advertising and promotional activities for its smart cycler product line 
these activities resulted in a substantial year over year increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
interest income  net net interest income decreased to million in from million in the million decrease was due primarily to decreased interest income resulting from a decrease in our cash and cash equivalents during as well as a decrease in interest rates and resulting investment yield during as compared to income taxes we incurred net operating losses in and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be substantially limited due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net deferred tax asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
the net valuation allowance increased by million during the year ended december  deferred tax assets relate to net operating loss carryforwards  research credit carryforwards and capitalized research and development costs 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and restricted cash  compared to million as of december  net cash used for operating activities was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   net cash used for operating activities consisted of million in net loss and a million increase in working capital offset in part by million of amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation and million of property and equipment amortization and depreciation 
for the year ended december   net cash used for operating activities consisted of million in net loss and a million decrease in working capital for the period  offset in part by million of stock based compensation and million of amortization and depreciation 
for the year ended december   net cash used for operating activities consisted of million in net loss and a million decrease in working capital for the period  partially offset in part by million related to the amortization of non cash deferred stock based compensation and million of property and equipment amortization and depreciation 
through december   we had received net proceeds of million from sales of common and convertible preferred stock  including net proceeds of million from the sale of  shares of common stock in august under a shelf registration statement  net of issuance costs of million 
in addition  in march  we completed another offering of common stock under the shelf registration statement for net proceeds of approximately million 
through december   we had financed equipment  land  and building purchases and leasehold improvements totaling approximately million 
as of december   we had million in equipment financing obligations 
these equipment obligations are secured by the financed equipment  bear interest at a weighted average interest rate of and are due in monthly installments through september under the terms of our current equipment financing agreement  a balloon payment is due at the end of each individual lease term for an item of equipment 
in june  our existing equipment line of credit was amended to allow us to borrow an additional million  of which we drew down million in the second quarter of and million in the third quarter of in connection with this amendment  we entered into a negative covenant pledge agreement pursuant to which we were required to complete a cumulative million financing by september  or all funding under the equipment line of credit would cease and we would be required to provide a cash deposit or irrevocable letter of credit equivalent to of all soft costs financed 
soft costs primarily represent leasehold improvements and custom manufacturing equipment 
we did not complete the required level of cumulative e financing prior to september  and  as a result  we provided a letter of credit in the amount of million to the creditor in october and will not be able to draw down additional funding 
in december  we purchased land and a building for approximately million for our newly formed french subsidiary 
we financed the purchase with a ten year mortgage loan  which bears interest at per year and is fully secured by the land and building 
additionally  the loan is guaranteed by a standby letter of credit in the amount of million 
the collateral for this standby letter of credit is classified as a component of restricted cash at december  net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended  and net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million from the maturity of marketable securities  offset by million in capital expenditures and million in restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million in capital expenditures  million for the purchase of marketable securities  offset by million in restricted cash 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from sales of common stock and proceeds from loan arrangements partially offset by principal payments under the loan arrangements 
we received million  million  and million in cash from financing activities for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million in included proceeds of million from sales of common stock  including million from our august common stock offering  and million in proceeds from equipment and mortgage loans  offset by repayments of million on our equipment and mortgage loans 
the million in included proceeds of million  net of issuance costs  from sales of common stock and convertible preferred stock and proceeds from equipment loans of million  offset by repayments of equipment loans of million 
our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter  are currently as follows in thousands less than after contractual obligations year years years years total equipment and mortgage loans 
  operating leases     research funding minimum royalty payments  total contractual cash obligations     we expect to have negative cash flow from operations through at least the end of we expect our cash use to average approximately million per month for for the year ended december   total cash used was million or million after subtracting out the million in net proceeds received from our august common stock offering 
after the proceeds of approximately million from our march common stock offering  we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations through the end of this expectation is based on our current operating plan and may change as a result of many factors  including our future capital requirements  which depend on a number of factors outside our control 
for example  our future capital requirements will depend on  among other things  market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the need to acquire licenses to new technology or to use our technology in new markets  and the availability of other financing 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital 
to the extent operating and capital are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of up to million in debt and or equity securities 
as of december   we had approximately million still available under this registration statement 
after our common stock offering completed in march  we have approximately million still available under this registration statement 
there can be no assurance that additional debt or equity financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies or products that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize 
although we have no current plans  agreements or commitments providing for any acquisition  we may  if the opportunity arises  use net proceeds from an offering of equity or debt securities to acquire or invest in products  technologies or companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in short term commercial paper and money market funds 
due to the short term nature of the investments  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore we have not included quantitative tabular disclosure in this form k 
we do not enter into financial investments for speculation or trading purposes and are not a party to financial or commodity derivatives 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all sales to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not made any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
