item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  about the markets in which we operate and our business and prospects  including statements about the sufficiency of our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents  our short term investments and our bank lines of credit to meet our working capital requirements  and the effect of interest rate changes on the value of our short term investments  our bank lines of credit and our foreign currency cash balances 
these statements are subject to many risks and uncertainties which may result in different or disappointing future business and financial results 
many of these risks and uncertainties are discussed in this report  including under certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial condition 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   our net revenues increased to million from million reported for fiscal this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the increased sales of our chipset products into set top box and advanced dvd players 
our revenues from sales of chipset products in the set top boxes and advanced dvd players for the consumer appliance market increased from to of our total net revenues compared to last year  while our revenues from sales of board  chipset  and console products to commercial streaming video market and pc add in market decreased from to of our total net revenues compared to last year 
we believe that the ongoing decline in demand for chipsets and boards in the pc add in market  and delays in the deployment of streaming video applications in the commercial streaming video market which utilize our products  may continue 
should these trends continue  they would likely reduce our revenues and harm our business 
net loss for the fiscal year ended january  was million as compared to net loss of million for the prior fiscal year 
the decreased net loss for fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year resulted primarily from the increase in revenues and improvement of our gross margin 
the net loss for fiscal included a charge of approximately  of impairment losses of which  was a complete elimination of the carrying amount of an investment of a closely held technology company in which we own less than of this company s outstanding capital stock  due to the continued weakness in the software development industry  and  was related to a joint venture partnership 
the net loss for fiscal included a charge of approximately  for impairment losses related to an investment in the same closely held technology company we had in fiscal the following table shows certain items as a percentage of net revenues  which are included in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal fiscal fiscal net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative other income expense net loss attributable to common shareholders net revenues the following table sets forth our net revenues in each product group  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each product group  for the last three years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal boards    chipsets    other    total net revenues    our board level product lines are targeted at oem customers to address the dvd upgrade market  system integrators to address the computer based training  kiosks  and corporate video on demand markets and consumer markets for upgraded multimedia products 
our chipsets are targeted toward manufacturers and large volume oem customers building interactive multimedia products for business and consumer markets 
the other category includes netstream consoles for the commercial streaming video market  set top box products and accessories targeted at the consumer appliance market  support service revenues under agreements for providing software support  development revenues under agreements for the customization of certain mpeg decoding chips and freight fees charged to customers 
the costs related to support service revenues and development revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses respectively 
the decrease in revenues from our mpeg board products in fiscal as compared to fiscal is mainly attributable to our decision to focus on the chipset products in the video on demand and consumer appliance market instead of board products in the pc add in market 
we expect our revenues from mpeg board products to be relatively insignificant in future periods 
the significant increase in revenues from our chipset products in fiscal is attributable to the continuing growth of demand for our chipset products from the consumer appliance market  leading to increased unit sales and higher introduction selling prices of our new mpeg chipsets 
the decreases in revenues from our mpeg board and chipset products in fiscal as compared to fiscal are largely due to the continuing decline in demand for our products in pc dvd upgrade markets 
the overall decrease in net revenues from other products in fiscal as compared to fiscal is mainly attributable to the decreased sales of our consoles to the commercial streaming video market and the reversal of  of unbilled development revenue in the second quarter of fiscal  which had been previously recorded under the percentage of completion method in fiscal the reversal was due to extensions in the development schedule of a particular contract that subsequently arose 
the overall decrease in net revenues from other products for fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to a decrease of development fees due to fewer development projects and the increasingly complex nature which requires longer time to develop 
we expect that net revenues from other products will continue to fluctuate 
the table below sets forth our net revenues by market segment  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each market segment  for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal commercial streaming video market 
   consumer appliance market    pc add in market    other market  total net revenues    the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to the commercial streaming video market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is mainly attributable to decreased sales of our console products in the corporate streaming video market 
the increase in revenues from sales of our products to the commercial streaming video market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is mainly attributable to increased sales of our mpeg board products and the introduction of our new console products in the corporate streaming video market 
we expect our revenues from the commercial streaming video market to continue to fluctuate year over year primarily due to the project oriented nature of sales of our products to our corporate streaming video market 
the significant increase in revenues from sales of our products to the consumer appliance market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to increased sales of our mpeg chipset products to set top box and dvd player manufacturers 
the increase in revenues from sales of our products to the consumer appliance market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to increased sales of our mpeg chipset products to set top box manufacturers 
the consumer appliance market still remains in an emerging phase and we expect fluctuating revenues to continue 
the increase in revenues from sales of our products to the pc add in market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to the introduction of our new mpeg xcard 
the decrease in revenues from sales of our products to the pc add in market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is due to the continuing decline in demand for products in the pc add in market 
we expect our revenues from the pc add in market to be relatively insignificant in future periods as a result of our decision to focus on the video on demand and the consumer appliance market 
the category other market in the above table consists of freight charged to customers  service revenues under agreements for providing software support  development fees under agreements relating to the development for customization of certain mpeg decoding chip technology and accessories for projects and products for various market segments 
the overall increase in net revenues from other market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is mainly attributable to the introduction of our support services and freight fees charged to customers  which has been included as revenue since the beginning of fiscal the overall decrease in net revenues from other market in fiscal as compared to fiscal is attributable to a decrease in development fees due to fewer development projects and the increasingly complex nature which requires longer development time 
due to the uncertainty of volume of support services and development projects we are able to obtain  and the increasingly complex nature of projects which require longer development time  we expect that net revenues from other market will continue to fluctuate 
the table below sets forth our net revenues by geographic region  and the percentage of total net revenues represented by each geographic region  for each of the last three fiscal years dollars in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal united states    asia    europe    canada other regions total net revenues    our asia revenues were derived predominantly from customers in japan and china 
revenues generated from japan and china  respectively  in fiscal accounted for and of our total net revenues  as compared to and for fiscal and and for fiscal our europe revenues in fiscal were derived predominantly from customers in denmark 
revenues generated from denmark in fiscal accounted for of our total net revenues  as compared to for fiscal and fiscal one customer based in europe  two customers based in the us and two customers based in asia accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal in fiscal  three customers based in the us and one customer based in europe accounted for of our total net revenues  and in fiscal  two customers based in the us and three customers based in asia accounting for of our total net revenues 
the decrease in the us revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the decreased sales of our console products in the corporate streaming video market while the increase in asia and europe revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the increased sales of our chipset products in the set top boxes and dvd players for the consumer appliance market 
the decrease in the us and asia revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the continuing decline in demand of our pc dvd upgrade products in the pc market  while the increase in europe revenues from fiscal to fiscal was primarily attributable to the project oriented nature of our commercial streaming video products to the corporate streaming video market 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was approximately in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal this improvement was due to our continuing efforts to reduce the cost of our original mpeg boards and chipsets  and the introduction and sales of our new mpeg chipset and board products 
in addition  the costs related to support service revenues and development revenues were included in sales and marketing expenses  and research and development expenses respectively  while the provisions for inventory obsolescence which were included in cost of revenues decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and from million in fiscal we expect our gross margins will vary from period to period due to changes in the mix of product sales  volume discounts  our costs  and provisions for inventory obsolescence 
because average selling prices of our products typically decline over the life of a product  if we are unable to reduce costs faster than the rate of such decline or introduce new products with higher average selling prices  our gross margins will decline 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal those increases were largely due to increased headcount and expenses associated the expansion of our product marketing and sales development group 
we believe that our sales and marketing expenses will increase in future periods as we intend to increase headcount in our sales and marketing organization and to expand our product marketing and sales development 
research and development expenses increased  or in fiscal over fiscal and  or in fiscal over fiscal the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to the prototype costs of new products 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily attributable to additional engineering staff at our headquarters as well as at our development center in france  consulting services  and capital equipment related to product development 
we plan to continue our efforts in the development of our proprietary mpeg based products  and expect research and development expenses will likely increase by to on a year over year basis at least for the near term 
our general and administrative expenses increased  or in fiscal from fiscal the increase was largely due to increasing costs of insurance and various professional services 
our general and administrative expenses decreased million or in fiscal from fiscal the decrease was mainly attributable to the significant reduction of approximately million of bad debt expense from fiscal excluding the bad debt expense  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was comparable to fiscal we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase relatively in future periods due to the continually increasing cost of insurance  professional services and other expenditures associated with our business 
liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company recorded a net loss of million  million  and million for fiscal   and  respectively  and has an accumulated deficit of million as of january  in addition  the company has experienced negative operating cash flows for fiscal and the company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to achieve sustained profitability and generate positive operating cash flows 
during fiscal  we plan on taking several measures toward achieving positive cash flows as well as increasing available cash in the near term 
these plans are based on our belief that the company will have sufficient demand from its customers that will result in an increase in revenue to achieve breakeven or positive cash from operations by the first quarter of fiscal there is no assurance that our plans will be successful 
to conserve cash and ensure that the company has adequate working capital  we have made a decision to retain current staffing while reducing costs in all other non essential areas 
in addition  to increase working capital  we raised additional gross proceeds of million in march through a private offering of our common stock 
as of january   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  and short term investments of million  a decrease of million compared with million at january  excluding the restricted cash of million  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  at january  as compared with million at january  this decrease resulted from operating activities that utilized cash of approximately million  acquisitions of fixed assets and leasehold improvements to our new headquarters facility of  repayment of capital lease obligations of  and cash used for other investing activities of  which was partially offset by proceeds of  from the issuance of our common stock under our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
contractual obligations total capital operating payments due by period leases leases year or less years   years total   as of january   we had million outstanding under a million bank revolving line of credit that expires in october  bears interest at term deposit rate at january  plus  and is primarily collateralized by funds on deposit in accounts that have been assigned to the lender and is included in our consolidated balance sheet at january  as restricted cash 
the restricted cash balance of million is not available to fund operations  as it is held by the bank as collateral for the line of credit in an equal amount 
we also have a million bank line of credit under which we had availability to draw down approximately million as of january  the line of credit will expire in october and is primarily collateralized by our accounts receivable 
as of january   we had utilized  of the standby letter of credit under this second line of credit 
the lines of credit contain certain covenants that  among other things  required us to maintain certain levels of tangible net worth plus subordinated debt based on our projected operating results 
at january   we were required to maintain total net equity worth of at least million 
as of that date  we were in compliance with this covenant 
in addition  we have a bank line of credit of million that expires in october  which is secured by substantially all the company s assets 
borrowings under this arrangement are subject to certain conditions and are available to us commencing march our primary sources of funds to date have been cash generated from operations  proceeds from preferred and common stock issuances  and bank borrowings under lines of credit 
it is possible that our operations will continue to consume cash in the foreseeable future 
based on our cash projection  we believe that our current reserve of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments including the proceeds from our private offering of common stocks in march will be sufficient to meet anticipated working capital requirements and other cash needs for the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will be able to comply with or make modifications to the current covenants to maintain the availability of funds under our existing asset based banking agreements 
the estimate of time our cash and other resources will last is a forward looking statement that is subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below  as well as other factors  and actual results may differ as a result of such factors 
certain factors affecting business  operating results  and financial condition you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing sigma 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
we have a history of operating losses and we could sustain future losses 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable and if we continue to lose money  our business may not be financially viable 
we incurred significant operating losses in fiscal     and and had negative cash flow in fiscal   and since our introduction of the realmagic mpeg product line in november  we have made significant investments in marketing and technological innovation for our realmagic products 
as a result of our investments  we experienced significant losses through fiscal fiscal  and also included significant losses associated with products other than those related to our realmagic technology 
fiscal  and included significant loss associated with the decline in demand of our realmagic products 
since our inception through january   our total accumulated deficit is  we cannot assure you that we will be able to sell our realmagic products in substantial quantities or generate significant revenues from those sales 
we cannot assure you that we will not incur operating losses in any future fiscal quarter or fiscal year 
if we fail to comply with or obtain waivers for covenants under our loan obligations  our financial condition will be harmed 
our amended and restated business loan agreement with our bank  dated november   is comprised of three lines of credit which allow for borrowings of million  million and million  respectively 
under the line of credit agreements  which expire in october  we are subject to certain covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain tangible net worth of at least million as of january  since july  we have  on occasion  been in violation of some of the covenants and in all cases have obtained waivers releasing us from our obligation to meet these covenants as of previous dates 
however  it is possible that we may need a waiver for future periods and there are no guarantees that our bank will grant these waivers 
if we do not meet these covenants and cannot obtain waivers  the lender could accelerate payments on the notes 
payment of these notes  prior to securing additional financing  could substantially weaken our financial condition 
if we do not have sufficient funds available to make full payment of the notes when required  the bank could foreclose on sigma s accounts receivable  inventories  general intangibles  equipment and tangible assets that collateralize the notes  which could harm our business 
if we are unable to maintain our listing on the nasdaq national market  the liquidity of our common stock could be seriously impaired 
our common stock trades on the nasdaq national market  which specifies certain requirements for the continued listing of common stock 
one of these requirements is that we must hold net tangible assets  or total assets less total liabilities  of at least million 
we held net tangible assets of approximately million as of january   and approximately million as of march  consequently  the nasdaq may notify us that we are not in compliance with this listing requirement  and will then likely require us to demonstrate a plan for establishing compliance with this requirement 
if we are unable to demonstrate a satisfactory compliance plan  the nasdaq may seek to de list our common stock from the nasdaq national market 
we believe we qualify for listing on the nasdaq small cap market  however  we cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for our common stock in that market 
if our common stock is de listed  and particularly  if we are unable to list our common stock on an alternative market such as the nasdaq small cap market  it would seriously limit the liquidity of our common stock and impair our potential to raise future capital through the sale of our common stock  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
de listing could also reduce the ability of holders of our common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and as inexpensively as they have done historically  and may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
de listing could also adversely affect our relationships with vendors and customers 
marketing risks and volatility of oem customer sales and resale distribution may harm our business 
our ability to increase sales and achieve profitability depends substantially on our ability to achieve a sustained high level of sales to new oem customers 
we have not executed volume purchase agreements with any of our customers 
our customers are not under any obligation to purchase any minimum quantity of our products 
also  even if we achieve new design wins  we cannot assure you that these manufacturers will purchase our products in substantial volumes 
sales to any particular oem customer fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and are subject to severe price pressures by competitors 
any reductions in those sales could seriously harm our business 
based on our experience in the industry  we expect that our actual sales to oem customers will continue to experience significant fluctuations 
also  estimates of future sales to any particular customer or groups of customers are inherently uncertain 
our ability to achieve profitability also depends on  in a minor way  maintaining our current sales levels of streaming video and pc add in products through domestic and international distributors for resale through corporate markets 
sales to such distributors are typically subject to contractual rights of inventory rotation or price protection 
the failure of distributors to achieve sustained sell through of our products could result in product returns or delayed or uncollectable receivables 
for example  in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded sales returns from one of our distributors in the amount of approximately million recorded as reduction of revenue and million recorded as an increase to our sales return reserve  respectively 
we also provided for a bad debt allowance in the amount of approximately million as of january  such returns and uncollectable receivables could continue to contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining a significant market for these products 
because we depend on a limited number of major customers  the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from these customers or the loss of these customers may adversely affect our business 
during fiscal  only one of our customers accounted for more than of net revenues as compared to three customers that accounted for more than of net revenues in fiscal and in fiscal  one customer in europe  two customers in the us and two customers in asia accounted for of our total net revenues  as compared to three customers in the us and one customer in europe that accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal  and two customers in the u 
s and three customers in asia that accounted for of our total net revenues in fiscal our dependence on a few major customers may continue along with other changes in the composition of our customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellations of orders from major customers or the loss of major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collection from key customers could harm our financial condition 
if the consumer appliance market fails to expand our business will be harmed 
since fiscal  we have shifted our core business from board products to the pc add in market to chipset products to the consumer appliance market  under which our target customers are set top box and dvd manufacturers 
currently  our sales from chipset products to set top boxes and advanced dvd players account for a majority of our net revenues 
we expect that providing advanced digital media processors to the consumer appliance market will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
however  our strategy may not be successful 
given the current economic environment  consumer spending on home entertainment electronics and applications may not increase as we expect and may even decline 
if we experience the delays in the deployment of digital processors and system solutions in the set top boxes and advanced dvd players  or we do not successfully market and sell our products to our target manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into their systems or products  our business will be harmed 
our failure to keep pace with technological change will seriously harm our business 
our success depends  among other things  on our ability to achieve and maintain technological leadership and to remain competitive in terms of price and product performance 
our technological leadership depends on our continued technological advancements and research and development investments in the area of mpeg video and audio decoding 
these advancements include the following compatibility with emerging standards and multiple platforms  improvements to our silicon architecture 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make these advancements to our realmagic technology 
if we do make these advances  we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve and maintain technological leadership 
any material failure by us or oems and software developers to develop or incorporate any required improvement could adversely affect the continued acceptance of our technology and the introduction and sale of future products based on our technology 
we cannot assure you that products or technologies developed by others will not render obsolete our technology and the products based on our technology 
to be competitive  we must anticipate the needs of the market and successfully develop and introduce innovative new products in a timely fashion 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully complete the design of our new products  have these products manufactured at acceptable manufacturing yields  or obtain significant purchase orders for these products 
the introduction of new products may adversely affect sales of existing products and contribute to fluctuations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
our introduction of new products also requires that we carefully manage our inventory to avoid inventory surplus and obsolescence 
during fiscal and  we wrote down our inventory in the amount of approximately million and million respectively  because of a continuing decline in demand for certain of our pc related products 
in addition  new products  as opposed to more mature products  typically have higher initial component costs 
this higher cost could result in downward pressures on our gross margins 
our industry is highly competitive and we cannot assure you that we will be able to effectively compete 
if we fail to compete effectively  our growth could be substantially affected 
the market for multimedia products is highly competitive and is also influenced by embedded processors provided by multiple companies 
processors have  in recent years  included increased graphics functionality 
other companies with more experience and financial resources may develop a competitive product that could inhibit future growth of our realmagic technology 
increased competition may be generated from several major computer product manufacturers that have developed products and technologies that could compete directly with realmagic products 
these competitors include stmicroelectronics  equator technologies  zoran corporation  lsi logic c cube  ess technology  broadcom  cirrus logic  trimedia technologies  ibm  ati  oak technology  texas instruments 
in addition  for some applications  video decoding is done in software operating on today s more powerful cpus 
most of our competitors have substantial experience and expertise in audio  video and multimedia technology and in producing and selling consumer products through retail distribution and oem channels 
these companies also have substantially greater engineering  marketing and financial resources than we have 
our competitors could form cooperative relationships that could present formidable competition to us 
we cannot assure you that our realmagic technology will achieve commercial success or that it will compete effectively against other interactive multimedia products  services and technologies that currently exist  are under development  or may be announced by competitors 
our future revenue growth depends in large part on the adoption of mpeg technology and new codecs 
our business strategy is  and has been  to focus on realmagic products by investing heavily in mpeg technology 
we have made substantial investments in product development based on the latest mpeg technology  mpeg though mpeg has gained some market acceptance  there is increasing competition from microsoft s wmt and the iso h 
standard  a next generation video codec that forms an extension of mpeg though we intend to support new codec technologies as they become commercially viable  there is no guarantee that we can successfully develop these technologies in a timely manner or that competitors will not take the lead with these new technologies 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations due to many factors and any of these factors could adversely affect our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors  including but not limited to new product introductions by us and our competitors  changes in our pricing models and product sales mix  market acceptance of the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular  customer acceptance of our products  shifts in demand for the technology embodied in our products generally and our products in particular and those of our competitors  gains or losses of significant customers  reduction in average selling prices and gross margins  which could occur either gradually or precipitously  inventory obsolescence  write downs of accounts receivable  an interrupted or inadequate supply of semiconductor chips or other materials  for example  our source of supply for silicon wafers was  and may in the near future be affected by earthquakes in taiwan  our inability to protect our intellectual property  loss of key personnel  technical problems in the development  ramp up  and manufacturing of products which could cause shipping delays  the effect of the terrorist attacks in the united states and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide  availability of third party manufacturing capacity for production of certain of our products  and we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to the asia pacific region  which is subject to economic instability 
we cannot assure you that such instability will not have a material adverse effect on any future international revenues 
we face many risks because of our heavy reliance on certain manufacturers and suppliers that could harm our business and financial condition 
our products and components are presently manufactured by outside suppliers or foundries 
we do not have long term contracts with these suppliers 
we conduct business with our suppliers on a written purchase order basis 
our reliance on independent suppliers subjects us to several risks 
these risks include the absence of adequate capacity  the unavailability of  or interruptions in access to  certain process technologies  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
we obtain some of our components from a single source 
in fiscal we experienced a delay and interruption from our source due to the earthquake in taiwan in october we estimate that this event resulted in lost sales of about million 
other delays or interruptions have not occurred to date  but any delay or interruption in the supply of any of the components required for the production of our realmagic silicon or our realmagic multimedia cards currently obtained from a single source could have a material adverse impact on our sales of realmagic products  and on our business 
we must provide our suppliers with sufficient lead time to meet our forecasted manufacturing objectives 
any failure to properly forecast such quantities could materially and adversely affect our ability to produce realmagic products in sufficient quantities 
we cannot assure you that our forecasts regarding new product demand will be accurate  particularly because we sell our realmagic products on a purchase order basis 
manufacturing realmagic chipsets is a complex process  and we may experience short term difficulties in obtaining timely deliveries 
this could affect our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
any such delay in delivering products in the future could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
also  should any of our major suppliers become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture our key components in required volumes  we will have to identify and qualify acceptable additional suppliers 
this qualification process could take up to three months or longer and additional sources of supply may not be in a position to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis 
in the past  we have experienced production delays and other difficulties  and we could experience similar problems in the future 
in addition  product defects may occur and they may escape identification at the factory 
this could result in unanticipated costs  cancellations  deferrals of purchase orders  or costly recall of products from customer sites 
loss of key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
our future success depends in large part on the continued service of our key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel 
given the complexity of realmagic technology  we are dependent on our ability to retain and motivate highly skilled engineers involved in the ongoing hardware and software development of realmagic products 
these engineers are required to refine the existing hardware system and application programming interface and to introduce enhancements in future applications 
despite incentives we provide  our current employees may not continue to work for us  and if additional personnel were required for our operations  we may not able to obtain the services of additional personnel necessary for our growth 
we face risks related to intellectual property rights 
our ability to compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we currently hold twenty two patents covering the technology underlying the realmagic products 
we have filed certain patent applications and are in the process of preparing others 
we cannot assure that any additional patents for which we have applied will be issued or that any issued patents will provide meaningful protection of our product innovations 
like other emerging multimedia companies  we rely primarily on trade secrets and technological know how in the conduct of our business 
we also rely  in part  on copyright law to protect our proprietary rights with respect to our realmagic technology 
we use measures such as confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
these methods of protecting our intellectual property may not be sufficient 
the electronics industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and intellectual property rights 
any such litigation could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation  and we may not be successful in such development or in obtaining such licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  patent disputes in the electronics industry have often been settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we do not yet have a large portfolio of issued patents  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
our international operations are subject to certain risks 
during fiscal   and  sales to international customers accounted for approximately   and of our total net revenues  respectively 
we anticipate that sales to international customers  including sales of realmagic products  will continue to account for a substantial percentage of our net revenues 
also  some of the foundries that manufacture our products and components are located in asia 
overseas sales and purchases to date have been denominated in us dollars 
due to the concentration of international sales and the manufacturing capacity in europe and asia  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally 
these risks include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and fluctuations in the us dollar that could increase the sales price in local currencies of our products in international markets  or make it difficult for us to obtain price reductions from our foundries 
we do not currently engage in any hedging activities to reduce our exposure to exchange rate risks 
if and when we engage in transactions in foreign currencies  our results of operations could be adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales to asia pacific region 
this region of the world is subject to increased levels of economic instability  and this instability could seriously harm our results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market of our common stock has been subject to significant volatility 
this volatility is expected to continue 
the following factors  among others  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock our announcement of the introduction of new products  our competitors announcements of the introduction of new products  and market conditions in the technology  entertainment and emerging growth company sectors 
the stock market has experienced  and is currently experiencing  volatility that particularly affects the market prices of equity securities of many high technology and development stage companies  such as those in the electronics industry 
this volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  could decrease the price of our common stock 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expense during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  and inventories 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition revenues mainly consist of product and development revenue 
revenues from product sales to oems  distributors and end users are generally recognized upon shipment  as our shipping terms are fob shipping point  except that revenues are deferred when we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of returns or where collectibility is not assured 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when collection subsequently becomes probable and returns are estimable generally upon resale by customers or sell through basis 
allowances for sales returns  price protection and warranty costs are recorded at the time that revenues are recognized 
in fiscal  we began recognizing revenue from our primary us distributor on a sell through basis 
this practice resulted from significant sales returns  which we accepted from the distributor outside of the terms of our distribution agreement 
under terms of a distribution agreement entered into with the distributor in fiscal  we have granted the distributor the right of return and price protection  which allows the distributor to return any product  which is in the original packaging  for full credit up to days after the earlier of the agreement expiration or early termination 
the price protection provision allows the distributor to receive a credit for the difference between the original price and the reduced price of our products within their inventory 
although the returns are not frequent in nature  we have not been reasonably able to estimate returns from this distributor regarding our video networking products 
consequently  pursuant to our above policy  revenue from this distributor is recognized upon resale to the distributor s end customers 
revenues from product development agreements were recognized in fiscal when billed and collection was assured as compared to the percentage of completion method in fiscal the change in method was due to extensions in development schedules that subsequently arose 
under the percentage of completion method  estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts 
any revisions are recorded in the accounting period in which the need for revisions becomes evident 
we classify all development costs related to such agreements as research and development expenses 
development revenues were   and million  for fiscal  and  respectively 
accounts receivable during industry downturns  certain of our customers have difficulty with their cash flows 
certain customers  typically those with whom we have long term relationships  may delay their payments by days beyond the original terms 
we review the ability of our customers to pay the indebtedness they incur with us 
we defer recognition of revenue and the related receivable when we cannot reasonably estimate whether collectibility is assured at the time products and services are delivered to our customer 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding credit worthiness 
in fiscal  and  we recorded a provision for general and specific bad debt allowance in the total amount of   and million respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we continue to monitor our inventory levels in light of product development changes and expectations of an eventual market upturn 
we may be required to take additional charges for excess and obsolete inventories if the current industry downturn extends further into the future than we have currently estimated or we make changes in our current product development plans 
we estimate inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessments of future product sales giving consideration for factors such as the cyclical nature of our industry 
these forecasts require us to estimate our ability to see demand for current and future products and compare those estimates with our current inventory levels 
if these forecasts or estimates change adversely  or our product roadmaps change  then we would need further write down inventory 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company adopted the disclosure requirements of fin effective december  as the company did not have any material guarantees outstanding  the issuance of fin did not have an effect on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decision with respect to stock based employee compensation  and requires disclosure about those effects in both annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company does not expect to change to using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and therefore  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we face exposure to market risk from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our operations and financial condition 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
at january   we did not hold any short term investments generally consisting of the us government and corporate debt securities with an average original maturity of less than one year 
at january   we had million outstanding under a million variable interest rate bank line of credit  no borrowings outstanding under our million and million variable interest rate bank lines of credit and utilized  of a standby letter of credit under the second line of credit 
if short term interest rates were to increase percent  the increased interest expense associated with these arrangements would not have a material impact on our net income and cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity 
the hong kong dollar and euro are the financial currencies of our subsidiaries in hong kong and france 
we do not currently enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures and intercompany balances against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
however  we do maintain cash balances denominated in the hong kong dollar and euro 
if foreign exchange rates were to weaken against the us dollar immediately and uniformly by percent from the exchange rate at january   the fair value of these foreign currency amounts would decline by an immaterial amount
