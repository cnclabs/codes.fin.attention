table of contents aggressiveness of the plaintiff s bar  and the declining defendant base as a result of business failures  has also led to a trend of larger payments and settlements per claim

foreign currency translation in the past the company had been exposed to foreign currency translation risk due to its mexican operations 
since the company has discontinued its mexican operations it no longer has exposure to these risks 
impact of inflation the company reflects price escalations in its quotations to its insulation customers and in its estimation of costs for materials and labor 
for construction contracts based on a cost plus or time and materials basis  the effect of inflation on the company is negligible 
for projects on a fixed price basis  the effect of inflation may result in reduced profit margin or a loss as a result of higher costs to the company as the contracts are completed  however  the majority of the company s contracts are completed within months of their commencement and the company believes that the impact of inflation on such contracts is insignificant 
significant accounting policies our critical accounting policies are those both having the most impact to the reporting of our financial condition and results  and requiring significant judgments and estimates 
our critical accounting policies include those related to a revenue recognition  b investment  at cost and c allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
revenue recognition for fixed price insulation installation and asbestos abatement contracts are accounted for by the percentage of completion method wherein costs and estimated earnings are included in revenues as the work is performed 
if a loss on a fixed price contract is indicated  the entire amount of the estimated loss is accrued when known 
the investment at less than of ownership is 
table of contents recorded at cost and the carrying value is evaluated quarterly 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
future changes in the financial condition of a customer may require an adjustment to the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the fair value of the company s investments in available for sale securities at december  was approximately  the company s investment policy is to manage its available for sale securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio 
the principal available for sale securities are shares of surg ii  inc stock and medstone international  inc 
stock 
specific changes in the value of the common stock of surg ii  inc and medstone international  inc will affect the fair value of the available for sale securities portfolio  however  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold 
in december  the company loaned  to an individual who eventually became an officer and director of the company 
the loan was made without recourse  and is secured by  shares of the company s common stock and any dividends payable or received related to the  shares of common stock  which currently includes  shares of chiral quest  inc otcbb cqst 
since the loan is without recourse to the borrower  as the market price of the company s and chiral quest  inc s stock fluctuates  the carrying value of the loan receivable will change 
as of december   the company had recorded a reserve of  related to the market fluctuations of the company s and chiral quest  inc s common stock trading value 
additional changes in the market value could result in additional reductions of the notes receivable carrying value 
the company s long term debt and mortgage payable are subject to interest rate risk since the interest rate is not a fixed rate 
the company does not expect any fluctuations in the interest rates to have a material effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations
