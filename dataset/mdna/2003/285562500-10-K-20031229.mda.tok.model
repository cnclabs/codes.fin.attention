we derive the majority of our revenues from two main business segments  bankcard and transaction processing services bank card services  whereby we provide solutions to merchants and banks to allow them to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers  and check related products check services  whereby we provide various services to merchants and banks to allow them to accept and process check payments from consumers 
the principal services we offer within these two segments include  with respect to our bank card services  debit and credit card processing  and with respect to our check services  check guarantee  check verification  electronic check conversion  check re presentment  and check collection

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  deferred taxes  reserve for doubtful accounts  goodwill amortization  capitalization of software costs  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management applies the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
we earn revenue from services which include the following debit and credit card processing  check guarantee  check verification  check conversion  check re presentment  check collection and inventory tracking 
all of these services are performed pursuant to a contract with customers  which states the terms and fixed price for all contracted services 
the price of a service may be a fixed fee for each transaction verification  conversion and check guarantee and or a percentage of the transaction processed check guarantee  depending on the service 
we generally collect our fee at the time we process the transaction and accordingly  collectibility is assured 
based on our underwriting criteria and ongoing credit monitoring of customers  collectibility on service transactions is reasonably assured 
revenue from debit and credit card collectively called bankcards and transaction processing revenue is based on a percentage of the transaction value  commonly referred to as a discount fee on a credit and debit card transaction processed by us 
in addition  there is a per transaction fee associated with each bankcard transaction which is charged to the merchant 
we recognize the processing and transaction revenue when the services are performed 
revenue from check guarantee is derived from a percentage of the gross amount of the check and guarantees payment of the check to the merchant in the event the check is not honored by the check writer s bank 
merchants typically present customer checks for processing on a regular basis and  therefore  dishonored checks are generally identified within a few days of the date the checks are guaranteed by us 
we recognize revenue when the checks are processed at the point of sale 
at the time the guarantee revenue is recognized  we provide a reserve for estimated guarantee losses based upon our historical loss experience 
in the event the check is dishonored  we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the check writer but have historically recovered approximately of the guaranteed checks 
we establish a receivable from the delinquent check writer for the full amount of the guaranteed check 
the check guarantee service also earns revenue based on fees collected from delinquent check writers  which collection fee is recognized when collected  as collectibility is not reasonably assured until that point 
revenue from check verification is derived from fees collected from the merchants when a check is verified against our positive and negative check database 
this revenue is recognized when the transaction is processed  since we have no further performance obligations 
revenue from check conversion is derived from fees collected from merchants to convert the paper check received by merchants into an ach transaction  which allows us to settle the transaction electronically for the merchant 
we recognize the revenue related to check conversion fees when the services are performed 
revenue from check re presentment is derived from fees charged to check writers 
check re presentment is a service that allows merchants to collect a paper check through the automated clearing house ach network after a check has previously been presented to the bank for collection unsuccessfully at least once 
the fees earned from the check writer are recognized when collected  as collectibility is not reasonably assured until that point 
revenue from check collection is derived from collection activities performed on behalf of a merchant on uncollected checks 
the merchants usually keep the face amount of the uncollected checks if the collection effort is successful 
our revenue is derived from the collection fee collected from the check writer 
if we refer the collection item to another collection agency  we will receive a fee from the collection agency upon its successful efforts 
collection fee revenue is recognized when collected  as collectibility is not reasonably assured until that point 
revenue from inventory tracking is derived from transaction fees for processing and tracking u haul s daily inventory activities 
this revenue is recognized when the transaction is processed  since we have no further performance obligations 
deferred taxes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  management considers estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
chargeback losses 
chargeback losses occur when a credit card holder presents a valid claim against one of our merchants and the merchant has insufficient funds or is no longer in business resulting in the charge being absorbed by us 
we record a receivable for those chargebacks for which the merchant is liable but has not made payment 
we record a provision for estimated chargeback losses at the time bankcard transactions are processed 
a reserve is estimated based upon a historically determined percentage of gross credit card processing volume and actual losses experienced 
research and development expense 
expenditures for research activities relating to product development and improvement are charged to expense as incurred 
such expenditures amounted to  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually using a fair value based approach 
in the year of adoption  sfas no 
also requires us to perform an initial assessment of its reporting units to determine whether there is any indication that the goodwill carrying value may be impaired 
this transitional assessment is made by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit  as determined in accordance with the new standard  to its book value 
to the extent the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its book value  which would indicate that potential impairment of goodwill exists  a second transitional test is required to determine the amount of impairment 
in  we determined that our goodwill was impaired under sfas no 
and accordingly took a charge to write down the amount of that impairment 
capitalization of software costs 
the costs of purchased and internally developed software used to provide services to customers or for the process of internal administration are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or estimated useful life 
under the provisions of statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  we capitalize software costs when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management has authorized further funding for the completion of the project 
capitalization of costs ceases when the project is substantially complete and the software is ready for its intended use 
software developed or obtained for internal use is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstance indicates that its carrying amount may not be recoverable

the bankcard and transaction processing revenue increase was mainly attributable to an approximate increase in bankcard processing volume as compared to last fiscal year 
this increase was also affected by a rate adjustment to the bankcard merchant base during fiscal and the fact that we continue to grow our bankcard processing business organically through our various sales and marketing programs 
the check related processing revenue increase was attributable to a increase in check verification revenue and a increase in electronic check conversion and electronic check presentment revenue

additionally  it was attributable to the transactions generated by the visa program 
terminal sales decreased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal during fiscal  u haul stopped sending its terminals to us for repair 
we have gradually shut down our terminal deployment operations during fiscal cost of sales 
bankcard processing expenses are directly related to the changes in processing revenue 
a majority of our bankcard processing expenses are fixed costs and reflected as a percentage of the total face amount of each bankcard transaction  and the remaining costs are based on a fixed rate applied to the number of transactions processed 
processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense and transaction and check processing expense  increased for the year  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase reflects a increase in processing and transaction revenues for the year

other operating costs such as personnel costs  telephone and depreciation expenses increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal primarily due to the increase in revenue 
research and development expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  as most of our development projects have entered into coding and testing phases 
we need to continue to invest in research and development in both the bankcard processing business segment and the check related products segment in order to remain competitive in this financial services market  given that the technology in this industry changes rapidly 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was mainly due to the addition of management personnel to support our continuous growth  the increase in employee benefits costs such as medical insurance  workers compensation insurance and the increase in cost of living adjustments 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from in the fiscal to in fiscal amortization of goodwill expense was eliminated in fiscal due to the implementation of sfas no

effective tax rate 
the income tax provision was  for fiscal as compared to an income taxes benefit of  for fiscal our effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal and a tax provision rate was for fiscal see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for further explanation of the income tax expense and a reconciliation of reported income taxes to the amount utilizing the statutory rate 
net loss

for the year ended september   merchantamerica  our primary generator of bankcard process and transaction revenue  accounted for approximately of our revenues  compared to in fiscal bankcard processing and transaction revenue increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to an approximate increase in bankcard processing volume as compared to last fiscal year 
this increase was also affected by a rate adjustment to our bankcard merchant base during fiscal and the fact that we continue to grow our bankcard processing business organically through our various sales and marketing programs 
in fiscal  the bankcard and transaction processing segment generated operating income of  or of the related revenues  as compared to  or of the related revenues in fiscal this increase in operating income was reflective of the increase in revenue and the higher gross margin as a result of the rate adjustment to merchants and the lower chargeback losses 
we purchased a fully integrated  multi modular bankcard processing system from oasis technology in for approximately million 
this oasis system is expected to reduce a key component of our cost structure by eliminating a third party processor  a savings of approximately ten basis points for every credit card dollar processed 
the implementation of this system will give us greater flexibility to price our credit card processing services  allowing us to attract and retain larger merchants as well as the small and mid market merchants that have been our target market 
this project was expected to be completed by the last quarter of  however  due to vendor software delivery delays  management now anticipates that portions of the oasis system will begin productive use in early and be fully implemented in late check related products 
check related revenues increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal  an increase of 
check verification revenue increased to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal check conversion and check re presentment revenue increased to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal additionally  check collection revenue increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the high growth in the check conversion revenue was due to the increasing market acceptance of this product and attributable to the transaction revenue generated by the visa program 
check services revenue made up of the total processing and transaction revenues for fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
check related operating income was  for fiscal  as compared to operating loss of  in fiscal the increase in operating income was mainly due to the increase in check related revenues 
the visa program is continuing to expand and is starting to gain market acceptance 
we are currently working with ten visa member banks that have signed up to participate in this visa program 
one of the visa acquiring banks  using us as the third party processor  rolled out this program to a national retailer in june this one merchant has tripled the number of ach transactions generated by us from may to june as a result of this merchant deployment and the anticipated growth  we had to increase the level of customer support staff and also increased our overall network infrastructure to support such growth 
at the present time  the visa program is beginning to generate a significant portion of our total check related revenue 
management believes that the visa program will provide us with numerous opportunities to develop strategic relationships with the banks who have chosen us to be their third party processor and acquirer processor under the visa program 
these relationships could play a major role in increasing our check services revenue in the coming years 
fiscal years and financial highlights for fiscal as compared to fiscal were as follows total revenue increased to million gross margin from processing and transaction revenue declined to from operating income moved into negative territory to million from diluted loss per share of as compared to diluted earnings per share of fiscal results reflect one time legal settlement of million bankcard and transaction processing revenue rose to million check related revenue increased by to million revenue 
total revenue increased to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributed to growth in the processing and transaction business 
total processing and transaction revenue for fiscal increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to a increase in bankcard processing volume and increase in bankcard processing and transaction revenue as compared to the prior year 
this was due to our merchants organic growth and the success in our marketing strategy 
in addition  check related revenue increased as our ach services and check presentment services started to gain market acceptance 
cost of sales 
bankcard processing expenses are largely a reflection of changes in processing revenue 
a majority of our bankcard processing expenses are fixed as a percentage of each transaction amount  with the remaining costs being based on a fixed rate applied to the transactions processed 
processing related expenses  consisting of bankcard processing expense and transaction and check processing expense  increased during fiscal  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase reflected a increase in processing and transaction revenues for the year  as well as the higher costs of processing 
gross margin from processing and transaction services decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease in gross margin was due to a combination of factors  including most significantly  higher personnel and infrastructure costs  as well as  increased costs paid to a third party service provider  the departure of several higher volume high margin credit card merchants  and a lower rate charged to u haul as a result of a contract negotiation 
while bankcard and transaction processing revenue increased by in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  cost of sales such as personnel costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
additionally  depreciation and amortization expense related to computer software and hardware increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a increase 
over the past couple of years  we have capitalized  of software development costs and computer equipment  which are being amortized over its useful lives 
this was primarily attributable to the increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
cost of terminals sold was  during fiscal  as compared to  in fiscal the cost of terminals continued to exceed the terminal sales as a result of a  inventory allowance provision for fiscal this allowance was related to the write down of certain obsolete customized printers and other slow moving inventory 
expense 
other operating costs such as personnel costs  telephone and depreciation expenses decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to stringent cost controls instituted by us 
research and development expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal because we continued to invest in research and development related to our various check service products 
additionally  we incurred operational expenses related to the management of the visa program without any offsetting revenue during this period 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was mainly due to the hiring of additional sales personnel in support of both merchant and check services and additional administrative staff to support our growth 
in fiscal  we hired a new coo cio 
as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal amortization of goodwill expense remained relatively constant  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased to  for fiscal  from  in fiscal the increase was due to the million long term note portion of the legal settlement expense related to a lawsuit settled in fiscal  which carries an interest rate 
interest income declined from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to a decline in interest rates and lower average cash balances 
effective tax rate 
benefit for income taxes of  in fiscal was due to the operating loss incurred of  our effective tax benefit rate was for fiscal and a tax provision rate of for fiscal see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for further explanation of the income tax expense and a reconciliation of reported income taxes to the amount utilizing the statutory rate 
net income loss 
net loss for fiscal was  as compared to net income of  in fiscal the decline was primarily due to the million legal settlement on a pre tax basis 
we made a one time cash payment of  to the plaintiff in the lawsuit and executed a long term promissory note collateralized by our agoura hills  california office building in favor of that plaintiff for an additional  payable over years  with an interest rate of 
additionally  we incurred approximately  in legal fees defending the lawsuit in fiscal not including the million legal settlement and the legal fees paid  net loss would have been  in fiscal in addition  operating income fell in fiscal primarily due to a  increase in research and development expense  a  increase in provision for inventory allowance and a  decrease in other revenue 
segment results bankcard and transaction processing 
bankcard processing and transaction revenue increased  from  in fiscal to  for fiscal this increase was mainly attributable to an approximately increase in bankcard processing volume as compared to and was the result of our successful marketing programs  including the merchantamerica web offerings and other sales programs 
the increase in bankcard processing revenue was partially offset by a decrease in revenue as a result of a rate reduction offered to u haul  a major transaction processing customer  and the loss of several high volume  high margin merchants 
in fiscal  the bankcard and transaction processing segment generated operating income of  or of associated revenues  as compared to  or of revenues  in fiscal the decrease in operating income is attributable to a  increase in research and development expense  a  increase in inventory allowance and a  decrease in other revenue 
additionally  gross margin decreased due to the departure of several high margin merchants combined with higher overall operating costs 
we implemented a rate increase in october to our credit card processing merchants  which was expected to offset the higher operating costs and to improve the gross margin from credit card processing activities in fiscal check related products 
check related revenues increased from  for fiscal to  an increase of 
this was attributable to a increase in check verification revenue and a increase in electronic check conversion and electronic check presentment revenue 
check services revenue made up of the total processing and transaction revenues for fiscal as compared to in the prior year 
check related operating loss was  in fiscal  as compared to operating loss of  in fiscal the increase was due to the costs associated with the development of the visa program and our other products  as well as an increase in staffing to support current and anticipated processing volume 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had available cash and cash equivalents of  restricted cash of  in reserve with our primary processing banks and working capital of  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  increased to  at september  from  at the end of fiscal this increase in accounts receivable was attributable to the higher billings generated at the end of the fiscal year due to increases in processing volume and the number of customers in general  which drove our revenue growth 
allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects chargeback losses and dues to visa and mastercard decreased to  at the end of fiscal from  at september  this decrease was due to the write off of accounts receivable  which were deemed to be uncollectible 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  was  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for fiscal the increase in cash from operations was primarily attributable to the  increase in operating income between fiscal and  and an increase in net settlement payable of  as of september  settlement payable as of september  was  as compared to  at september  settlement payable results from timing differences in our settlement process with merchants 
these timing differences account for the difference between the time that funds are received in our bank accounts and the time that settlement payments are made to merchants 
therefore  at any given time  settlement payable may vary and ultimately depends on the volume of transactions processed 
the increase in settlement payable in fiscal is primarily attributable to the high volume of transactions experienced from our check services 
as our business grows  settlement payable will likely increase 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal as compared to  for fiscal year during fiscal  we used  for purchases of equipment and capitalized software costs as compared to  for fiscal we anticipate the need to build a more robust infrastructure in order to support the level of transaction growth in the coming years 
additionally  we are in the process of strengthening our business continuation plan and disaster recovery sites  all of which will require substantial capital investments in fiscal we also need to continue to invest in software development costs in fiscal to remain competitive 
net cash used by financing activities was  for the current fiscal year as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  for fiscal year during fiscal  we received  from the issuance of notes payable to fund certain payments for the oasis system 
we used  for the repayment of capitalized leases and notes payable 
we also received  from the exercise of employee stock options 
in light of our significant capital requirements anticipated in  during october  we completed a million private equity placement with several institutional investors 
this equity financing raised approximately  of net proceeds to us 
additionally  as of november  we negotiated a  equipment lease line and a  credit line with bank of the west for working capital needs 
at september   we had the following cash commitments payment due by period contractual less than after obligations total year years years years long term debt including interest      capital lease obligations    operating leases     total contractual cash obligations      our primary source of liquidity is expected to be cash flow generated from operations and cash and cash equivalents currently on hand 
management believes that our cash flow from operations together with cash on hand  our lease line  our established line of credit with bank of the west  and cash received from our private placement financing will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other commitments 
risk factors we are subject to a number of risks  which could affect operating results and liquidity  including  among others  the following risks related to our business we rely on cooperative relationships with  and sponsorship by  banks  the absence of which may affect our operations 
we currently rely on cooperative relationships with  and sponsorship by  banks in order to process our visa  mastercard and other bankcard transactions 
we also rely on several banks for access to the automated clearing house ach for submission of both credit card and check settlements 
our banking relationships are currently with smaller banks with assets of less than 
even though smaller banks tend to be more susceptible to mergers or acquisitions and are therefore less stable  these banks find the programs we offer more attractive and we believe we cannot obtain similar relationships with larger banks at this time 
a bank could at any time curtail or place restrictions on our processing volume because of its internal business policies or due to other adverse circumstances 
if a volume restriction is placed on us  it could materially adversely affect our business operations by restricting our ability to process credit card transactions and receive the related revenue 
our relationships with our customers and merchants would also be adversely affected by our inability to process these transactions 
we currently maintain one primary bankcard processing and sponsorship relationship with first regional bank in agoura hills  california 
our agreement with first regional bank continues through additionally  we have reached a tentative agreement with woodforest bank in woodforest  texas  to sponsor our bankcard activity 
once finalized  we expect this agreement will continue through we also maintain several banking relationships for ach processing 
while we believe our current bank relationships are sound  we cannot assure that these banks will not restrict our increasing processing volume or that we will always be able to maintain these relationships or establish new banking relationships 
even if new banking relationships are available  they may not be on terms acceptable to us 
with respect to first regional bank and woodforest bank  while we believe their respective ability to terminate our respective relationships is cost prohibitive  they may independently determine that the cost of terminating their agreements is less than the cost of continuing to perform in accordance with their terms  and may therefore determine to terminate those agreements prior to their expiration 
ultimately  our failure to maintain these banking relationships and sponsorships may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
merchant fraud with respect to bankcard and ach transactions could cause us to incur significant losses 
we significantly rely on the processing revenue derived from bankcard and ach transactions 
if any merchants were to submit or process unauthorized or fraudulent bankcard or ach transactions  depending on the dollar amount  echo could incur significant losses which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
echo assumes and compensates the sponsoring bank for bearing the risk of these types of transactions 
we have implemented systems and software for the electronic surveillance and monitoring of fraudulent bankcard and ach use 
as of september   we maintained a dedicated chargeback reserve of  at our primary bank specifically earmarked for such activity 
additionally  through our sponsoring bank  we had access to approximately million in merchant deposits to cover any potential chargeback losses 
despite a long history of managing such risk  we cannot guarantee that these systems will prevent fraudulent transactions from being submitted and processed or that the funds set aside to address such activity will be adequate to cover all potential situations that might occur 
we do not have insurance to protect us from these losses 
there is no assurance that our chargeback reserve will be adequate to offset against any unauthorized or fraudulent processing losses that we may incur 
depending on the size of such losses  our results of operations could be immediately and materially adversely affected 
failure to participate in the visa pos check service program would cause us to significantly shift our operating and marketing strategy 
we have significantly increased our infrastructure  personnel and marketing strategy to focus on the potential growth of our check services through the visa pos check service program 
we currently provide critical back end infrastructure for the service  including our ncn database for verification and our access to the federal reserve system s automated clearing house for funds settlement  and for checks written on bank accounts with banks not participating in the program 
because we believe the market will continue to gain acceptance of the visa pos check service program  we have expended significant resources to market our check conversion services and verification services to our merchant base  to solidify our strategic relationships with the various financial institutions that have chosen us as their acquirer processor and third party processor under the program  and to sell our other check products such as electronic check re presentments and check guarantee to the visa member banks 
we have also increased our personnel to handle the increased volume of transactions arising directly from our participation in the program 
if we fail to adequately market our services through this relationship  this could materially affect our marketing strategy going forward 
additionally  if we fail to adequately grow our infrastructure to address increases in the volume of transactions  cease providing services as a third party processor or acquirer processor or are otherwise removed or terminated from the visa program  this would require us to dramatically shift our current operating strategy 
the business in which we compete is highly competitive and there is no assurance that our current products and services will stay competitive or that we will be able to introduce new products and services to compete successfully 
we are in the business of processing payment transactions and designing and implementing integrated systems for our customers so that they can better use our services 
this business is highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  rapid rates of product obsolescence  and rapid rates of new products introduction 
our market share is relatively small as compared to most of our competitors and most of these competitors have substantially more financial and marketing resources to run their businesses 
while we believe our small size provides us the ability to move quickly in some areas  our competitors greater resources enable them to investigate and embrace new and emerging technologies  quickly to respond to changes in customers needs  and to devote more resources to product and services development and marketing 
we may face increased competition in the future and there is no assurance that current or new competition will allow us to keep our customers 
if we lose customers  our business operations may be materially adversely affected  which could cause us to cease our business or curtail our business to a point where we are no longer able to generate sufficient revenues to fund operations 
there is no assurance that our current products and services will stay competitive with those of our competitors or that we will be able to introduce new products and services to compete successfully in the future 
if we are unable to process significantly increased volume activity  this could affect our operations and we could lose our competitive position 
we have built transaction processing systems for check verification  check conversion  ach processing  and bank card processing activities 
while current estimates regarding increased volume are within the capabilities of each system  it is possible that a significant increase in volume in one of the markets would exceed a specific system s capabilities 
to minimize this risk  echo has redesigned and upgraded its check related processing systems and has purchased a high end system to process bankcard activity 
this system is not yet operational  and even when it becomes operational  no assurance can be given that it would be able to handle a significant increase in volume or that the operational enhancements and improvements will be completed in such time to avoid such a situation 
in the event we are unable to process increases in volume  this could significantly adversely affect our banking relationships  our merchant customers  and our overall competitive position  and could potentially result in violations of service level agreements which would require us to pay penalty fees to the other parties to those agreements 
losses of such relationships  or the requirement to pay penalties  may severely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we incur financial risk from our check guarantee service 
the check guarantee business is essentially a risk management business 
any limitation of a risk management system could result in financial obligations being incurred by echo relative to our check guarantee activity 
while echo has provided check guarantee services for several years  there can be no assurance that our current risk management systems are adequate to assure against any financial loss relating to check guarantee 
echo is enhancing its current risk management systems and it is being conservative with reference to the type of merchants to which it offers guarantee services in order to minimize this risk but no assurance can be given that such measures will be adequate 
during the year ended september   we incurred  in losses from uncollected guaranteed checks 
security breaches could impact our continued operations 
we process confidential financial information and maintain several levels of security to protect this data 
security includes hand and card based identification systems at our data center locations that restrict access to the specific facilities  various employee monitoring and access restriction policies  and various firewall and network management methodologies that restrict unauthorized access through the internet 
while these systems have worked effectively in the past  there can be no assurance that they will continue to operate without a security breach in the future 
depending upon the nature of the breach  the consequences of security breaches could be significant and dramatic to echo s continued operations 
the industry in which we operate involves rapidly changing technology and our failure to improve our products and services or to offer new products and services could cause us to lose customers 
our business industry involves rapidly changing technology 
recently  we have observed rapid changes in technology as evidenced by the internet and internet related services and applications  new and better software  and faster computers and modems 
as technology changes  echo s customers desire and expect better products and services 
our success depends on our ability to improve our existing products and services and to develop and market new products and services 
the costs and expenses associated with such an effort could be significant to us 
there is no assurance that we will be able to find the funds necessary to keep up with new technology or that if such funds are available that we can successfully improve our existing products and services or successfully develop new products and services 
our failure to provide improved products and services to our customers or any delay in providing such products and services could cause us to lose customers to our competitors 
loss of customers could have a material adverse effect on echo 
our inability to protect or defend our trade secrets and other intellectual property could hurt our business 
we have expended a considerable amount of time and money to develop information systems for our merchants 
we regard these information systems as trade secrets that are extremely important to our payment processing operations 
we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality and or license agreements with employees  customers  partners and others to protect this intellectual property and have not otherwise taken steps to obtain additional intellectual property protection or other protection on these information systems 
we cannot be certain that we have taken adequate steps to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  our third party confidentiality agreements can be breached and  if they are  there may not be an adequate remedy available to us 
if our trade secrets become known  we may lose our competitive position  including the loss of our merchant and bank customers 
such a loss could severely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  while we believe that the technology underlying our information systems does not infringe upon the rights of any third parties  there is no assurance that third parties will not bring infringement claims against us 
we also have the right to use the technology of others through various license agreements 
if a third party claimed our activities and or these licenses were infringing their technology  while we may have some protection from our third party licensors  we could face additional infringement claims or otherwise be obligated to stop utilizing intellectual property critical to our technology infrastructure 
if we are not able to implement other technology to substitute the intellectual property underlying a claim  our business operations could be severely effected 
additionally  infringement claims would require us to incur significant defense costs and expenses and  to the extent we are unsuccessful in defending these claims  could cause us to pay monetary damages to the person or entity making the claim 
continuously having to defend such claims or otherwise making monetary damages payments could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
if we do not continue to invest in research and development  we could lose our competitive position 
because technology in the payment processing industry evolves rapidly  we need to continue to invest in research and development in both the bankcard processing business segment and the check related products segment in order to remain competitive 
although research and development expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  because of the fact that most of our development project costs were capitalized once we entered into coding and testing phases  we continue to evaluate projects  which we believe will assist us in our efforts to stay competitive 
although we believe that our investment in these projects will ultimately increase earnings  there is no assurance as to when or if these new products will show profitability or if we will ever be able to recover the costs invested in these projects 
additionally  if we fail to commit adequate resources to grow our technology on pace with market growth  we could quickly lose our competitive position  including the loss of our merchant and bank customers 
failure to obtain additional funds can impact our operations and future growth 
we use funds generated from operations  as well as funds obtained through credit facilities and equity financing  to finance our operations 
in light of our recent financing efforts  and as a result of the cash flow generated from operations  we believe we have sufficient cash to support our business activities  including research  development and marketing costs 
however  future growth may depend on our ability to continue to raise additional funds  either through operations  bank borrowings  or equity or debt financings 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise the funds necessary to finance growth or continue to generate the funds necessary to finance operations  and even if such funds are available  that the terms will be acceptable to us 
the inability to generate the necessary funds from operations or from third parties in the future may require us to scale back our research  development and growth opportunities  which could harm our overall operations 
while we maintain insurance protection against claims related to our services  there is no assurance that such protection will be adequate to cover potential claims and our inability to otherwise pay such claims could harm our business 
we maintain errors and omissions insurance for the services we provide 
while we believe the limit on our errors and omissions insurance policy is adequate and consistent with industry practice  if claims are brought by our customers or other third parties  we could be required to pay the required claim or make significant expenditures to defend against such claims in amounts that exceed our current insurance coverage 
there is no assurance that we will have the money to pay potential plaintiffs for such claims if they arise beyond the amounts insured by us 
making these payments could have a material adverse effect on our business 
involvement in litigation could harm our business 
we are involved in various lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
although we believe that the claims asserted in such lawsuits are without merit  the cost to us for the fees and expenses to defend such lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will not at some time in the future experience significant liability in connection with such claims 
as of september   we have spent approximately  in legal fees and expenses defending these claims 
litigation costs and expenses  including the cost to settle claims  significantly affected our results of operations during the year ended september  net loss for fiscal was  as compared to net income of  in fiscal the decline was primarily due to a million legal settlement paid to premiere lifestyles international corporation  inc in connection with the settlement  we made a one time cash payment of  to premier and executed a long term promissory note collateralized by our agoura hills  california office building in favor of that plaintiff for an additional  payable over years  with an interest rate of 
additionally  we incurred approximately  in legal fees in connection with the suit of which  were incurred in fiscal our inability to recover from natural disasters could harm our business 
we currently maintain four data centers one in agoura hills  california  one in camarillo  california  one in albuquerque  new mexico and one in boulder  colorado 
should a natural disaster occur in any of the locations  it is possible that echo would not be able to fully recover full functionality at one of its data centers 
to minimize this risk  echo will centralize its data processing functionality in camarillo in and will make albuquerque a fully redundant site 
prior to that time  it is possible a natural disaster could limit or completely disable a specific service offered by echo until such time that the specific location could resume its functionality 
our inability to provide such service could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
increases in the costs of technical compliance could harm our business 
the services which echo offers require significant technical compliance 
this includes compliance to both visa and mastercard regulations and association rules  nacha guidelines and regulations with regard to the federal reserve system s automated clearing house and check related issues  and various banking requirements and regulations 
echo has personnel dedicated to monitoring our compliance to the specific industries we serve and  when possible  echo is moving the technical compliance responsibility to other parties  as is the case with the recent purchase of the oasis technologies bankcard processing system wherein the vendor  oasis technologies  assumes much of the compliance obligations regularly updated by visa and mastercard 
as the compliance issues become more defined in each industry  the costs associated with that compliance may present a risk to echo 
these costs could be in the form of additional hardware  software or technical expertise that echo must acquire and or maintain 
while echo currently has these costs under control  we have no control over those entities that set the compliance requirements so no assurance can be given that echo will always be able to underwrite the costs of compliance in each industry wherein we compete 
risks associated with our common stock if we need to sell or issue additional shares of common stock or assume additional debt to finance future growth  our stockholders ownership could be diluted or our earnings could be adversely impacted 
our business strategy may include expansion through internal growth  by acquiring complementary businesses or by establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers 
in order to do so  or to fund our other activities  we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders stock ownership 
we may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses related to goodwill and other tangible assets if we acquire another company and this could negatively impact our results of operations 
as of the date of this report  management has no plan to raise additional capital through the sale of securities and believes that our cash flow from operations together with cash on hand and our established line of credit with bank of the west will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other commitments 
we have adopted a number of anti takeover measures that may depress the price of our common stock 
our rights agreement  our ability to issue additional shares of preferred stock and some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to make an unsolicited takeover attempt of us 
these anti takeover measures may depress the price of our common stock by making it more difficult for third parties to acquire us by offering to purchase shares of our stock at a premium to its market price 
our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market  and there can be substantial volatility in the market price of our common stock 
over the course of the quarter ended september   the market price of our common stock has been as high as  which is the highest market price our common stock has had over the course of the year ended september   and as low as 
additionally  over the course of the year ended september   the market price of our common stock has been as low as 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including quarterly variations in operating results  operating results which vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors  changes in financial estimates  changes in market valuations of competitors  announcements by us or our competitors of a material nature  loss of one or more customers  additions or departures of key personnel  future sales of common stock and stock market price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  general political and economic conditions such as a recession  or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we have not paid and do not currently plan to pay dividends  and you must look to price appreciation alone for any return on your investment 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends  particularly in general downturns in the stock market 
we have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth  and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  your return on this investment likely depends on your selling our stock at a profit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are currently not exposed to any significant financial market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates or changes in interest rates and do not use derivative financial instruments 
all of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  in the future  we may enter into transactions in other currencies 
an adverse change in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes  assuming that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive
