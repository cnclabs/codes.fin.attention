page revenues 
consolidated revenues for the year ended december  declined million to compared to million for the year ended december  in  kcsr revenues declined million compared to  primarily as a result of lower coal and automotive revenues partially offset by higher revenues for all other major commodity groups 
the increase in revenues for certain commodity groups  including chemical and petroleum products  agricultural and mineral  paper and forest products and intermodal traffic  was driven by a combination of volume gains in certain commodities  increased length of haul and price improvements in key traffic lanes 
these revenue gains were partially offset by volume losses in certain commodities within these groups 
kcs management believes that revenues for these commodity groups would have improved even further during  but were adversely affected by lower carloadings arising from mcs related congestion 
see recent developments implementation of new management control system for further information 
revenue from other subsidiaries decreased approximately million year over year primarily due to demand driven volume declines related to the company s petroleum coke bulk handling facility 
the following discussion provides an analysis of kcsr revenues by commodity group 
chemical and petroleum 
for the year ended december   chemical and petroleum product revenues increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  these revenue increases were the result of a combination of higher traffic volumes for certain commodities within this business group as well as targeted rate increases and longer hauls due to gateway changes 
higher revenues for gases and organic products were primarily the result of production increases by certain customers  as well as changes in traffic patterns and targeted rate increases 
higher revenues for inorganic products were primarily the result of increased access to production facilities in geismar  louisiana as well as new business previously shipped by other rail carriers  which resulted in higher traffic volume 
increases in the production of pvc and plastic pellet products led to an increase in carloadings and higher revenues for plastic products 
these increases were partially offset by volume related declines in agrichemical and petroleum product revenues due to lower industrial production related to the continued slowdown in the us economy

these revenues were also higher due to certain rate increases and changes in traffic mix and length of haul 
declines in industrial production as a result of the continued slowdown in the us economy led to lower carloadings and revenues for pulpwood  logs  and chip products as well as metal products 
the decline in military and other carload revenues is a reflection of the effect of a significant one time military movement in targeted rate increases and changes in traffic patterns for metal products and pulpwood  logs and chips partially offset the related revenue decline resulting from lower traffic volumes for these commodities 
paper and forest products revenue accounted for and of carload revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
agricultural and mineral 
for the year ended december   revenues for agricultural and mineral product increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of higher revenues across all major products in the agricultural and mineral commodity group

see further discussion below 
compensation and benefits 
for the year ended december   consolidated compensation and benefits expense increased million to million compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of higher overtime and crew costs during the second half of related to the traffic congestion resulting from the third quarter implementation of mcs

in the first quarter of  the company incurred million in costs related to several significant derailments as well as the settlement of a personal injury claim 
derailment costs for the year ended december  were more normalized compared to also impacting the decrease in casualties and insurance expense was the receipt of million in legal and insurance settlements during expenses in for personal injury claims were slightly higher compared to the company s process of establishing liability reserves for these types of incidents is based upon an actuarial study by an independent outside actuary  a process followed by most large railroads 
car hire 
car hire expense for the year ended december  was relatively unchanged  decreasing only million to million compared to million for the year ended december  for the first half of  car hire expense decreased approximately million compared to the same period in as kcsr was operating a more efficient and well controlled railroad 
in early  an unusual number of significant derailments as discussed in casualties and insurance  as well as the effects of line washouts and flooding had a significant adverse impact on the efficiency of kcsr s operations in the first half of the resulting inefficiency led to congestion on kcsr during the first half of  which contributed to an increase in the number of freight cars from other railroads on the company s rail line 
for the second half of  car hire expense increased million compared to the second half of this increase was due to a higher number of freight cars from other railroads on the company s rail line as well as fewer kcsr freight cars on other railroads as a result of increased congestion resulting from the implementation of mcs in the third quarter of see recent developments implementation of new management control system

revenues 
consolidated revenues for the year ended december  totaled million compared to million for the year ended december  this million  or  increase resulted from higher kcsr revenues of approximately million coupled with higher revenues from certain other smaller subsidiaries 
the following discussion provides an analysis of kcsr revenues by commodity group 
chemical and petroleum 
for the year ended december   chemical and petroleum product revenues decreased million compared to the year ended december  higher revenues for plastic and inorganic chemical products were offset by declines in most other chemical products 
the increase in revenues for plastic products resulted from a plant expansion by a customer in late the decline in other chemical and petroleum products resulted primarily from lower industrial production reflecting the impact of the slowdown of the us economy 
these volume related revenue declines were somewhat mitigated through certain price increases taken in paper and forest 
revenues for paper and forest products decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of the transfer of certain national guard personnel and related equipment to a military base near kcsr s rail lines  military and other carloads increased million for the year ended december  additionally  for the year ended december   revenues for pulpwood and logchips increased million due to a fungus problem with logchips during which reduced revenues that has since been resolved 
these increases for the year ended december  were offset by declines in steel shipments and most other paper and forest product commodities 
contributing to the decline in certain lumber product revenues was an ongoing trade dispute between the united states and canada relating to softwood lumber producers  which has reduced certain lumber traffic between canada and mexico 
negotiations between the united states and canada are continuing in an effort to resolve this trade dispute 
steel shipments declined due to the loss of certain business and the timing of the receipt of steel shipments in compared to additionally  a significant portion of our steel shipments relate to drilling pipe for oil exploration 
drilling activity has declined due to the reductions in the price of oil  thus resulting in less demand for drilling pipe 
the continued decline in the us economy continues to affect the paper and forest product industry significantly as the need for raw materials in related page manufacturing and production industries decreased during certain price increases during have partially offset related volume declines 
agricultural and mineral 
agricultural and mineral product revenues decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  in  domestic grain revenues decreased million compared to primarily due to a general decline in the production of poultry in the united states  which decreased demand for grain deliveries to the company s poultry producing customers 
additionally  during the first half of  flooding in iowa and minnesota forced a temporary shift in the origination of some domestic grain shipments to illinois and indiana  resulting in significantly shorter hauls for kcsr 
export grain increased million compared to the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased shipments of soybeans for export through the ports of beaumont  texas and reserve  louisiana during the fourth quarter of annual declines in food products  ores and minerals and stone  clay and glass product revenues resulted primarily from the ongoing decline in the us and global economies 
intermodal and automotive 
for the year ended december   intermodal and automotive revenues increased million compared to the year ended december  as a result of an increase in automotive revenues of million partially offset by a decrease in intermodal revenues of million 
automotive revenues increased as a result of the following i mazda traffic originating at the international freight gateway ifg at the former richards gebaur airbase  located adjacent and connecting to kcsr s main line near kansas city  missouri  and ii ford business originating on the csx in louisville and interchanged with the kcsr in east st 
louis 
this ford automotive traffic was shipped to kansas city via kcsr and interchanged with union pacific railroad for delivery to the western united states 
during the third quarter of  kcsr lost this ford business due to competitive pricing from another rail carrier 
intermodal revenues for the year ended december  declined due to several factors  including i the impact of the slow down in the us economy  which has caused related declines in demand  ii customer erosion due to service delays arising from congestion experienced in the first quarter of  and iii a marketing agreement with norfolk southern  which provides that kcsr will perform haulage services for norfolk southern from meridian  mississippi to dallas  texas for an agreed upon haulage fee 
this marketing agreement was entered into in may and became fully operational in june a portion of the decline in intermodal revenues resulted from the norfolk southern haulage traffic that replaced existing intermodal revenues as kcsr is now receiving a smaller per unit haulage fee than the share of revenue it received as part of the intermodal movement 
the margins on this traffic are improved  however  because it has a lower cost base to kcsr as certain costs such as fuel and car hire are incurred and paid by norfolk southern 
coal 
for the year ended december   coal revenue increased million compared to the year ended december  these increases were primarily the result of higher demand from coal customers replenishing depleted stockpiles and to satisfy weather related demands as a result of hot weather conditions in the summer months 
net tons of unit coal shipped increased approximately for also contributing to the increase was the return of the kansas city power and light hawthorn plant to production in the second quarter of the hawthorn plant had been out of service since january due to an explosion at the kansas city facility 
other 
for the year ended december   other rail related revenues declined million  comprised of declines in switching and demurrage revenues of million and million  respectively  as well as declines in haulage revenues of million 
these declines related primarily to volume declines reflecting the weak economy 
demurrage revenues also declined due to more efficient fleet utilization resulting from a well operating railroad 
costs and expenses

compensation and benefits 
for the year ended december   consolidated compensation and fringe benefits expense declined million compared to the year ended december   resulting from a million reduction in costs for salaries and wages partially offset by an increase in fringe benefits expense of million 
this variance results primarily from a million reduction of compensation and fringe benefits at kcsr resulting from a reduction in page employee headcount arising from the workforce reduction discussed in significant developments cost reduction plan and lower costs associated with overtime due to improved operating efficiency 
fringe benefit costs were higher because of an approximate increase in health insurance costs and an increase in unemployment insurance partially offset by a decline in expenses associated with stock option exercises and a million reduction in retirement based costs for certain union employees 
the decline in compensation and fringe benefits expense was partially offset by the one time severance costs of approximately million associated with the workforce reduction 
depreciation and amortization 
consolidated depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in kcsr s asset base partially offset by property retirements and lower stb approved depreciation rates 
purchased services 
for the year ended december   purchased services expense increased million compared to the year ended december  this variance is comprised of a million decline in purchased services for kcsr offset by a million increase in purchased services for other subsidiaries 
the decline in purchased services for kcsr resulted from lower costs related to intermodal lift services and lower environmental compliance costs 
the decline in intermodal lift services was the result of a decline in the number of trailers handled at terminals combined with an increase in lift charges billed to others 
these declines in costs were partially offset by higher costs for locomotive and car repairs contracted to third parties as well as higher professional fees related to casualty claims 
the increase in purchased services related to other subsidiaries consists mostly of higher holding company costs and higher legal costs at a subsidiary related to the settlement of a lawsuit 
operating leases 
for the year ended december   consolidated operating lease expense decreased million compared to the year ended december  this decline was primarily the result of lower kcsr operating lease costs due to the expiration of certain leases for rolling stock that were not renewed due to better fleet utilization

for the year ended december   casualties and insurance expense increased million compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of higher casualties and insurance costs at kcsr of million 
excluding the impact of the duncan case settlement see significant developments duncan case settlement in  kcsr casualties and insurance costs would have increased million 
this resulted from an million increase in higher derailment costs related to several significant first quarter derailments and higher personal injury costs associated with third party claims 
also contributing to the fluctuation in casualties and insurance expense was an increase in the personal injury reserve of approximately million arising from the company s annual actuarial study 
during  the company changed its approach towards employee and third party personal injury liabilities by aggressively pursuing settlement of open claims 
the company s approach for many years prior to had been to challenge claimants and prolong litigation  thereby  in some cases management believes  increasing the long term costs of the incident 
this change in approach towards claim settlement led to substantial payments to claimants in approximating million for current and prior year casualty incidents  including the duncan case discussed earlier 
the company s process of establishment of liability reserves for these types of incidents is based upon an actuarial study by an independent outside actuary  a process followed by most large railroads 
the significant change in settlement philosophy in led to the need to establish additional reserves for personal injury liabilities as indicated by the annual actuarial study 
car hire 
for the year ended december   car hire expense increased million compared to the year ended december  an unusual number of significant first quarter derailments as discussed in casualties and insurance  as well as the effects of the economic slowdown  line washouts and flooding had an adverse impact on the efficiency of the company s us operations during the first quarter and early second quarter of the resulting inefficiency led to congestion on kcsr 
this congestion contributed to an increase in the number of freight cars from other railroads on the company s rail line  as well as a lower number of kcsr freight cars being used by other railroads  page resulting in an increase in car hire expense in compared to also contributing to the increase in car hire expense was the larger number of auto rack cars being used in compared to to serve the related increase in automotive traffic 
partially offsetting these effects were more efficient operations in the third and fourth quarters of  which led to a decline in the number of freight cars and trailers from other railroads and third parties on the company s rail line 
as operations continued to improve throughout the second half of  car hire costs also continued to improve  declining compared to the first half of other 
other operating expenses increased million year to year as a result of several factors 
the company recorded higher expenses associated with its petroleum coke bulk handling facility of approximately million resulting from a million expense related to a legal settlement and higher terminal operating costs 
additionally  in  the company recorded a million reduction to the allowance for doubtful accounts due to the collection of an outstanding receivable  which reduced other operating expenses in these variances resulting in increases to other operating expenses were partially offset by a decline in materials and supplies expense of approximately million 
additionally  in the company recorded million of gains on the sale of operating property compared to million in operating income and kcsr operating ratio 
consolidated operating income for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from a million increase in operating expenses partially offset by a million increase in revenues 
the operating income and operating ratio for kcsr improved to million and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to million and  respectively  for the year ended december  equity in net earnings losses of unconsolidated affiliates 
for the year ended december   the company recorded equity earnings of million compared to equity earnings of million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of higher equity earnings from grupo tfm of million and an increase in equity earnings from southern capital of million 
these increases were partially offset by a million decline in equity earnings from mexrail and equity losses of million recorded from pcrc relating mostly to costs associated with the start up of the business 
equity earnings related to grupo tfm increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   tfm recorded approximately million in pre tax income related to the reversion of certain concession assets to the mexican government 
the company s equity earnings for the year ended december  reflect it s proportionate share of this income of approximately million 
grupo tfm s revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  these higher revenues were partially offset by an approximate increase in operating expenses exclusive of the income related to the reversion of certain concession assets to the mexican government discussed above as well as other gains losses recorded on the sales of other operating assets resulting in a year to year decline in ongoing operating income of approximately 
under us gaap  the deferred tax expense for grupo tfm was million for the year ended december  compared to a deferred tax benefit of million for the year ended december  interest expense 
consolidated interest expense for the year ended december  declined million compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower interest rates libor on variable rate debt  a lower average debt balance and lower amortization related to debt issue costs 
also contributing to the decline in interest expense was million of capitalized interest recorded in relating to mcs

the company improved its profitability and reduced its debt during the first half of in spite of the continued downturn in the north american economy 
consolidated revenue for the first half of declined primarily as a result of slowdowns in the us economy as well as reduced coal revenues 
while the decline in revenues during the first half of adversely impacted operating results  the company s efforts to maintain it s cost structure were effective as operating income increased compared to the first half of however  from mid july to mid november  the company s operations were significantly impacted by congestion throughout it s us rail network and reduced operating efficiency related to the implementation of mcs see recent developments implementation of new management control system

as of december   all million was available under the revolver 
the new credit agreement contains  among other provisions  various financial covenants 
the company was in compliance with these provisions  including the financial covenants as of december  and expects to be in compliance throughout as a result of these financial covenants  the company s borrowings under the revolver may be restricted

as discussed in item  business rail network significant investments grupo tfm  grupo tmm and kcs  or either grupo tmm or kcs  could be required to purchase the mexican government s interest in tfm 
however  this provision is not exercisable prior to october  without the consent of grupo tfm 
if kcs and grupo tmm  or either kcs or grupo tmm alone had been required to purchase the mexican government s interest in tfm  the total purchase price would have been approximately million as of december  the company is exploring various alternatives for financing this transaction 
it is anticipated that this financing  if necessary  can be accomplished using the company s ability to access the capital markets 
no commitments for such financing have been obtained at this time 
in conjunction with exploring various alternatives for financing this transaction  the company anticipates requesting a waiver from existing financial covenants in the new credit agreement to provide flexibility in structuring the funding for this transaction 
although  the company s current cash position would allow it to meet its financial covenants as of march   management has decided to seek this waiver in order to permit the company to retain this cash pending its analysis of financing alternatives for this transaction

the sec declared the second shelf effective on june  securities in the aggregate amount of million remain available under the initial shelf and securities in the aggregate amount of million remains available under the second shelf

the company believes  based on current expectations  that its cash and other liquid assets  operating cash flows  access to capital markets  borrowing capacity  and other available financing resources are sufficient to fund anticipated operating  capital and debt service requirements and other commitments through see comment above with respect to purchase of mexican government s interest in tfm 
however  the company s operating cash flows and financing alternatives can be impacted by various factors  some of which are outside of the company s control 
for example  if the company were to experience a substantial reduction in revenues or a substantial increase in operating costs or other liabilities  its operating cash flows could be significantly reduced 
additionally  the company is subject to economic factors surrounding capital markets and the company s ability to obtain financing under reasonable terms is subject to market conditions 
further  the company s cost of debt can be impacted by independent rating agencies  which assign debt ratings based on certain credit measurements such as interest coverage and leverage ratios 
page critical accounting estimates the accounting and financial reporting policies of the company are in conformity with us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates discussed herein related to the recoverability and useful lives of assets as well as liabilities for litigation  environmental remediation  casualty claims  and income taxes with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s related disclosures herein 
depreciation of property  plant and equipment the railroad industry is extremely capital intensive 
plant maintenance and the depreciation of operating assets constitutes a substantial operating cost for the company  as well as the railroad industry as a whole 
the company capitalizes property  plant and equipment and depreciates it consistent with industry standards and rules established by the stb 
the cost of property  plant and equipment normally retired  less salvage value  is charged to depreciation expense over the estimated life of the operating assets using composite straight line rates for financial statement purposes 
the stb approves the depreciation rates used by kcsr excluding the amortization of computer software 
kcsr periodically conducts studies of depreciation rates for properties and equipment and implements approved changes  as necessary  to depreciation rates 
these studies take into consideration the historical retirement experience of similar assets  the current condition of the assets  current operations and potential changes in technology  estimated salvage value of the assets  and industry regulations 
for all other consolidated subsidiaries  depreciation is derived based upon the asset value in excess of estimated salvage value using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets for financial reporting purposes 
depreciation is based upon estimates of the useful lives of assets as well as their net salvage value at the end of their useful lives 
estimation of the useful lives of assets that are long lived as well as their salvage value requires significant management judgement 
accordingly  management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense are critical 
for the years ended december   and  no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to operating assets  the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation  or the methodology applied 
currently  the company depreciates its operating assets  including road and structures  rolling stock and equipment  and capitalized leases over a range of to years  depending upon the estimated life of the particular asset 
the company amortizes computer software over a range of to years  depending upon the estimated useful life of the software 
however  certain events could occur that would materially effect the company s estimates and assumptions related to depreciation 
unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management s assumptions regarding the company s ability to realize the return of its investment in operating assets and therefore affect the amount of depreciation expense to charge against both current and future revenues 
because depreciation expense is a function of analytical studies made of property  plant and equipment  subsequent studies could result in different estimates of useful lives and net salvage values 
if future depreciation studies yield results indicating that the company s assets have shorter lives as a result of obsolescence  physical condition  changes in technology or changes in net salvage values  the estimate of depreciation expense could increase 
likewise  if studies indicate that assets have longer lives  the estimate of depreciation expense could decrease 
for the year ended december   consolidated depreciation expense was million  representing of consolidated operating expenses 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were increased by one year  the consolidated depreciation expense would have decreased by approximately million or 
if the estimated lives of all assets being depreciated were decreased by one year  the consolidated depreciation expense would have increased by approximately million or 
provision for environmental remediation the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
the major environmental laws to which the company is subject  include  among others  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as the superfund law  the toxic substances control act  the federal water pollution control act  and the hazardous materials transportation act 
cercla can impose joint and several liability for cleanup and investigation costs  without regard to fault or legality of page the original conduct  on current and predecessor owners and operators of a site  as well as those who generate  or arrange for the disposal of  hazardous substances 
the risk of incurring environmental liability is inherent in the railroad industry 
the company owns property that is  or has been  used for industrial purposes 
use of these properties may subject the company to potentially material liabilities relating to the investigation and cleanup of contaminants  claims alleging personal injury  or property damage as the result of exposures to  or release of  hazardous substances 
the company conducts studies  as well as site surveys  to determine the extent of environmental damage and determine the necessary requirements to remediate this damage 
these studies incorporate the analysis of our internal environmental engineering staff and consultation with legal counsel 
from these studies and surveys  a range of estimates of the costs involved is derived and a liability and related expense for environmental remediation is recorded within this range 
the company s recorded liabilities for these issues represent its best estimates on an undiscounted basis of remediation and restoration costs that may be required to comply with present laws and regulations 
these estimates are based on forecasts of the total future direct costs related to environmental remediation 
these estimates change periodically as additional or better information becomes available as to the extent of site remediation required  if any 
in addition  advanced technologies related to the detection  appropriate remedial course of action and anticipated cost can influence these estimates 
certain changes could occur that would materially effect the company s estimates and assumptions related to costs for environmental remediation 
if the company becomes subject to more stringent environmental remediation costs at known sites  if the company discovers additional contamination  discovers previously unknown sites  or becomes subject to related personal or property damage  the company could incur material costs in connection with its environmental remediation 
accordingly  management believes that estimates related to the accrual of environmental remediation liabilities are critical to the company s results of operations 
for the year ended december   the expense related to environmental remediation was million and is included as purchased services expense on the consolidated statements of income 
additionally  as of december   the company has a total liability recorded for environmental remediation of million 
this amount was derived from a range of reasonable estimates based upon the company s studies and site surveys described above and in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for contingencies sfas 
for environmental remediation sites known as of december   if the highest estimate from the range based upon information presently available were recorded  the total estimated liability would have increased million in provision for casualty claims due to the nature of railroad operations  claims related to personal injuries  or third party liability resulting from crossing collisions as well as claims related to damage to personal property and other casualties  is a substantial expense to the company 
for personal injury claims  employees are compensated for work related injuries according to provisions contained within the federal employers liability act 
fela 
claims are estimated and recorded for known reported occurrences as well as for incurred but not reported ibnr occurrences 
consistent with the general practice within the railroad industry  the company s estimated liability for these casualty expenses is actuarially determined on an undiscounted basis 
in estimating the liability for casualty claims  the company obtains an estimate from an independent third party actuarial firm  which calculates an estimate using historical experiences and estimates of claim costs as well as numerous assumptions regarding factors relevant to the derivation of an estimate of future claim costs 
for other occupational injury claims  an assessment is made on a case by case basis in accordance with sfas personal injury and casualty claims are subject to a significant degree of uncertainty  especially estimates related to ibnr personal injuries as a party has yet to assert a claim and therefore the degree to which injuries have been incurred and the related costs have not yet been determined 
additionally  in estimating costs related to casualty claims  management must make assumptions regarding future costs 
the cost of casualty claims is significantly related to numerous factors  including the severity of the injury  the age of the claimant  and the legal jurisdiction 
therefore  in deriving an estimation of the provision for casualty claims  management must make assumptions related to substantially uncertain matters 
additionally  changes in the assumptions made in actuarial studies could potentially have a material effect on the estimate of the provision for casualty claims 
accordingly  management believes that the accounting estimate related to the liability for personal injuries and other casualty claims is critical to the company s results of operations 
page during the year ended december   the company modified its approach towards employee and third party personal injury liabilities 
prior to  the company s strategy had been to challenge claimants and prolong litigation  thereby potentially increasing the long term costs of the incident 
in  the company decided to aggressively pursue settlement options of open claims when warranted  thereby reducing legal costs and ultimately overall casualty expense 
this change in approach towards claim settlement led to substantial payments to claimants in for and prior year casualty incidents 
while this significantly impacted the company s casualty expense and related liability accounts  we believe this methodology has the company better positioned to control its ongoing casualty expense 
additionally  this change in approach towards claim settlement also led to changes in assumptions relating to the actuarial study conducted in order to estimate future claims cost and estimate an adequate reserve for casualty losses incurred 
for the year ended december   the provision for casualty events was approximately million and was included in casualties and insurance expense in the consolidated statements of income 
additionally  as of december   the company had a total liability recorded for casualty claims of approximately million 
for the year ended december   the provision for casualty expense represented of consolidated operating expenses 
for purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis  if the december  reserve were adjusted increased or decreased  casualty expense would have changed million 
provision for income taxes deferred income taxes represent a substantial liability of the company 
for financial reporting purposes  the company s management determines the company s current tax liability as well as those taxes incurred as a result of current operations yet deferred until future periods 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred 
currently payable income taxes represent the liability related to the company s income tax return for the current year while the net deferred tax expense or benefit represents the change in the balance of deferred tax assets or liabilities as reported on the balance sheet 
the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities for tax purposes as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when these differences reverse 
in addition to estimating the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences  management must also make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary 
if the differences are temporary  management must estimate the timing of their reversal  and whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets of the company 
accordingly  management believes that the estimate related to the provision for income taxes is critical to the company s results of operations 
for the years ended december    and  management made no material changes in its assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes 
however  certain events could occur that would materially affect the company s estimates and assumptions regarding deferred taxes 
changes in current tax laws and applicable enacted tax rates could affect the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  thereby impacting the company s income tax provision 
additionally  significant declines in taxable operating income could materially impact the realizable value of deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company s financial reporting basis exceeded the tax basis of its investment in grupo tfm by million 
management has not provided a deferred income tax liability for the income taxes  if any  that would become payable upon the realization of this basis difference as the company intends to reinvest in grupo tfm the financial statement earnings that yielded the basis difference 
likewise the company has no plans to realize this basis differential by a sale of its investment in grupo tfm 
if management were to change this assumption in determining its provision for deferred taxes  the impact on earnings could be significant 
if the company were to realize this basis difference in the future by a receipt of dividends or the sale of its investment in grupo tfm  as of december   the company could incur additional gross federal income taxes of approximately million  which may be partially or fully offset by mexican income taxes and could be available to reduce federal income taxes at such time 
for the year ended december   the company s provision for income taxes was million consisting of million for the current tax benefit and million for the deferred tax expense 
changes in management s estimates page and assumptions regarding the enacted tax rate applied to deferred tax assets and liabilities  the ability to realize the value of deferred tax assets  or the timing of the reversal of tax basis differences could potentially impact the provision for income taxes 
changes in these assumptions could potentially change the effective tax rate 
a change in the effective tax rate from exclusive of the equity in earnings of grupo tfm see results of operations income tax expense to would increase the current year income tax provision million 
equity in net earnings of grupo tfm equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is a significant component of the company s net income 
for financial reporting purposes  the company records equity in the net earnings of its unconsolidated affiliates in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
for the company s investment in grupo tfm  the equity in net earnings recorded by the company is materially impacted by estimates included in grupo tfm s tax computation 
these estimates are dependent to a certain extent on changes in mexican tax rates  fluctuations in the mexican rate of inflation and changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
to determine the income tax provision benefit and the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities  grupo tfm and kcs management must make assumptions and estimates related to material amounts into the future 
accordingly  management of the company believes that the accounting estimate made by grupo tfm and kcs management related to grupo tfm s provision for income taxes is a critical accounting estimate due to its significant impact on the company s results of operations 
for the years ended december  and  there were no material changes in the assumptions regarding the determination of the provision for income taxes for grupo tfm 
effective january   mexico implemented changes in its income tax laws that had an impact on the company s equity in grupo tfm s earnings reported under the equity method of accounting 
beginning in  the mexican corporate income tax rate will be reduced from to in one percent increments over the next four years 
as a result of this change in tax rates  management s assumptions and estimates related to the value of grupo tfm s net tax asset changed  and the value of grupo tfm s tax asset was reduced by approximately million in the year ended december  resulting in an impact of approximately million to the company 
the provision for income taxes and the value of grupo tfm s net deferred tax assets could further be impacted by changes in the rate of inflation in mexico  provisions within mexican tax law that provide for inflation indexation for tax purposes  as well as changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the mexican peso 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the company s equity in earnings in grupo tfm

southwestern electric power company swepco is the company s only customer that accounted for more than of revenues during the years ended december    and  respectively 
swepco is a subsidiary of american electric power  inc revenues related to swepco during these periods were   and million  respectively 
kcsr coal revenues declined in as a result of a contractual rate reduction for swepco  which became effective on january  derivative instruments and purchase commitments 
fuel expense is a significant component of the company s operating expenses 
fuel costs are affected by i traffic levels  ii efficiency of operations and equipment  and iii fuel market conditions 
controlling fuel expenses is a top priority of management 
as a result  from time to time  the company will enter into transactions to hedge against fluctuations in the price of its diesel fuel purchases to protect the company s operating results against adverse fluctuations in fuel prices 
kcsr enters into forward diesel fuel purchase commitments and commodity swap transactions fuel swaps or caps as a means of fixing future fuel prices
