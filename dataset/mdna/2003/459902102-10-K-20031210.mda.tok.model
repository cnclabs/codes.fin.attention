the results of anchor and the consolidation of the jv following the acquisition of anchor on december  were included for nine months in fiscal and the full year in fiscal prior to the anchor acquisition  our share of the jv was reflected net of expenses in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
shares and per share amounts for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the four for one stock split effective june  certain operations acquired with anchor were sold or held for sale  and therefore reclassified  including gain loss on sale  to discontinued operations for all periods presented 
fiscal included pretax reductions of million million after tax or per diluted share related to certain litigation settlements  and million million after tax or per diluted share for losses on early retirement of debt 
fiscal included pretax gains of million million after tax or per diluted share related to a legal settlement  and million million after tax or per diluted share on the sale of barcrest s japanese subsidiary 
fiscal income from operations included impairment and restructuring charges of million million after tax or per diluted share related to our operations in australia and brazil 
fiscal income from continuing operations included million million after tax or per diluted share for losses on early redemption of debt 
the increase in fiscal capital spending was primarily due to additional investments in gaming operations equipment and additional investments in plant equipment to improve the productivity of operations 
notes payable presented here is net of unamortized discount and interest rate swap fair value adjustments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole  and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results may differ from initial estimates 
igt s critical accounting policies that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain relate to our jackpot liabilities and expenses  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  bad debt expense and inventory 
these areas of our accounting estimates are the most sensitive to material change from external factors 
jackpot liabilities and expenses igt recognizes a liability for jackpots not yet won and jackpot expense for the cost to fund these jackpots in the future 
jackpots are generally payable in equal installments over a to year period or immediately in the case of our instant win progressive jackpots 
winners may elect to receive a single payment for the present value of a jackpot discounted at applicable interest rates in lieu of annual installments 
interest rates eligible for use in the single payment calculation vary by jurisdiction and are impacted by market forces and other economic conditions 
the most recent history pattern indicates that approximately of winners will elect the single payment option 
we fund jackpot installment payments through qualifying us government or agency securities 
to calculate the present value of our outstanding progressive jackpot liabilities  we use current market prime  treasury  and agency rates weighted based on the historical single payment election ratio 
we believe this calculation provides the best estimate of our cost to fund jackpots 
additionally  we estimate our current liabilities for jackpots not yet won based on our historical experience with winners payment elections  in conjunction with the theoretical projected number of jackpots expected to hit within one year 
changes in future winners payment elections could impact the allocation of our jackpot liabilities between current and non current liabilities 
our jackpot expense totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million in fiscal although the majority of material changes to jackpot expense relate to market interest rate trends see item a  market risk and the volume of slot play  changes in our estimates and assumptions regarding the number of jackpot winners who may elect single payments in the future could impact our gaming operations jackpot expense and gross profit 
because current year single payment funding rates have been essentially the same as installment funding rates during fiscal  if we changed our estimate of winners expected to elect the single payment option by  our jackpot expense for fiscal year would not have change materially 
intangible assets and goodwill we assign estimated useful lives to our intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory and contractual provisions  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors 
we are required to use judgment and make estimates to determine the useful lives of intangible assets 
we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives to reflect the pattern in which the economic benefits for the assets will be consumed based on projected revenues 
intangible assets with an increasing revenue stream are amortized using the straight line method 
intangible assets with a declining revenue stream are amortized on an accelerated basis 
we evaluate the carrying value of our intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually in august or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
indicators that could trigger an impairment review include changes in legal  regulatory  or economic factors  market conditions or operational performance 
impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the intangible assets and is recognized as a component of income from operations 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on amortization expense 
amortization expense totaled million for fiscal and million for fiscal we estimated that a decrease in the estimated remaining useful lives would have increased amortization expense by million for fiscal and million for fiscal income taxes for financial reporting  we use estimates and judgments to determine our current tax liability  as well as those taxes deferred until future periods 
net deferred and accrued income taxes represent significant assets and liabilities to igt 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes  we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
adjustments to deferred taxes are determined based upon the changes in differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by future tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
this process also involves estimating our current tax position in each jurisdiction  as well as making judgments as to whether our taxable income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recover any deferred tax assets 
we establish a valuation allowance to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the us and other jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of liabilities could result in tax benefits being recognized in the current period 
if our estimated tax liabilities were understated  a charge to our tax provision would result 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates  geographic mix or the estimated level of annual taxable income could change the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and affect the overall effective tax rate and impact the tax provision 
accordingly  we believe that the estimate related to our provision for income taxes is critical to our financial results 
bad debt expense we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts related to our accounts  contracts  and notes receivable that we have deemed to have a high risk of collectibility 
we analyze historical collection trends  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
while our estimates for these matters are reliable and calculated with due care  if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our bad debt expense could change  which would impact our income from operations 
inventory we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record charges for excess and obsolete inventory  based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
the determination of obsolete or excess inventory requires us to estimate the future demand for our products within specific time horizons  generally  one year or less 
if our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we may need to record additional charges for inventory obsolescence  which would have a negative impact on our gross profit 
we could be required to increase our inventory charges and our gross margins could be adversely affected if there were to be an unexpected and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there were a higher occurrence of inventory obsolescence because of changes in technology or customer requirements 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times versus the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements

our operating income margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily due to the consolidation of jv gross revenues for nine months in fiscal in the first quarter of fiscal and the full fiscal year  the jv revenues were recorded net of expenses in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
fiscal as presented above reflected the reclassification of extraordinary items to other expense in income from continuing operations in accordance with the adoption of sfas at the beginning of fiscal see note of our consolidated financial statements 
excluding the effect of charges related to certain litigation settlements and losses on early debt retirement noted above  income from continuing operations improved and earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased in fiscal compared to fiscal foreign operations approximately of our total revenues and earnings of unconsolidated affiliates in fiscal were derived outside of north america  compared to in fiscal  and in fiscal our foreign operations have declined in their proportionate share of consolidated revenues primarily due to increased domestic revenues related to the anchor acquisition and increased replacement demand

the inclusion of anchor s operations for twelve months in fiscal and nine months in fiscal contributed to increases in all operating expense categories except bad debts 
fiscal operating expenses also increased as the result of o higher employee benefit costs including group insurance and performance based incentives o increased salaries and wages  predominantly in sales and product development o legal costs related to protection of our intellectual property rights o severance costs of million associated with the closing of a former anchor facility in bozeman  montana and staffing reductions in australia o our ongoing investment in r d fiscal bad debt expense was reduced by the partial recovery of receivables previously reserved for in fiscal related to economic instability and currency devaluation in argentina in december we have restructured all of our significant argentine receivables affected by the devaluation 
fiscal operating expenses increased over as the result of o legal costs related to protection of intellectual property rights o amortization of anchor s finite lived intangibles acquired totaling million o additional costs to update our internal systems with an erp solution o our ongoing investment in r d at the beginning of fiscal  we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  reducing annual amortization by approximately million related to previously acquired goodwill

increased interest expense in fiscal related to the issuance of zero coupon convertible debentures in january was offset by decreased interest expense resulting from senior note repurchases in fiscal of million principal amount 
the fluctuation in other expense  net  for fiscal resulted from o legal settlement charges of million primarily related to a dispute with a former gaming machine distributor o losses on early debt retirement totaling million  mainly due to our repurchase of anchor s senior notes in july operation of our wap systems games resulted in interest income accretion from annuity investments purchased to fund installment jackpot payments and interest expense accrued on related jackpot liabilities at the same rate earned on the investments 
therefore  interest income and expense related to funding installment based jackpot payments are similar and increase at approximately the same rate based on the growth in total jackpot winners electing installment payments 
interest income and expense related to wap systems annuities totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the fluctuation in our effective income tax rate was based primarily on changes to the geographic mix of estimated annual taxable income 
we estimate our income tax rate will be approximately for fiscal business segment results igt s segment profit reflects income from continuing operations before tax  including an applicable allocation of operating expenses  as well as other income and expense

gross margin units shipped    fiscal domestic unit shipments increased due to strong growth in replacement sales  which increased to  machines 
shipments of machines to new or expanding properties were also up to  units in fiscal compared to these volume improvements related to o continued demand for our ez pay tm tito technology across all major domestic markets o popularity of igt games  including spinning reel  video poker and video simulated spinning reel games o strong replacement sales in the government operated public gaming markets  namely the canadian provinces of quebec and saskatchewan o greater sales of new and expansion machines into a majority of casino markets  most significantly in california  new york  arizona  nevada and new jersey we expect igt s innovations in slot technology  such as multi denomination and ez pay tito  as well as our leadership in game design and the broad based acceptance of cashless technologies  to continue to stimulate replacement demand for our gaming machines 
several major casino resorts have committed to multi year replacement programs to exchange existing slot machines for our ez pay systems and tito equipped machines throughout their properties nationwide 
we anticipate increases in us replacement machine sales in fiscal will offset expected reductions in unit sales into the canadian public gaming markets 
additionally  fiscal domestic average sales prices improved over the prior year related to o increased non machine revenues related to gaming systems installations and related parts  game conversion and content fees o increased ez pay tm related royalty and license fees o the realization of price increases fiscal domestic replacement units increased 
overall domestic shipments declined slightly from fiscal as the result of fewer shipments to new or expanded properties in nevada and california  partially offset by increases across all other north american jurisdictions

net cash flows to fund jackpot liabilities in millions investments to fund liabilities to jackpot winners purchases proceeds investing activities jackpot liabilities collection to fund jackpot liabilities payments to winners financing activities net cash flows from jackpot systems investments to fund jackpot liabilities relates only to installment based payments to winners 
purchases of these investments occur for the present value of a jackpot when the player wins and elects installment based payments 
proceeds occur as the investments mature  in equal annual installments over a to year period 
jackpot liabilities relate to all wap jackpot systems  irrespective of which payment method the winner elects 
payments to winners include both installment based payments and single payments 
see the jackpot liabilities and expenses section of our critical accounting policies discussed above and footnote of our consolidated financial statements 
net cash flows from these activities represent timing differences between the growth in liabilities for progressive jackpots and the actual payments to the winners during the period 
fluctuations in net cash flows to fund jackpot liabilities occur based on the timing of the jackpot cycles and the volume of play across all of our wap systems games 
the increased cash flow volumes related to jackpot investments and liabilities in fiscal and are due primarily to the consolidation of the jv jackpot systems in conjunction with the anchor acquisition for the full year in fiscal and nine months in fiscal additionally  the comparative prior years were adjusted to match the fiscal presentation to exclude non cash interest accretion from investments and collections

senior notes in fiscal  we issued billion of senior notes in two tranches  million at due may  and million at due may   in a private placement subsequently exchanged for registered notes

our current domestic line of credit agreement for million expires in august and our foreign lines expire at various times through july anchor s long term debt igt assumed approximately million  net of discount  of anchor s long term debt upon the completion of the acquisition 
immediately following the acquisition  we fully repaid and terminated anchor s senior credit facility of million using available cash 
in fiscal  we repurchased substantially all of anchor s remaining outstanding senior subordinated notes due  primarily in a cash tender offer  recognizing a loss of million 
debt covenants our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on future performance  which is subject to general economic conditions and to financial  business  regulatory and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we are required to comply with certain covenants contained in these agreements  including restrictions on our ability to o incur indebtedness o grant liens on our assets o enter into sale leaseback transactions o make investments  acquisitions  or divestitures o pay dividends o make certain other restricted payments without the written consent of the lenders if we are unable to maintain the financial ratios required under our bank revolving line of credit  the lenders could terminate their commitments and declare all amounts borrowed  together with accrued interest and fees  to be immediately due and payable 
if this happened  other indebtedness that contains cross default or cross acceleration provisions  including the senior notes  may also be accelerated to become due and payable immediately 
if any of these events should occur  we may not be able to pay such amounts 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants at september  financial condition september  increase in millions total assets   total liabilities   total stockholders equity   total assets increased million during fiscal primarily due to increased cash related to the issuance of the debentures  operating cash flows  and proceeds from sales of discontinued operations 
total liabilities increased million during fiscal primarily from the issuance of the debentures 
total stockholders equity increased million primarily as the result of net income generated during the current period  offset by treasury stock repurchases and dividend distributions 
additional paid in capital also increased as the result of employee stock plans 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk such as performance bonds and other guarantees  which are not reflected in our balance sheet 
we do not expect any material losses to result from these off balance sheet arrangements and we are not dependent on off balance sheet financing arrangements to fund our operations 
see note of our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use derivative financial instruments to minimize our market risk exposure resulting from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
the primary business objective of our hedging program  as defined in our corporate risk management policy  is to minimize the impact of transaction  remeasurement  and specified economic exposures to our net income and earnings per share 
the counter parties to these instruments are major commercial banks and we believe that losses related to credit risk are remote 
we are not party to leveraged derivatives and do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we routinely use forward exchange contracts to hedge our net exposures  by currency  related to the nonfunctional currency monetary assets and liabilities of our operations 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
at september   our net foreign currency exposure totaled million related to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional foreign currency 
these exposures were hedged with million in forward currency contracts 
at september   we had net foreign currency exposure of million related to our monetary assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional foreign currency and million for a firm sales commitment denominated in canadian dollars 
these exposures were hedged with million in forward contracts 
the hedge for the firm commitment was designated a fair value hedge under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and there was no hedge ineffectiveness 
given our foreign exchange position  a adverse change in foreign exchange rates upon which these foreign exchange contracts are based would result in exchange gains and losses 
in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange gains and losses on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from unhedged foreign currency exposures 
as currency rates change  translation of our foreign currency functional businesses into us dollars affects year over year comparability of equity 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from our international operations are generally reinvested locally 
changes in the currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating our international net assets included the australian dollar  the british pound  the japanese yen and the euro 
we estimated that a change in foreign exchange rates would have impacted reported equity by approximately million at september  versus million at september  this sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one area may or may not be offset by losses from another area 
interest rate risk fluctuations in prime  treasury and agency rates due to changes in market and other economic conditions directly impact our costs to fund jackpots  and therefore our gross profit in proprietary gaming 
if interest rates decline  our costs increase  and correspondingly our gross profit declines 
we estimated that a decline in interest rates would have reduced our gross profit by million in fiscal and million in fiscal we do not currently manage this exposure with derivative financial instruments 
our outstanding senior notes carry interest at fixed rates 
if interest rates increased by  we estimated the fair market value of these notes would have decreased approximately million at september  and million at september  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into four interest rate swap agreements with a combined notional amount of million  primarily to strategically diversify a portion of our debt portfolio between fixed and variable rate instruments 
under the terms of the interest rate swaps  we will make payments based on a specific spread over six month libor  and receive payments equal to the interest rate on our fixed rate senior notes due in based on rates prevailing at september   these swaps reduced our effective interest rate from to approximately on the senior notes due in convertible debentures price risk the fair value of our debentures is sensitive to changes in both our stock price and interest rates 
assuming interest rates are held constant  we estimated a decrease in our stock price would decrease the fair value of our convertible debentures by million 
assuming our stock price is held constant  we estimated a increase in interest rates would decrease the fair value of our convertible debentures by million
