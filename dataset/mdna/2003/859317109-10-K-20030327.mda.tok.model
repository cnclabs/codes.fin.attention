item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides management s analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of sterling financial corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of lancaster county  na  first national bank of north east  bank of hanover and trust company  hovb investment co  t c leasing  inc t c  pennbanks insurance company  spc and sterling mortgage services  inc inactive 
the consolidated financial statements also include town country leasing  llc  sterling financial trust company and equipment finance  inc  all wholly owned subsidiaries of bank of lancaster county 
management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report and is intended to assist in understanding and evaluating the major changes in the financial condition and results of operations of the company with a primary focus in sterling s performance 
critical accounting policies sterling s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and follow general practices within the industries in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the most significant accounting policies followed by sterling are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the evaluation of goodwill impairment to be the accounting areas that requires the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   sterling is no longer required to amortize goodwill resulting from business acquisitions 
goodwill is now subject to impairment testing at least annually to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
sterling tests for impairment based on the goodwill maintained at each defined reporting unit 
a fair value is determined by an independent party using various market valuation methodologies 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write downs of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less  an expense may be required on sterling s books to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
sterling completed its annual impairment testing and determined that no impairment write offs were necessary 
no assurance can be given that future impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
any material effect on the financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed in this management discussion and analysis 
inflation and interest rates the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets and on noninterest expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
inflationary pressures over the last few years have been modest  although the potential for future inflationary pressure is always present given changing trends in the economy 
fluctuations in interest rates impact financial institutions far more than inflationary factors 
during  the federal reserve lowered interest rates only once in november  which totaled basis points bp the stability in interest rates throughout was in sharp contrast to the previous two years 
during  the federal reserve aggressively reduced interest rates during the year in order to mitigate the effects of a slumping national economy 
interest rates were cut eleven times during  resulting in a reduction of the prime lending rate by bp in  interest rates were increased four times  for a total of bp management recognizes that asset liability management  including the effect of rate changes on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is of critical importance

earning assets include loans  securities and federal funds sold 
interest bearing funds include deposits and borrowed funds 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
due to demand deposits and stockholders equity  the net interest margin exceeds the interest rate spread  as these funding sources are non interest bearing 
table presents net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis  interest rate spread and net interest margin for the years ending december   and table analyzes the changes in net interest income for the periods broken down by their rate and volume components 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  totaled  for excluding the interest recovery on a charged off loan  compared to  in and  in the increase in net interest income of  from to reflects both a increase in the average balance of interest earning assets as well as a basis point bp increase in net interest margin 
sterling s newest subsidiary  equipment financing inc  added  of this increase 
the increase in interest earning assets came primarily in the form of loans 
strong growth in the commercial loan portfolio  in part due to the acquisition of efi  contributed to this increase 
funding this growth in assets were increases in both deposits and borrowings  maintaining a relatively consistent mix of funding sources 
in march  sterling participated in a trust preferred issuance  raising million 
in addition  during the third quarter of  the corporation leveraged the proceeds of the trust preferred by borrowing  from the federal home loan bank and initiated the purchase of securities with these funds 
the increase in net interest margin from to marked a reversal in a declining trend over the previous three years 
the improving mix of earning assets in the balance sheet to higher yielding assets  including the equipment finance  inc receivables acquired  and the positive impact of generally declining interest rates led to the increase in net interest margin 
during the two years from january to december of  the federal reserve bank lowered the federal funds rate twelve times totaling 
this dramatic decrease in short term interest rates has resulted in a significant decrease in the cost of funds for sterling 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined bp from to resulting from the reduction of rates paid on deposit accounts  the maturing of higher rate deposits and borrowings  deposit growth at low rates of interest  less reliance on third party borrowings to fund growth in both finance and operating leases  which impacts the margin in two ways third party borrowings tend to be more costly than average rates paid on deposits  and the interest expense associated with funding attributed to the operating lease portfolio increases interest expense but the revenues earned on the operating leases are reported as rental income and thus not interest income 
the rate earned on interest earning assets declined only bp reflecting a lag in the effect of rapidly declining rates on loan and securities portfolio yields due to the proportion of fixed rates of interest in the portfolios  growth in the loan portfolio  shifting the mix of earning assets 
this growth also included the relatively higher margin on finance receivables from the newly acquired equipment financing inc subsidiary  and immediate decrease in rates of interest earned on federal funds sold  other short term investments and variable rate loans and securities

the increase in net interest income of  from to was principally due to increases in average interest earning assets  offset somewhat by a declining net interest rate spread 
average earning assets grew while net interest margin declined bp several factors had an impact on s net interest margin rapidly falling interest rate environment during the year caused the downward repricing of interest earning assets more rapidly than interest bearing liabilities  less profitable interest earning mix  in which federal funds sold carried significantly higher balances as the corporation tried to increase liquidity to fund loan growth  and increased reliance on third party borrowings to fund both finance and operating leases

income from fiduciary activities  which includes both institutional trust and personal wealth management services  grew to  for the year ended december   up from  or in and  in at december   sterling had total assets under administration of approximately million compared to million at the end of and million at the end of these numbers include assets under management of million  million  and million at december   and the positive effects of new business development  which increased the number of trust customers and related fees  offset the decline in fees resulting from market declines that occurred in the past two years  and that had a negative impact on fee based income 
management believes that wealth management business represents a continued growth opportunity for the corporation 
through the formation of a separate trust company  sterling financial trust company  sterling believes it will be able to increase revenue generation opportunities  while increasing operating efficiencies 
other service charges  commissions and fees were  in  a increase over s total of  in the latter part of  sterling entered into an agreement to partner with an independent securities broker dealer to grow mutual fund and annuity fee based commissions 
as a result of a more concentrated sales effort  combined with a more competitive commission fee structure  mutual fund and annuity commissions have increased approximately  over in addition  other service charges and fees have increased due to continued growth in customer debit card usage and higher volumes of customers enrolled in cash management programs 
the increase in income noted during and resulted from increased customer debit card usage and higher volumes of customers enrolled in cash management programs 
mortgage banking income was  in  compared to  in and  in mortgage banking income has been favorably influenced by the trend noted in the financial services industry  which has seen an increased volume of mortgage loan originations refinancing during the past two years  as interest rates have dropped significantly to year lows 
as a result of the rate environment  mortgage banking income increased throughout  despite accelerated amortization of mortgage servicing rights  and related impairment charges that have resulted from faster prepayment speeds 
rental income on operating leases has increased from  in to  in this follows an increase of in over results 
the increase in rental income is primarily due to an increase in the number of units under operating leases  which were   and  as of december    and sterling recognizes that leasing operations represent a growth opportunity and has committed resources to expand this line of business 
other operating income was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or  over s operating income of  the increase in other income is primarily the result of the continued growth in insurance related revenues which increased  over  as well as increased handling charges on the lease portfolio 
the increase is primarily attributable to the increased revenues generated from sterling s reinsurance credit life and disability activities that began in securities gains and losses  all from the available for sale portfolio  are summarized as follows net realized gains losses debt securities gains losses equity securities gains  losses  gains and losses on debt securities are realized as part of ongoing investment portfolio and balance sheet management strategies

net securities losses on equities were  for the year ended december  versus securities gains of  in and  in gains are taken as the result of ongoing asset liability management strategies  and capitalizing on appreciated values on certain equity security portfolio positions

no similar charges were taken in normal merit increases to existing employees  coupled with replacing positions at higher wages than previously earned  increased number of employees  the result of branch expansion during the year and to support increased transaction volumes associated with a growing organization  incremental salaries and benefits associated with the equipment finance  inc acquisition  increased health and welfare benefits costs  consistent with national trends  and higher incentive accruals resulting from the corporation s performance levels during exceeding that achieved in the  increase in salary and employee benefits in over was the result of normal merit increases  additional staffing needs for branch expansion  increases in employee benefit costs  and redundancies in a limited number of positions  as operations relocated from hanover and northeast to lancaster 
net occupancy expense was  in   in and  in the increase experienced in was primarily the result of a larger branch network  expansion and renovations made at certain existing office locations to better serve our customer s needs 
similarily  the increase in over was primarily the result of several branches that opened throughout  which were fully operational for the entire year 
the  or  increase in furniture and equipment expense during versus was the result of an increase in number of office locations  as well as higher depreciation and service contract charges that resulted from the enhanced operating system that sterling converted to in similarly  the  or increase in furniture and equipment expense during versus was the result of the increased number of office locations  as well as the increased maintenance costs associated with more sophisticated methods to deliver our services to our customer base 
professional service expense was  for the year ended december   an increase over results 
this followed a increase in professional service expense in as compared to approximately  of the increase can be attributed to professional fees related to the conversion of a non bank affiliate from a c corporation to a limited liability corporation 
the remainder of the increase in can be attributed to long term strategic planning efforts  combined with increased professional services for implementation of corporate governance issues that have resulted from the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in professional service expense in over can be attributed to sterling s increased reliance on services outsourced to third parties who can bring a greater degree of knowledge to the organization  temporary contracted professional resources to assist in the core processing conversions that took place in  and legal and other consulting fees associated with the formation of two new business ventures 
depreciation on operating lease assets were  in   in  and  in the increase is consistent with the growth noted in rental income on operating leases 
depreciation expense on leased property increased to of rental income on operating leases compared to for and during the third quarter of  sterling completed its merger with hanover bancorp  inc and incurred  of merger related and restructuring charges 
the direct costs that resulted from the merger were  and consisted principally of legal  accounting  investment advising fees  as well as regulatory filing fees and other miscellaneous expenses 
in addition  sterling incurred restructuring costs of  which primarily consists of severance and related benefits  professional fees  termination fees related to non cancelable service contracts and asset write offs related to conversion of the banking subsidiaries into a common core processing system 
the conversion to the new core processing system and resulting reduction in the workforce resulted in net annual savings of approximately million  of which approximately one third was realized in and the full amount was realized in the following summarizes the restructuring expenses charged to operations during  and the remaining restructuring accrual balance at december  the remainder of the accrual will be paid out in the first quarter of initial remaining expense accrual employee termination asset disposal write downs noncancelable contracts professional fees other other noninterest expense totaled  during versus  in and  in significant expense components in this category include marketing and advertising  postage  lending related activities  investor shareholder relations  taxes other than income  and insurance related activities 
the increase in expense noted during and was the direct result of sterling s overall growth  which results in increases in these types of expenses as well 
operating expenses levels are often measured by the efficiency ratio  which expresses noninterest expense  excluding merger related and restructuring charges  as a percentage of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
in calculating its efficiency ratio  sterling nets depreciation on operating leases with the related rental income to more consistently present operating results with the banking industry 
sterling s efficiency ratio  excluding unusual items such as securities activities  restructuring charges  severance and other infrequent items  was   and for the years ended december   and the improvement noted in sterling s efficiency ratio is primarily driven by the increase in net interest income  combined with a centralized operations function  which allowed for the elimination of redundant costs associated with running the three bank affiliates on different operating systems 
the centralized operations function allows for better utilization of fixed costs  such as premises and equipment  and variable costs  which includes employee resources 
in  sterling s efficiency ratio slipped  the result of margin compression  combined with redundant data processing costs as the bank affiliates were converting to a new computer system 
income taxes sterling recognized income taxes of   and  for the years ended december   and the effective tax rate  which measures income tax expense as a percent of pre tax income  totaled  and for the years ended december    and sterling s effective tax rate is less than the federal statutory rate  primarily due to tax exempt loan and security income  tax credits associated with low income housing projects  offset by certain non deductible expenses and state income taxes 
although sterling s effective tax rate did not deviate much from  the composition of the expense has changed 
during  sterling reversed a  deferred state tax liability that resulted when a non bank sterling affiliate converted from a c corporation to a limited liability corporation 
offsetting the state tax benefit realized on the limited liability conversion was higher state income tax expense contributed by sterling s commercial finance segment 
the effective tax rate was somewhat higher than and as result of non deductible merger expenses 
financial condition average earning assets increased in to  from  in and  in solid growth in the commercial loans portfolio and the addition of  in finance receivables associated with the acquisition of equipment finance  inc contributed greatly to the increase in average earning assets 
additionally  sterling s security portfolio increased over the last three years  as a result of its funding exceeding the loan demand 
offsetting the increases was a  decline in average residential mortgages 
average funding sources  or interest bearing liabilities  increased in to  from  in and  in investment securities sterling utilizes investment securities to generate interest and dividend income  assist in managing interest rate risk  and to provide liquidity to the parent company and affiliates 
strong deposit growth and additional third party borrowings used to capitalize on the low interest rate environment outpaced loan and lease growth during  resulting in the excess funds being invested in the securities portfolio 
much of the securities growth was in tax free municipal portfolio  which provided competitive tax adjusted yields during  and as a result of the sluggish national economy  sterling elected to shift a portion of its securities portfolio from corporate securities  to safer and lower risk weighted agency securities  during at december   the securities balance included net unrealized gains on available for sale securities of  versus net unrealized gains of  at december  the reduction in interest rates led to the increased appreciation in the fair value of securities during  combined with a steepening interest yield curve during compared to table investment securities the following table shows the amortized cost of the held to maturity securities owned by sterling as of the dates indicated

loans loans outstanding increased  or in  compared to growth experienced in the growth in loans is consistent with a stable local economy  and continued demand for loans to support existing customers growth 
the commercial loan portfolio experienced strong growth during the period  increased by  or 
this growth trend is consistent with the trend noted in prior years  and is the result of actively marketing commercial services to professionals in the target market  leading to an increased referral base 
also contributing to loan growth was the addition of  in finance receivables acquired through equipment finance  inc offsetting the commercial loan and finance receivables growth  was a  decrease in real estate mortgage loans 
this is consistent with the trend of increasing our emphasis on commercial loan products  combined with holding fewer mortgage loans for portfolio  given the low interest rate environment 
as mentioned previously  declining interest rates in resulted in a great deal of refinancings of portfolio loans 
given the low interest rates on newly originated loans  management has sold a higher percentage of mortgage loans in the secondary market than in the past in order to manage its interest rate risk position  and reduce its position of low yielding  long duration mortgage loans

asset quality sterling s loan portfolios are subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk is mitigated through prudent underwriting standards  on going credit review  and monitoring and reporting asset quality measures 
additionally  loan portfolio diversification  limiting exposure to a single industry or borrower  and requiring collateral also reduces sterling s credit risk 
sterling s commercial  consumer and residential mortgage loans are principally to borrowers in south central pennsylvania and northern maryland 
as the majority of sterling s loans are located in this area  a substantial portion of the debtor s ability to honor their obligations may be affected by the level of economic activity in the market area 
sterling s finance receivables are primarily to customers in the eastern part of the united states to finance forestry and land clearing equipment 
the unemployment rate in sterling s market area remained below the national average during additionally  reasonably low interest rates  a stable local economy and minimal inflation continued to support favorable economic conditions in the area 
non performing assets include nonaccrual and restructured loans  accruing loans past due days or more and other foreclosed assets 
sterling s general policy has been to cease accruing interest on loans when management determines that a reasonable doubt exists as to the collectibility of additional interest 
when management places a loan on nonaccrual status  it reverses unpaid interest credited to income in the current year  and charges unpaid interest accrued in prior years to the allowance for loan losses 
sterling recognizes income on these loans only to the extent that it receives cash payments 
sterling typically returns nonaccrual loans to performing status when the borrower brings the loan current and performs in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time 
sterling categorizes a loan as restructured if it changes the terms of the loan such as interest rate  repayment schedule or both  to terms that it otherwise would not have granted originally 
table nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans december  nonaccrual loans     accruing loans  past due days or more    restructured loans    total non performing loans      foreclosed assets total non performing assets      nonaccrual loans interest income that would have been recorded under original terms interest income recorded ratios non performing loans to total loans non performing assets to total loans and foreclosed assets non performing assets to total assets as of december   non performing assets were  an increase of  or from december  the increase in nonaccrual loans is primarily the result of three large credits that moved into nonaccrual status during the second half of one of these loans is fully secured by real estate  while the other loans are partially secured by the business assets and personal guarantees 
although the percentage increase in non performing loans exceeds the increase in total loans  which results in an increase in non performing loans to loans outstanding  sterling s ratio is still consistent with peer group 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans that have characteristics that cause management to have serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to perform under present loan repayment terms and that may result in the reporting of these loans as nonperforming loans in the future 
total potential problem loans approximated million at december  additionally  outstanding letter of credit commitments totaling approximately million could result in potential problem loans  if drawn upon 
the majority of these loans are secured by real estate with acceptable loan to value ratios 
allowance for loan losses sterling maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings 
additionally  when sterling acquires a company in a purchase business combination  the acquired allowance is combined with sterling s existing allowance 
quarterly  the company utilizes a defined methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
this methodology considers specific credit reviews  past loan loss historical experience  and qualitative factors 
the application of this methodology was recently enhanced and results in an allowance consisting of two components  allocated and unallocated 
management assigns internal risk ratings to all commercial relationships with aggregate borrowings or commitments to extend credit in excess of  using migration analysis for the previous eight quarters  management develops a loss factor test  which it then uses to estimate losses on impaired loans  potential problem loans and non classified loans 
when management finds loans with uncertain collectibility of principal and interest  it places those loans on the problem list  and evaluates them on a quarterly basis in order to estimate potential losses 
management s analysis considers adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of underlying collateral  and prevailing market conditions 
if management determines that a specific reserve allocation is not required  it assigns the general loss factor based on historical performance to determine the reserve 
for homogeneous loan types  such as consumer and residential mortgage loans  management bases specific allocations on the average loss ratio for the previous two years for each specific loan pool 
additionally  management adjusts projected loss ratios for other factors  including the following trends in delinquency levels  trends in non performing and potential problem loans  trends in composition  volume and terms of loans  effects in changes in lending policies or underwriting procedures  experience ability and depth of management  national and local economic conditions  concentrations in lending activities  and other factors as management may deems appropriate 
management determines the unallocated portion of the allowance for loan losses based on the following criteria risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at that time 
management believes this methodology accurately reflects losses inherent in the portfolio 
management charges actual loan losses to the allowance for loan losses 
management periodically updates this methodology  which reduces the difference between actual losses and estimated losses 
management recently enhanced the application of the methodology to more appropriately reflect the risk associated with the factors indicated above 
management bases the provision for loan losses on the overall analysis taking the methodology into account 
a summary of the activity in the allowance for loan losses is as follows table summary of loan loss experience years ended december  beginning balance      allowance acquired in acquisition loans charged off during year commercial  financial and agricultural  real estate mortgage consumer  lease financing finance receivables total charge offs      recoveries commercial  financial and agricultural real estate mortgage consumer lease financing finance receivables total recoveries  net loans charged off    provision for loan losses     balance at end of year      ratio of net loans charged off to average loans outstanding ending allowance for loan losses to net loans charged off x x x x x net loans charged off to provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans outstanding allowance for loan losses as a percent of non performing loans the allowance for loan losses increased  from  at december   to  at december  the allowance represents of loans outstanding at december   versus as of the prior year end 
net charge offs were  for the year ended december   versus  in  a decrease of 
a primary reason for the decrease in charge offs was a recovery of approximately  in insurance proceeds 
this recovery represents a large portion of the loans charged off in  that resulted from loans made to a customer under fraudulent representations from them 
excluding the affect of this chargeoff and subsequent recovery  commercial loan net charge offs increased  in v 
additionally  both consumer and residential mortgage loan charge offs increased  primarily the result of increasing unemployment and bankruptcies 
despite the slight improvement in overall charge offs  sterling increased its provision for loan losses to  in order to maintain the adequacy of the reserve  due primarily to increased non performing assets and higher levels of outstanding loans and leases 
also  as a result of the equipment finance  inc acquisition  sterling added  to its allowance for loan losses

additionally  management enhanced the application of the allowance methodology in  which served to more appropriately reflect the risk associated with the factors and resulted in a more refined allocation methodology 
consequently  a portion of the unallocated reserve was reclassified to the allocated reserve  without an increase in probable loan losses 
the largest reserve allocation is to the commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio  which represents approximately of the reserve balance 
this reflects the increase in non performing loans and non performing assets  increases in loans  and changes in other factors that impact the inherent risks in the portfolio 
this non homogeneous loan portfolio  along with leases  continues to represent the greatest risk exposure to sterling 
the loans  generally  are larger than the remainder of the portfolio and the related collateral is not as marketable 
additionally  other external factors  such as competition for high rated credits  is also considered in allocating this reserve balance 
during  sterling sold its credit card portfolio  which was included in the consumer loan category in determining the allocation of the allowance for loan losses 
as a result of the sale of this portfolio  sterling had seen an improvement in charge offs in consumer loans in through  which resulted in lower historical charge off percentages used in developing the quantitative portion of the reserve allocation 
as a result  the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to the consumer loan portfolio generally lowered from as a result of the recent downturn in the economy and management s approach in more aggressively charging off consumer loans  sterling has experienced a steady increase in net charge offs during the last two years 
this increase which led to higher historical charge off percentages  combined with an increased qualitative adjustment  resulted in an increase in the consumer loan allocation in during  the reserve allocation related to the lease portfolio has increased consistent with the trends noted in lease charge offs during the last two years and continued uncertainty as to the impact of the economy on the slumping transportation industry and other factors that impact the inherent risks in the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance reflects estimated inherent losses within the portfolio that have not been detected 
the unallocated portion of the reserve is due to risk of error in the specific and general reserve allocations  other potential exposure in the loan portfolio  variances in management s assessment of national and local economic conditions  and other internal or external factors that management believes appropriate at the time 
while management believes sterling s allowance for loan losses is adequate based on information currently available  future adjustments to the reserve may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions  and management s assumptions as to future delinquencies or loss rates 
assets held for operating leases assets held for operating leases  net of accumulated depreciation  were  at december   an increase of  from the december   balance of  assets held for operating leases were  at december  the increase is a result of an increase in the number of units under operating leases  which were   and  as of december    and operating leases have residual value risk associated with them 
operating lease terms  including monthly rental payment and length of the lease  are established based upon the residual value  or the estimate of fair value of the leased asset at the end of the lease term 
if  at the end of the lease term  the fair value of the leased property is less than the residual value calculated at lease origination  a loss on disposal could result 
sterling mitigates this risk through use of anticipated values published by various industries  and in some instances  discussions with industry experts 
further  the lease terms include provisions that the lessee shares the risk of loss on disposal of equipment  up to of the residual value 
deposits sterling continues to rely heavily on deposit growth as the primary source of funds for lending activities 
average deposits increased  or million  in this increase is consistent with the growth trend noted in this growth has been achieved through the development of products that meet the needs of our customers 
in addition  deposits have grown as these consumers  who have lost confidence in the stock market  migrate to deposit products  which they generally regard as safer  more liquid investments 
sterling will continue to explore new products to meet the needs of customers  particularly in this low interest rate environment

as of december   short term borrowings were  an increase of  from the december  balance of  this increase is primarily attributable to sterling borrowing  under a line of credit to fund finance receivables  offset by a decrease of approximately  of short term floating debt that was converted to fixed long term debt 
long term debt consists primarily of advances from the federal home loan bank and borrowings from other financial institutions to fund sterling s growth in its finance and operating lease portfolios 
long term debt was  at december   an increase of  from december  a majority of the long term debt primarily occurred in the first half of  and consisted primarily of three items 
first   was the result of the corporation s desire to lock in low interest rates and provide liquidity to its affiliates 
second  during the second quarter  the corporation leveraged the proceeds of the trust preferred by borrowing an additional  finally  sterling arranged a credit facility to fund the  cash consideration of the acquisition of equipment finance  inc as part of the corporation s asset liability management  the corporation uses interest rate swaps and caps to manage interest rate risk associated with variable rate funding sources 
to the extent the derivatives are effective and meet the requirements for hedge accounting  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income with income statement reclassification occurring as the hedged item affects earnings 
conversely  changes in fair value attributable to ineffectiveness or to derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are recognized as they occur in the income statement s other expense account with the hedged item 
in  sterling entered into an interest rate swap transaction with an aggregate notional amount of  with a term of four years  to hedge its cash flow requirements under the line of credit to fund finance receivables 
according to the terms of the transaction  the corporation pays fixed rate interest rate payments and receives floating rate payments 
the swap was entered into to hedge the corporation s exposure to higher interest rates on its variable rate funding sources 
at december   the fair value of the cash flow swap was a negative  capital the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
sterling s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at each of the banking subsidiaries 
one capital management strategy that sterling employed during was the issuance of  of preferred capital securities through its wholly owned special purpose subsidiary trust  sterling financial statutory trust i 
the proceeds from the preferred securities were invested in junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of sterling  at terms consistent with the preferred capital securities 
sterling s treatment of the preferred capital securities is consistent with long term debt  and the related dividends being presented as interest expense 
dividends on the securities are variable at the rate equal to month libor  plus basis points  and adjusts quarterly 
the interest rate is at december  the preferred securities must be redeemed upon maturity of the subordinated debentures in march sterling s obligations under the debentures and related documents  taken together  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by sterling of the statutory trust s obligations under the preferred capital securities 
the preferred capital securities qualify for tier capital treatment for sterling 
as such  sterling was able to increase regulatory capital  without increasing stockholders equity 
earnings retention is a primary source of additional capital to sterling  which represents net income less dividends declared 
during  sterling retained  or  of its net income 
stockholders equity also increased as a result of  in other comprehensive income  which related to net unrealized gains on securities available for sale and unrealized losses on an interest rate swap 
during the first quarter of  sterling announced the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its outstanding common stock 
through december    shares have been repurchased under this program at an average price of  including  shares purchased in sterling and its banking subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on sterling and the subsidiary banks financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  sterling and its banking subsidiaries must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require sterling and its banking subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
management believes  as of december   and that sterling and the subsidiary banks met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and are categorized as well capitalized 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the subsidiary banks category

as of december   capacity to borrow from the fhlb totaled approximately million 
the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s cash outflows consist principally of dividends to shareholders and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main source of funding for the parent company is the dividends it receives from its banking subsidiaries 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid to the parent company from the subsidiary banks 
the total amount of dividends that may be paid from the subsidiary banks to sterling total million at december  sterling manages liquidity by monitoring projected cash inflows and outflows on a daily basis  and believes it has sufficient funding sources to maintain sufficient liquidity under varying degrees of business conditions 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements sterling enters into contractual obligations in its normal course of business to fund loan growth  for asset liability management purposes  to meet required capital needs and for other corporate purposes 
the following table presents significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date

derivative contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of the expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
the fair values of the contracts change daily as interest rates change 
these contracts require monthly cash settlement 
as the derivative liabilities recorded on the balance sheet do not represent the amounts that will ultimately be paid under the contract  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations discussed above 
further discussion of derivative instruments is included in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
a schedule of significant commitments at december  is as follows commitments to extend credit unused home equity lines of credit  other commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  further discussion of these commitments to extend credit is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  sterling has commitments and obligations under employee benefit plans as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sterling has no off balance sheet arrangements through the use of special purpose entities

this interpretation provides guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interest in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders for all financial statements issued after january  the new accounting provisions of this interpretation became effective upon issuance for all new variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies to the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  sterling is currently assessing the impact  if any  the interpretation will have on our accounting for special purpose entities and sterling s results of operations and financial position

other guarantees are subject to the disclosure requirements of fin but not to the recognition provisions and include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas  a parent s guarantee of debt owed to a third party by its subsidiary or vice versa  and a guarantee which is based on performance not price 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for sterling as of december   and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee see note 
the accounting recognition requirements of fin are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  adoption of fin will not have a material impact on sterling s results of operations or financial position 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
sterling s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  sterling derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms and rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
equity market risk is not a significant risk to the corporation  as equity investments on a cost basis comprise less than of corporate assets 
sterling does not have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the corporation s future earnings earnings at risk and value value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment  contractual interest rate changes  or the exercise of explicit or embedded options 
the primary objective of the corporation s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate yet is not essential to the corporation s profitability 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at a tolerable level 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the corporate asset liability committee is responsible for these decisions 
the corporation primarily uses the securities portfolios and fhlb advances to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
at present  the use of off balance sheet instruments is not significant 
the committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of risk 
these policies are approved by the boards of directors 
the corporation uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and net present value analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the corporation s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of the corporation s interest rate risk position over time 
earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of the corporation s shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period  with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the simulation analysis results are presented in the graph in table a 
these results as of december  indicate that the corporation would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease by if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
this profile reflects an asset sensitive short term rate risk position and is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   annual net interest income was expected to decrease by in the upward scenario and to increase by in the downward scenario 
the change in the risk position from year to year to an asset sensitive position reflects management s efforts throughout the year to extend liability maturities and shorten maturities in the investment portfolio  generally low level of interest rates which would preclude further reductions in certain deposit rates in the declining rate scenarios  and adoption of non maturity deposit sensitivity assumptions based on studies performed by a third party service provider that support a more significant lagging in the increase in the rates on these deposits in rising rate scenarios 
value at risk the net present value analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the net present value of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of the expected liability cash flows 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining the expected cash flows and in discounting the cash flows 
the resulting percentage change in net present value in various rate scenarios is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the net present value analysis results are presented in the graph in table b 
these results as of december  indicate that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to decrease if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the risk position of sterling is within the guidelines set by policy 
at december   the analysis indicated that the net present value would decrease assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of and to increase if rates shifted downward in the same manner 
the change in the analysis results from year to year highlight the longer term impact of the factors noted above  specifically management s efforts throughout the year to extend liability maturities and shorten maturities in the investment portfolio  generally low level of interest rates which would preclude further reductions in certain deposit rates in the declining rate scenarios but are expected to lag in rising rate scenarios  and adoption of non maturity deposit sensitivity assumptions based on studies performed by a third party service provider that supported longer assumed lives for these portfolios
