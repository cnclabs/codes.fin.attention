item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview organizational history we were formed in  and our common stock began trading publicly in the current endologix  inc resulted from the may acquisition of all of the capital stock of a private company  endologix  inc the former endologix and the subsequent change of our company name from radiance medical systems  inc to endologix  inc 
the terms of the merger are described below under the caption merger with former endologix  inc and also note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our business endologix is engaged in the development  manufacture  sales and marketing of minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of vascular disease 
our primary focus is the development of the powerlink system  a catheter based alternative treatment to surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms  or aaa 
aaa is a weakening of the wall of the aorta  the largest artery of the body 
once aaa develops  it continues to enlarge and if left untreated becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture 
the overall patient mortality rate for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is approximately 
aaa is the th leading cause of death in the united states 
the powerlink system is a catheter and endoluminal graft  or elg system 
the self expanding stainless steel cage is covered by eptfe  a common surgical graft material 
the powerlink elg is implanted in the abdominal aorta  gaining access through the femoral artery 
once deployed into its proper position  the blood flow is shunted away from the weakened or aneurismal section of the aorta  reducing pressure and the potential for the aorta to rupture 
we believe that implantation of the powerlink system will reduce the mortality and morbidity rates associated with conventional aaa surgery 
we are currently selling the powerlink system in europe  excluding france  which requires separate regulatory approval for aaa devices 
in february  we received preliminary notice of approval of our infrarenal device by the french ministry of health  or moh  and are awaiting a comprehensive statement of approval  which will detail any limitations for use  prior to beginning marketing the device 
we completed japanese clinical trials for our aaa technology in november and have submitted for japanese moh approval to commercialize the product 
we believe that japanese moh review should be completed in the second half of we are currently enrolling patients in two separate arms of a phase ii us clinical trial  one for an infrarenal and one for a suprarenal version of the powerlink system  to support a pre market approval  or pma  application with the fda in order to market the powerlink system in the united states 
the infrarenal and suprarenal devices are similar  except that the wire stent in the suprarenal device is extended above the graft material to allow the physician to anchor the top of the device above the renal arteries without obstructing them 
we believe that as of february  we had enrolled a sufficient number of patients in the infrarenal device arm of the study and that the enrollment for the suprarenal device should be completed in we have to follow the patients for months before final data collection and submission for pma to the fda 
prior to the acquisition of former endologix and the restructuring that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of see below under the captions merger with former endologix  inc and company restructuring and notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we were researching  developing and marketing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
prior to that we developed  manufactured and marketed other catheter and stent products for treatment of cardiovascular disease 
over the past few years  our source of revenues has shifted gradually from direct sales of catheter and stent products to royalties from licenses of our stent delivery technology 
in june  we licensed guidant corporation rights to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents 
in exchange  we received milestone payments based upon the transfer of know how to guidant  and continue to receive royalty payments based upon the sale of products by guidant using the focus technology 
the payments under the guidant license are the primary source of our existing revenues 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the guidant agreement 
we have experienced an operating loss for each of the last five years 
our results of operations have varied significantly from quarter to quarter  and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary significantly in the future 
our operating results depend upon several factors  including 
table of contents the timing and amount of expenses associated with clinical testing and development of the powerlink system and remaining clinical testing of the radiation catheter system  the progress and success of clinical trials and regulatory approvals  varying product sales by guidant corporation  our licensee  our ability to penetrate markets following regulatory approval  and  outcomes from future partnering or technology acquisition agreements  if any 
because the results we reported for the year ended december  only included the operating losses for former endologix for seven months  and we are enrolling patients in the pivotal clinical trials in the us and actively marketing our aaa products  we anticipate that our expenses will be substantially higher and result in operating losses through at least company restructuring in late  three companies published the first clinical study data for drug coated stents  a competing technology to our radiation catheter system 
while our rdx system uses beta radiation to treat restenosis resulting from angioplasty procedures  drug coated stents have drugs that inhibit cell proliferation to limit restenosis 
though drug coated stent feasibility trials were on a relatively small cohort of patients  all three companies reported restenosis rates near or at zero percent 
considering the efficacy  ease of use and probable cost effectiveness of drug coated stents compared to our radiation catheter system  we determined that the market for the radiation based system likely will be limited 
as a result  in order to conserve cash and to position ourselves to take advantage of strategic alternatives  we decided in september to restructure our operations 
our restructuring plan consisted of the following discontinue marketing and manufacturing of the radiation catheter system in europe and other international markets in the third quarter of discontinue marketing and manufacturing of products using our focus technology subject to fulfillment of outstanding orders  cease preparation for clinical trials for the radiation catheter system in japan  and  involuntary termination of employees  which we completed in the first quarter of as a result of our restructuring in the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded a  charge  comprised of manufacturing facility set up and sub license fees  for non cancelable commitments under the agreements with bebig gmbh  our european contract manufacturer   in other non cancelable commitments   for the write off of inventory that was not used to fulfill the outstanding focus technology product orders  million for employee involuntary termination benefits and  for other exit costs 
in addition  we concluded that certain equipment and intangible assets related to the radiation catheter technology  research and development and production were impaired  resulting in charges of  for equipment and million for intangible assets 
we also decided to cease manufacturing of the focus technology product line  subject to fulfillment of outstanding orders  and we recorded a charge of  for equipment used in the production of focus technology products 
we also wrote off  for the carrying value of furniture  computers  software and leasehold improvements that we were no longer using 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of facility needs and recorded a  restructuring charge for non cancelable lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income of  during the fourth quarter of  we reassessed our restructuring accrual for non cancelable 
table of contents lease commitments in light of diminished opportunity for sublease arrangements prior to the lease term expirations in october and recorded an additional restructuring charge 
following the restructuring  we assigned the remaining workforce to identify new technology and to complete the pivotal clinical trials for the radiation catheter and certain feasibility clinical trials 
as the clinical data for drug coated stents has continued to be very favorable  and we believe that drug coated stents will be approved for sale in the us in the first half of  we have decided to complete the clinical studies for the radiation catheter system  but not to file for pma approval in the us merger with former endologix  inc reasons for the merger in september  as part of the restructuring plan driven by the success of drug coated stents  we began investigating other medical device technologies for commercialization 
in the fourth quarter of  we began discussions with the privately held  former endologix  inc based on our investigation of the powerlink system  we believed that it was a novel device for treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms  and that clinical results to date indicated that the powerlink system had several features and benefits that may provide a better clinical outcome in comparison to devices currently on the market 
we believed that the acquisition of former endologix s technology would provide us with a new and unique medical device technology for a promising and potentially lucrative market 
merger transaction in may  we acquired all of the capital stock of former endologix 
we paid the former stockholders of former endologix cash for each share of former endologix common stock  for an aggregate of million  and one share of our common stock for each share of former endologix common stock  for an aggregate  shares 
at december   we had not yet paid  in cash and  shares of common stock remain to be delivered to shareholders of former endologix 
in addition  we agreed to pay contingent consideration in the amount of million in the event pre market approval  or pma  is received for the powerlink system on or before march   or million if pma approval is received by june  we may choose to pay the contingent consideration in cash or common stock at our sole discretion 
following the approval of the merger  we forgave a loan of  and accrued interest of  owed by our former chief executive officer and expensed  to administrative expenses 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase under sfas no 
 business combinations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocated the purchase price based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we retained an independent appraiser to assist in the identification and valuation of intangible assets 
as a result of the foregoing determinations  we expensed the portion of the purchase price allocated to in process research and development of million in the year ended december  we also determined the fair value of developed technology at the merger date to be million  which represents the acquired  aggregate fair value of individually identified technologies that were fully developed at the time of the merger 
as with the in process research and development  the developed technology was valued using the income approach and a discount rate of  in context of the business enterprise value of the former endologix 
we determined a value of million for trademarks and tradenames based upon the estimated royalty that would have to be paid for the right to use these assets if they had not been acquired by us  and a discount rate of 
the residual amount of million was allocated to goodwill 
the trademarks and trade names have an indefinite life and the developed technology is being amortized over ten years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description of the accounting for the merger 

table of contents significant accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowances for accounts receivable and inventory  long lived assets  including intangible assets  indefinite lived assets  and  income taxes 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we revised our estimate of demand for our focus technology products in  which resulted in the write down of inventory 
we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations  such as our decision to discontinue new sales of our focus product  adverse market conditions or the introduction of competing technologies  such as drug coated stents  among other things  could cause us to write down the asset ie  record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
our goodwill will be tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill is impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may continue to decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
we reduce our deferred tax assets to zero due to uncertainties concerning the future realization of the related tax benefits  primarily due to our history of losses 
in the event we were to determine that it would be able to realize some or all of the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance would be reduced  resulting in increased income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales decreased to  in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   as a result of the discontinuance of manufacturing and marketing of our focus technology and rdx products as part of our restructuring plan 
the discontinuance of those product lines was partially offset by product sales for seven months of of our aaa products  following the merger with the former endologix 
license revenue 
license revenue increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  our technology license agreement with 
table of contents guidant resulted in million and million in royalties in and  respectively 
we recognized  in minimum royalties in and  in minimum royalties in  under our agreement with escalon medical corporation escalon 
we currently do not expect to receive more than the minimum royalties due under the escalon agreement  which we will recognize as revenue when cash is collected due to the uncertainty of collection 
we recognized  in deferred distributor fees in and  in under a distribution agreement with cosmotec ltd 
of japan cosmotec 
as the agreement with cosmotec regarded the distribution of our radiation therapy products in japan through our joint venture  and in december we agreed with the distributor not to distribute the products and to dissolve the joint venture  we recognized the remaining deferred distributor fee of  as revenue 
changes in guidant s sales of licensed products will significantly impact future revenues 
although the license agreement with guidant expires in june  if at any time guidant discontinued selling licensed products  we would not receive royalties from them in excess of the minimum annual amount of  in september  we believe that guidant replaced certain licensed products with unlicensed products in the us market 
as a result  royalties on licensed products sales dropped to  in the fourth quarter of compared to million recorded in the fourth quarter of we anticipate a continuing reduction in royalties from guidant in based upon guidant s sale of unlicensed products and competition from drug coated stents  which we believe will begin in the first half of cost of product sales 
the cost of product sales decreased to  in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to a lower average cost of sales for aaa products  compared with that for our former focus technology and rdx products sold in  partially offset by a one time  charge for product exchanges as part of the settlement and release agreement with european distributors see note to consolidated financial statements regarding the settlement and release agreement  and a decrease in product sales to  in from million in cost of sales from restructuring 
due to our restructuring and discontinuance of the marketing of existing products ie  focus technology and rdx products that we announced in the third quarter of  we wrote off  of inventory that would not be used to fulfill existing customer orders 
we did not have any corresponding write offs of inventory in due to the restructuring 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in gross profit was due primarily an inventory write off of  in as a result of the restructuring and to sales of higher margin aaa products in gross profit on product sales increased to  in the year ended december  from in the year ended december   due primarily to sales of higher margin aaa products in  partially offset by an  charge for product exchanges as part of the settlement and release agreement with two european distributors see note to consolidated financial statements regarding the settlement and release agreement  and an inventory write off of  in as a result of the restructuring 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to discontinued research and development projects as part of our september restructuring plan 
corresponding expenses on aaa research and development did not commence until the merger with the former endologix 
because we are conducting research and development projects and a pivotal us clinical trial  and plan future clinical trials  we anticipate higher research and development expenses for marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses decreased to  in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily the result of our discontinuance of marketing and sales of our then existing products as part of our september restructuring plan 
during  we plan to focus our efforts on us and japan clinical approval and will sell our products primarily through distributors 
we anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will be comparable to the total expenses for 
table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was due primarily to lower legal expenses  relating mainly to the endosonics corporation lawsuit see note to the consolidated financial statements  and lower bad debt expense in  as bad debt expense of  net of recoveries  in was due primarily to the restructuring 
we anticipate that the total general and administrative expense for will be materially higher than for  since results only include seven months of expenses of the combined companies  following the merger with the former endologix 
charge for acquired in process research and development 
we recognized a charge of million in the year ended december  as a result of the merger with the former endologix see note to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges 
we recognized restructuring charges totaling  in the year ended december  based upon our reassessment and elimination of estimated sub lease income we anticipated receiving to offset rent expenditures for non cancelable lease commitments 
other income expense 
other income decreased to  for the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in other income was due primarily to the decrease in interest income of  resulting from the use of million in cash as merger consideration to the shareholders of the former endologix in  coupled with continuing losses from operations 
comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   as a result of increased competition for angioplasty catheter and stent products and the discontinuance of product sales in late as a result of our restructuring 
license revenue 
license revenue decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  for both years  royalties from guidant were million 
in addition  we recognized  in minimum royalties in and  in minimum royalties in  under our agreement with escalon cost of product sales 
cost of product sales decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this decrease was attributable primarily to the decrease in product sales  partially offset by an increase of  due to inventory reserves for expired products 
cost of sales from restructuring 
due to our restructuring and discontinuance of the marketing of existing products  we wrote off  of inventory that would not be used to fulfill existing customer orders 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in gross profit for the year ended december  was due primarily to the inventory write off of  as a result of the restructuring  a decrease in product sales of million  and a decrease in license revenue of  under the escalon agreement 
gross profit on product sales decreased to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december   due primarily to the decrease in product sales of million 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to additional spending on clinical trials and development of pilot production for the rdx system 

table of contents marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased to million in the year ended december   from  in the year ended december   primarily as a result of the expiration of a marketing allowance for cathex  our japanese focus technology distributor  in the fourth quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   primarily due to lower bonus and payroll expenses from personnel reductions 
restructuring charges 
we recognized restructuring charges totaling million in the year ended december  the charges consisted of a million impairment charge for previously acquired rdx developed technology  million of involuntary employee termination costs  a  impairment charge for manufacturing and other operating assets   charge  comprised of manufacturing facility setup and sub license fees and non cancelable commitments under agreements with bebig   in other non cancelable commitments   of non cancelable lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income of  and  of other non cancelable commitments and exit costs 
other income expense 
other income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  interest income was million in each of the years ended december  and gain on sale of assets decreased to  in from million in the primary source for the gain on sale of assets was the sale of an option to purchase an equity investment  which expired without exercise in december liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily by selling our equity securities  licensing our technologies  commercial sales  and entering into international product distribution agreements 
prior to our initial public offering in  we raised an aggregate of approximately million from the private sales of preferred and common stock 
in  we closed our initial public offering of common stock  with net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other expenses of the offering 
in we raised an aggregate of  through private sales of common stock to strategic partners 
in  we granted cosmotec co  ltd of japan the exclusive distribution rights to market our vascular radiation therapy products in japan 
we received million from cosmotec as an upfront cash payment 
as part of the transaction with cosmotec  in august we acquired a interest  for  in a joint venture with an affiliate of cosmotec 
the joint venture was formed to gain regulatory approval of and provide distribution for the radiation catheter system in japan 
however  under the restructuring plan  we discontinued preparations for japanese clinical trials 
in december  we agreed with cosmotec and its affiliate to dissolve the joint venture 
in june  we borrowed million from cosmotec and recorded million in debt to reflect the fair value of the  million face amount convertible debenture 
in september  cosmotec converted the debenture into  shares of our common stock at per share 
in october  we sold in a secondary offering  shares of our common stock held in treasury and  shares of our newly issued common stock 
we received million in net proceeds  after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and other expenses 

table of contents in july  the board of directors authorized a program for repurchases of our outstanding common stock of up to l 
million under certain parameters 
as of december   we have repurchased an aggregate of  shares for  in october  we repaid a  million convertible debenture and accrued interest due to cosmotec that was assumed in the merger with the former endologix 
net cash used by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used by operating activities of million during the year ended december  the decrease in net cash used for resulted primarily from our restructuring and reduced operating levels for the first five months of  prior to the merger with former endologix 
in february  the former endologix agreed to purchase a key component for its powerlink product from impra  inc  a subsidiary of cr bard  inc and then a related party  under a supplier agreement that expires in december  and which then automatically renews  on a year by year basis  for additional one year periods without notice  unless a party provides notice not to renew within thirty days from the expiration of the renewal period 
under the terms of the agreement  we have agreed to purchase certain unit quantities of the component  with built in annual quantity increases  or the agreement may be canceled 
in january  the agreement was amended  increasing the minimum quantity purchase requirements for and thereafter and increasing the prices each year after according to the general increase in the consumer price index 
during the seven months following the merger with the former endologix  we purchased  in materials under the supplier agreement 
in  because the mix of product we will purchase is currently uncertain  we anticipate buying between  and million in materials 
if we receive fda approval to commercially distribute devices using the component  the price that we will pay impra for the component will materially increase 
we believe that us commercialization could occur during we are economically dependent on this vendor as it is the sole source for the key component 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial costs and cash outlays in to support powerlink research and development 
for the years ended december  and  we have incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and cash generated by operations are sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures through at least december  unanticipated reductions in royalty revenue  failure of the market to accept our products  or failure to reduce certain discretionary expenditures  if necessary  could have a material adverse effect on the our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our research and development programs the scope and results of clinical trials  the regulatory approval process  the costs involved in intellectual property rights enforcement or litigation  competitive products  the establishment of manufacturing capacity  the emphasis on sales and marketing capabilities  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other parties  and  the ability to develop technology and to commercialize products 
we anticipate raising funds in in order to prepare for a mid us market launch of the powerlink product and to fund operations through additional financings  including debt  private or public equity offerings and collaborative arrangements with existing or new corporate partners 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds on favorable terms  or at all 
equity financings may dilute the interests of the existing shareholders 
if we obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others  we may be required to grant rights to certain technologies or products that we would not otherwise grant 

table of contents accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable  net  increased to  at december  from  at december  the increase is due to powerlink product sales in the last seven months of  while we had discontinued sales of products that existed at the time of our restructuring 
other receivables 
other receivables decreased to million at december  from million at december  due primarily to a decrease of the royalty receivable from guidant of million and of investment income receivable of  see comparisons of years ended december  and in subsections license revenue  regarding guidant royalty revenues  and other income expense sections  regarding interest income  above 
inventories 
inventories increased to million at december  from  at december  the increase was due to powerlink product inventory  while we had discontinued manufacturing of products that existed at the time of our restructuring 
goodwill 
goodwill increased to million at december  from zero at december  the increase in goodwill was due to the allocation of a portion of the purchase price of the former endologix to goodwill 
intangibles 
intangibles  net increased to million at december  from zero at december  the increase in intangibles was due to the allocation of a portion of the purchase price of the former endologix to developed technology of million  trademarks and tradenames of million  net of accumulated amortization of developed technology of  accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was attributable to lower accruals for restructuring charges of  including  for involuntary employee terminations and  for non cancelable commitments  and clinical expenses of  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and other expense accruals of  deferred revenue 
deferred revenue decreased to zero at december  from  at december  in december  we agreed with cosmotec  and its affiliate  our joint venture partner  to release each other from the distribution and joint venture agreements  respectively  as we had no plans to pursue regulatory approval of the rdx product  and to dissolve the joint venture  radiatec 
as a result  we recognized the remaining amount of deferred revenue in see note to the consolidated financial statements

these statements discuss future expectations  projections or results of operations or of financial condition or state other forward looking information 
when considering these forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements we make 
these risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
risks related to our business we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability 
from our formation in to december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  and incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december  while we expect to be profitable in  assuming we receive us fda approval for our aaa infrarenal device  it is possible that we may never achieve profitability 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals for the powerlink aaa system 
we need to complete a us pivotal human clinical trial for the powerlink system 
the powerlink system is the only product we have under development and it has not been approved for marketing by the food and drug administration  or fda 
prior to granting approval  the fda may require more information or clarification of information provided in our regulatory submissions  or more clinical studies  which could require significant additional expenditures 
if granted  the fda may impose limitations on the uses for which or how we may market the powerlink system 
should we experience delays or be unable to obtain regulatory approvals  we may never generate significant revenues  and our business prospects will be substantially impaired 
in japan  we have completed our clinical trials for the powerweb system and are working with the ministry of health for regulatory approval 
while we believe that we will receive regulatory approval in japan in the second half of  because this is the first aaa device submitted for approval  it is difficult for us to determine when or whether the device will be approved 
if we receive regulatory approval for our products and decide to market them  we will need to grow rapidly 
rapid growth may strain the capabilities of our managers  operations and facilities and  consequently  could harm our business 
if we obtain the required u 
s 
regulatory approval for the powerlink system  commercial scale production will require us to expand our operations 
rapid growth may strain our managerial and other organizational resources 
our ability to manage our growth will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage the simultaneous manufacture of different products efficiently and integrate the manufacture of new products with existing product lines  address difficulties in scaling up production of new products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply and shortages of qualified personnel  and  implement and improve our operational  management information and financial control systems 
we rely on a single vendor to supply our graft material for the powerlink system  and any disruption in our supply could delay or prevent us from completing our clinical trials or from producing the product for sale 
currently  we rely on impra  a subsidiary of cr bard  to supply us with graft  which is a primary component for the powerlink system 
our reliance on sole source suppliers exposes our operations to disruptions in supply caused by failure of our supplier to comply with regulatory requirements  any strike or work stoppage  disruptions in shipping  a natural disaster caused by fire  floods or earthquakes  a supply shortage experienced by our sole source supplier  and the fiscal health and manufacturing strength of our sole source supplier 
although we retain a significant stock of the graft material  the occurrence of any of the above disruptions in supply or other unforeseen events that could cause a disruption in supply from our sole 
table of contents source graft supplier may cause us to halt or delay our clinical trials 
because we do not have alternative suppliers  our sales and profitability would be harmed in the event of a disruption 
we are currently only developing a single technology  the powerlink system 
because of limited resources  we are currently only developing a single technology  the powerlink system 
if we are unable to commercialize the powerlink system and reach positive cash flow from operations  we may not be able to fund development and commercialization of an alternative technology 
our operations are capital intensive  and we may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund our operations 
our activities are capital intensive 
our current cash balance may not be sufficient to reach fda approval for the powerlink system 
although we believe that our existing cash resources and anticipated cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our planned capital requirements through at least december   we will require additional capital thereafter to fund on going operations  including our anticipated product launch in the us in the second half of our cash requirements in the future may be significantly different from our current estimates and depend on many factors  including the scope and results of our clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents or any litigation by third parties regarding intellectual property  the establishment of high volume manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  and  our success in entering into collaborative relationships with other parties 
to finance these activities  we may seek funds through additional rounds of financing  including private or public equity or debt offerings and collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
we may be unable to raise funds on favorable terms  or not at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we issue debt securities  these securities could have rights superior to holders of our common stock  and could contain covenants that will restrict our operations 
we might have to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to our technologies  product candidates or products that we otherwise would not relinquish 
if adequate funds are not available  we might have to delay  scale back or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which would impair our future prospects 
our primary source of revenues is our focus technology license agreement with guidant 
our current and future revenues depend on the number of stent delivery systems that incorporate our focus technology that are sold by guidant corporation 
under our license agreement  we receive royalty payments only from guidant s sale of products using the focus technology 
approximately of our total revenues in the year ended december  were from guidant 
our license revenues declined substantially following the release of unlicensed products by guidant and may continue to decline precipitously 
in any event  we expect that our revenues from guidant will decline over the next few years as technological changes in the stent market make our focus stent technology obsolete 
moreover  in the first half of  we anticipate drug coated stents will be introduced in the us market  and sales by guidant of royalty bearing products could decline substantially 
we will need to devote significant resources to market our products and technology to physicians in order to achieve market acceptance 
if we fail to achieve market acceptance  our business will suffer 
because the fda and other regulatory agencies have approved other minimally invasive aaa graft systems  we believe that unless we can demonstrate clinically superior results and are able to convince 
table of contents physicians of the superiority of the device  we may not be able to successfully market the products 
other companies may have superior resources to market similar products or technologies or have superior technologies and products to market 
therefore  even if our products gain regulatory approval  we will need to spend significant resources prior to achieving market acceptance 
any failure of our products to achieve commercial acceptance  or any inability on our part to devote the requisite resources necessary to market our products  will harm our business 
we may rely on third party distributors to sell and market any product we develop 
they may do so ineffectively 
we may depend on medical device distributors and strategic relationships  some of which may be with our competitors  to distribute the powerlink system or any other product we develop 
significant consolidation among medical device suppliers has made it increasingly difficult for smaller suppliers like us to distribute products effectively without a relationship with one or more of the major suppliers 
consequently  we may enter into agreements with third parties to distribute any product we develop 
if we enter into such relationships  we will depend directly on their efforts to market the any product we develop  yet we will be unable to control their efforts completely 
if our distributors fail to market and sell our products effectively  our operating results and business may suffer substantially  or we may have to make significant additional expenditures to market our products 
the market for our products is highly competitive  and competing medical device technologies may prove more effective in treating these conditions than our product candidates 
competition in the market for devices used in the treatment of vascular disease is intense  and we expect it to increase 
the powerlink system and other potential products will compete with treatment methods that are well established in the medical community  as well as treatments based on new technologie 
we face competition from manufacturers of other catheter based aaa graft devices and pharmaceutical products intended to treat vascular disease 
the most significant devices that pose a competitive challenge to us include guidant s ancure  medtronic s aneurx and w 
l 
gore s excluder aaa system which are available in the us and europe  other aaa graft systems by medtronic  cook  johnson and johnson  edwards life sciences  currently with more limited availability  and other technologies in various phases of development  including pharmaceutical solutions 
any of these treatments could prove to be more effective or may achieve greater market acceptance than the powerlink system 
even if these treatments are not as effective as the powerlink system  many of the companies pursuing these treatments and technologies have significantly greater financial  management and other resources  more extensive research and development capability  established market positions  and  larger sales and marketing organizations 
in addition  we believe that many of the purchasers and potential purchasers of our competitors products prefer to purchase medical devices from a single source 
accordingly  many of our competitors  because of their size and range of product offerings  will have an advantage over us 

table of contents our future operating results are difficult to predict and may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this fluctuation may negatively impact our stock price in the future 
because the powerlink system is still in the research and development phase  we cannot predict when  if ever  we will have revenues based on the us sales of the powerlink system 
also  our current revenues are attributable primarily to a license agreement with guidant  which limits our ability to predict future revenues 
moreover  we expect revenues pursuant to the license agreement with guidant to diminish in the future as technology changes 
in addition to the foregoing factors  our quarterly revenues and results of operations have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to the conduct of clinical trials  the timing of regulatory approvals  fluctuations in our expenses associated with expanding our operations  new product introductions both in the united states and internationally  variations in foreign exchange rates  and  changes in third party payors reimbursement policies 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparison of our operating results may not necessarily be reliable indicators of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future period our operating results will not meet your expectations or those of public market analysts 
any unanticipated change in revenues or operating results is likely to cause our stock price to fluctuate since such changes reflect new information available to investors and analysts 
new information may cause investors and analysts to revalue our stock  which could causea decline in value 
risks related to our industry our products and manufacturing activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation that could make it more expensive and time consuming for us to introduce new and improved products 
our products must comply with regulatory requirements imposed by the fda and similar agencies in foreign countries 
these requirements involve lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities  an extensive fda review process and other costly and time consuming procedures 
it often takes companies several years to satisfy these requirements  depending on the complexity and novelty of the product 
we also are subject to numerous additional licensing and regulatory requirements relating to safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
some of the most important requirements we face include fda pre market approval process  california department of health services requirements  iso en certification  and  european union ce mark requirements 
government regulation may impede our ability to conduct clinical trials and to manufacture the powerlink system and other prospective products 
government regulation also could delay our marketing of new products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures on our activities 
the fda and other regulatory agencies may not approve any of our products on a timely basis  if at all 
any delay in 
table of contents obtaining  or failure to obtain  such approvals could impede our marketing of any proposed products and reduce our product revenues 
in addition  even after receipt of approval and market launch  our products remain subject to strict regulatory controls on manufacture  marketing and use 
we may be forced to modify or recall our product after release 
any such action could have a material affect on the reputation of our products and on our business and financial position 
further  regulations may change  and any additional regulation could limit or restrict our ability to use any of our technologies  which could harm our business 
we also could be subject to new federal  state or local regulations that could affect our research and development programs and harm our business in unforeseen ways 
if this happens  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations 
we cannot predict the extent to which third party payors may provide reimbursement for the use of our products 
our success in marketing products based on novel or innovative technology depends in large part on whether domestic and international government health administrative authorities  private health insurers and other organizations will reimburse customers for the cost of our product 
reimbursement systems in international markets vary significantly by country and by region within some countries  and reimbursement approvals must be obtained on a country by country basis 
further  many international markets have government managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
in most markets there are private insurance systems as well as government managed systems 
we cannot assure you that sufficient reimbursement will be available for any product that we may develop  in either the united states or internationally  to establish and maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on the development of our new products 
if government and third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our new products  it will be very difficult for us to market our products to doctors and hospitals  and we may not achieve commercial success 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property from infringement 
a failure to protect our technology may affect our business negatively 
the market for medical devices is subject to frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
it is possible that our patents or licenses may not withstand challenges made by others or protect our rights adequately 
our success depends in large part on our ability to secure effective patent protection for our products and processes in the united states and internationally 
we have filed and intend to continue to file patent applications for various aspects of our technology 
however  we face the risks that we may fail to secure necessary patents prior to or after obtaining regulatory clearances  thereby permitting competitors to market competing products  and our already granted patents may be re examined  re issued or invalidated 
we also own trade secrets and confidential information that we try to protect by entering into confidentiality agreements with other parties 
we cannot be certain that any of the confidentiality agreements will be honored or  if breached  that we would have enough remedies to protect our confidential information 
further  our competitors may independently learn our trade secrets or develop similar or superior technologies 
to the extent that our consultants  key employees or others apply technological information to our projects that they develop independently or others develop  disputes may arise regarding the ownership of proprietary rights to such information and there is no guarantee that such disputes will be resolved in our favor 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  our business and commercial prospects likely will suffer 

table of contents if our current products or licensed products infringe upon the intellectual property of our competitors  the sale of these products may be challenged and we may have to defend costly and time consuming infringement claims 
we may need to engage in expensive and prolonged litigation to assert any of our rights or to determine the scope and validity of rights claimed by other parties 
with no certainty as to the outcome  litigation could be too expensive for us to pursue 
our failure to pursue litigation could result in the loss of our rights that could hurt our business substantially 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  if at all 
our failure to obtain rights to intellectual property of third parties or the potential for intellectual property litigation could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling  making or using our products that use the disputed intellectual property  obtain a license from the intellectual property owner to continue selling  making  licensing or using our products  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  redesign our products or services  and subject us to significant liabilities to third parties 
if any of the foregoing occurs  we may be unable to manufacture and sell our products or license our technology and may suffer severe financial harm 
whether or not an intellectual property claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could harm our business 
we may face product liability that could result in costly litigation and significant liabilities 
clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of our products may expose us to product liability claims 
although we have  and intend to maintain insurance  the coverage limits of our insurance policies may not be adequate and one or more successful claims brought against us may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  adverse product liability actions could negatively affect the reputation and sales of our products and our ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval for our products 
other risks the price of our stock may fluctuate unpredictably in response to factors unrelated to our operating performance 
the stock market periodically experiences significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to drop 
in particular  the market price of securities of small medical device companies  like ours  has been very unpredictable and may vary in response to announcements by us or our competitors concerning technological innovations  introductions of new products  fda and foreign regulatory actions  developments or disputes relating to patents or proprietary rights  failure of our results of operations to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors  changes in stock market analyst recommendations regarding our common stock  
table of contents changes in healthcare policy in the united states or other countries  and general stock market conditions 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and inhibit your ability to receive a premium price for your shares 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our business  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights and preferences of such shares without stockholder approval 
any such issuance could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire our business and may adversely affect the rights of our stockholders 
in addition  our board of directors is divided into three classes for staggered terms of three years 
these provisions may delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us  adversely affecting the market price of our common stock 
substantial future sales of our common stock in the public market may depress our stock price and make it difficult for you to recover the full value of your investment in our shares 
most of our outstanding shares of common stock are freely tradable 
the market price of our common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares or the perception that such sales could occur 
these factors also could make it more difficult to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
we have approximately  shares of common stock outstanding  net of treasury stock 
all of these shares are freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  sfas no

the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio included only high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper and government bonds all with remaining maturities of less than two years 
the table below provides information about our available for sale investment portfolio 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average fixed interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in the subsequent twelve month periods ending december fair value at december  total in thousands  except interest rates cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate investments weighted average interest rate total portfolio weighted average interest rate foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure as the majority of our assets are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transactions are not material 
accordingly  we do not have a significant currency exposure at december
