critical accounting policies sjw corp 
has identified accounting policies below as the policies critical to the business operations and the understanding of the results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
sjw corp 
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on the company s business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows balancing account the california public utilities commission cpuc establishes a balancing account mechanism within its regulatory regime 
a separate balancing account must be maintained for each offset expense item eg  purchased water  purchased power and pump tax 
the purpose of a balancing account is to track the under collection or over collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the cpuc to offset those expense changes 
since balances are being tracked and have to be approved by the cpuc before they can be incorporated into rates  san jose water company has not recognized the balancing account in its financial statements 
had the balancing account under collection been recognized in san jose water company s financial statements  san jose water company s earnings would have been increased by the amount of balancing account under collection 
as of december   the balancing account had a net under collected balance of  please also see factors that may affect future results 
accrued unbilled revenue san jose water company reads the majority of its customers meters on a bi monthly basis and records its revenue based on its meter reading results 
revenues from the meter reading date to the end of the accounting period is estimated based on historical usage patterns  production records and the effective tariff rates 
the estimate of the unbilled revenue is a management estimate utilizing certain sets of assumptions and conditions which include the number of days between meter reads for each billing cycle  the customers consumption changes  and the company s experiences in unaccounted for water 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which would result in operating revenue being adjusted in the period that the revision to the company s estimates is determined 
as of december  and  accrued unbilled revenue was  and  respectively 
recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities generally accepted accounting principles for water utilities include the recognition of regulatory assets and liabilities as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 san jose water company records deferred costs and credits on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that these costs and credits will be recovered in the ratemaking process in a period different from when the costs and credits were incurred 
accounting for such costs and credits is based on management s judgments that it is probable that these costs will be recoverable in the future revenue of the company through the ratemaking process 
the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded by san jose water company primarily relate to the recognition of deferred income taxes for ratemaking versus tax accounting purposes 
the disallowance of any asset in future ratemaking purposes  including the deferred regulatory assets  would require san jose water company to immediately recognize the impact of the costs for financial reporting purposes 
income taxes sjw corp 
estimates its federal and state income taxes as part of the process of preparing the financial statements 
the process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
pension accounting san jose water company offers a defined benefit plan  supplemental executive retirement plan and certain post retirement benefits other than pensions to employees retiring with a minimum level of service 
accounting for pensions and other post retirement benefits requires an extensive use of assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  the rate of future compensation increase received by the employees  mortality  turnover and medical costs 
see assumptions and disclosures detailed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
san jose water company  through its retirement plan administrative committee managed by the representatives from the unions and management establishes investment guidelines with specification that at least of the investments are in bonds or cash 
as of december   the plan assets consist of bonds  cash and equities 
furthermore  equities are to be diversified by industry groups to balance for capital appreciation and income 
in addition  all investments are publicly traded 
the company uses an expected rate of return on plan assets of in its actuarial computation that is below the company s annualized actual rate of return of measured from through the distributions of assets are conservative and are less affected by market volatility 
furthermore  foreign assets are not included in the investment profile and thus a risk related to foreign exchange fluctuation is eliminated 
the market values of the plan assets are marked to market at the measurement date 
the investment trust assets suffered significant unrealized market losses in the last two years 
significant unrealized market losses on pension assets are amortized over years for actuarial expense calculation purposes 
market losses in increased expense by approximately  in the san jose water company utilizes moody s a and aa rated bonds in industrial  utility and financial sectors with outstanding amount of million or more in determining the discount rate used in calculating the liabilities at the measurement date

 usage and new customers  pump tax and purchased water price increase   energy price increase  total production costs   other operating expense   maintenance property taxes and other nonincome taxes depreciation and amortization  the increase in production costs was primarily due to an increase in santa clara valley water district scvwd water production rates pump tax and purchased water in july  and energy cost increases 
water production  however  was similar to  and was consistent with the changes in customer consumption 
additional energy costs were also incurred due to the scheduled maintenance of a scvwd treatment plant  altering the company s distribution mix and optimal pumping pattern for san jose water company s water supply is obtained from wells  surface run off and diversion and by purchases from the scvwd 
surface water supply is the least expensive source of water and the availability of a slightly higher surface water supply reduced water production costs in during the year  san jose water company purchased more imported water than pumped water  which became more expensive as a result of an increase in energy costs 
consolidated operating expense in  excluding income taxes and production costs  increased  compared to the increases included  in pension costs primarily as a result of the decline in the market value of retirement trust assets   in salaries and wages in accordance with bargaining unit wage escalation and new hires   in additional professional fees and  in insurance costs 
depreciation increased  due to higher investment in utility plants 
consolidated operating expense in  excluding income taxes  increased  or  in comparison with due primarily to reduced surface water supply  the scvwd production cost pump tax and purchased water price increases in july  and the energy provider s power cost increases

increases in operation and maintenance expenses for the year ended were more than offset by the reduction in the merger related costs incurred in the year ended and the regulatory adjustment authorized by the cpuc 
the merger related costs were incurred in conjunction with the proposed merger of sjw corp 
with american water works company  inc the proposed merger was terminated on march  depreciation expense increased due to additions to the utility assets

liquidity and capital resources san jose water company s budgeted capital expenditures for  exclusive of capital expenditures financed by customer contributions and advances  are as follows budgeted capital expenditures in thousands water treatment  reservoirs and tanks  pump stations and equipment  distribution system  equipment and other  the capital expenditures budget is concentrated in main replacements 
approximately  will be spent to replace san jose water company s aging mains 
starting in  san jose water company began a four phased infrastructure study establishing a systematic approach to replace its utility facilities 
phase iv was completed in july of phase i and ii of the infrastructure study analyzed the company s pipes and mains 
phase iii and iv examined all other utility facilities 
the infrastructure study will be used as a guide for future capital improvement programs  and serve as the master plan for the company s replacement program for the next years 
san jose water company s capital expenditures are incurred in connection with normal upgrading and expansion of existing facilities and to comply with environmental regulations 
san jose water company expects to incur approximately  exclusive of customer contributions and advances  in capital expenditures over the next five years 
the company s actual capital expenditures may vary from its projections due to changes in the expected demand for services  weather patterns  and actions by governmental agencies and general economic conditions 
total additions to utility plant normally exceed company financed additions by several million dollars because certain new facilities are constructed using advances from developers and contributions in aid of construction 
a substantial portion of san jose water company s distribution system was constructed during the period from to expenditure levels for renewal and modernization of this part of the system will grow at an increasing rate as these components reach the end of their useful lives 
in most cases  replacement cost will significantly exceed the original installation cost of the retired assets due to increases in the costs of goods and services 
in  sjw corp 
invested  in crystal choice water service llc related to its share of capital investment 
the capital is invested primarily in rental equipment used by crystal choice water service llc in its rental operation 
the water utility business is highly seasonal in nature 
customer consumption demand during summer months could significantly exceed that of winter months 
operating revenue  accounts receivable and unbilled revenue increase as customer consumption increases 
historically  san jose water company s write offs for uncollectible accounts represent less than of its total revenue 
management believes it can continue to collect its accounts receivable balances at its historical collection rate 
sources of capital san jose water company s ability to finance future construction programs and sustain dividend payments depends on its ability to attract external financing and maintain or increase internally generated funds 
the level of future earnings and the related cash flow from operations is dependent  in large part  upon the timing and outcome of regulatory proceedings 
san jose water company has outstanding  of unsecured senior notes as of december  the senior note agreements of san jose water company generally have terms and conditions that restrict the company from issuing additional funded debt if the funded debt would exceed of total capitalization  and net income available for interest charges for the trailing twelve calendar month period would be less than of interest charges 
as of december   san jose water company s funded debt was of total capitalization and the net income available for interest charges was of interest charges

the partnership is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
factors that may affect future results the business of sjw corp 
and its subsidiaries may be adversely affected by new and changing legislation  policies and regulations 
new legislation and changes in existing legislation by federal  state and local governments and administrative agencies can affect the operations of sjw corp 
and its subsidiaries 
san jose water company is regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc 
almost all the operating revenue of san jose water company results from the sale of water at rates authorized by the cpuc 
the cpuc sets rates that are intended to provide revenues sufficient to recover operating expenses and produce a reasonable return on common equity 
san jose water company files and processes general rate applications with the cpuc on a periodic basis 
the most recent rate decision relating to san jose water company  approved in april  authorized a return on common equity in  and of 
we believe this is within the range of recent rates of return authorized by the cpuc for water utilities 
pursuant to this rate decision  san jose water company received a rate increase effective january  san jose water company will file a rate application in for rates scheduled to become effective in  and although the company believes that the rates currently in effect provide it with a reasonable rate of return  there is no guarantee such rates will be sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return in the future 
there is no guarantee that the company s future rate filings will be able to obtain a satisfactory rate of return in a timely manner 
in addition  san jose water company relies on policies and regulations promulgated by the cpuc in order to  for example  recover capital expenditures  maintain favorable treatment on gains from the sale of real property  offset its production and operating costs  recover the cost of debt  maintain an optimal equity structure without over leveraging  and have financial and operational flexibility to engage in non regulated operations 
if the cpuc implements policies and regulations that do not allow san jose water company to accomplish some or all of the items listed above  san jose water company s operating results may be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the california public utilities code  a balancing account must be kept for each expense item for which revenue offsets have been authorized ie  purchased water  purchased power and pump tax 
the purpose of a balancing account is to track the under collection or over collection associated with expense changes and the revenue authorized by the cpuc to offset those expense changes 
on november   the cpuc issued resolution w resolution implementing significant changes in the long established offset rate increase and balancing account recovery procedures applicable to water utilities 
these changes could have a significant impact on the risk profile of the water industry 
as required by the resolution  in december  the commission opened an order instituting rulemaking oir to evaluate existing balancing account and offset rate practices and policies 
on december   the cpuc issued an interim oir decision addressing the procedures for recovery of balancing accounts existing prior to november  pursuant to the decision  utilities may recover the balancing account balances accrued prior to november  if the utility is not over earning as measured on a pro forma basis 
the utilities are required to file a request for such recovery before march  at this time  it is unclear whether san jose water company s ability to recover all of the balancing account balance of  accrued prior to november  will be impacted 
furthermore  it is uncertain how any future cpuc regulation dealing with balancing account balances accrued after november  will affect san jose water company s ability to collect this balance or to receive future offset rate relief 
for the period from november  to december   the balancing account accumulated an over collection of  to be refunded to the customers 
changes in water supply  water supply costs or the mix of water supply could adversely affect the operating results and business of san jose water company 
san jose water company s supply of water primarily relies upon three main sources water purchased from the santa clara valley water district scvwd  surface water from its santa cruz mountain watershed  and pumped underground water 
changes and variations in quantities from each of these three sources affects the overall mix of the water supply  therefore affecting the cost of water supply 
surface water is the least costly source of water 
if there is an adverse change to the mix of water supply and san jose water company is not allowed to recover the additional or increased water supply costs  its operating results may be adversely affected 
the scvwd receives an allotment of water from state and federal water projects 
if san jose water company has difficulties obtaining a high quality water supply from the scvwd due to availability and legal restrictions  it may not be able to satisfy customer demand in its service area and its operating results and business may be adversely affected 
additionally  the availability of water from san jose water company s santa cruz mountain watershed depends on the weather and fluctuates with each season 
in a normal year  surface water supply provides of the total water supply of the system 
in a dry season with little rainfall  water supply from surface water sources may be low  thereby causing san jose water company to increase the amount of water purchased from outside sources at a higher cost than surface water and thus increasing water production costs 
in addition  san jose water company s ability to use surface water is subject to regulations regarding water quality and volume limitations 
if new regulations are imposed or existing regulations are changed or given new interpretations  the availability of surface water may be materially reduced 
a reduction in surface water could result in the need to procure more costly water from other sources  thereby increasing the water production costs and adversely affecting the operating results of san jose water company 
because the extraction of water from the groundwater basin and the operation of the water distribution system requires a significant amount of energy  increases in energy prices could increase operating expenses of san jose water company 
san jose water company continues to utilize pacific gas electric s time of use rate schedules to minimize its overall energy costs primarily for groundwater pumping 
during the winter months  typically or more of the groundwater is produced during off peak hours when electrical energy is the cheapest 
optimization and energy management efficiency is achieved through the implementation of supervisory control and data acquisition scada software applications that control pumps run based on demand and cost of energy 
in the aftermath of the attempt to deregulate the california energy market  energy costs still remain in flux  with resulting uncertainty in the company s ability to contain energy costs into the future 
fluctuations in customer demand for water due to seasonality  restrictions of use  weather and lifestyle can adversely affect operating results 
san jose water company operations are seasonal 
thus  results of operations for one quarter do not indicate results to be expected in next quarter 
rainfall and other weather conditions also affect the operations of san jose water company 
most water consumption occurs during the third quarter of each year when weather tends to be warm and dry 
in drought seasons  if customers are encouraged and required to conserve water due to a shortage of water supply or restriction of use  revenue tends to be lower 
similarly  in unusually wet seasons  water supply tends to be higher and customer demand tends to be lower  again resulting in lower revenues 
furthermore  certain lifestyle choices made by customers can affect demand for water 
for example  a significant portion of residential water use is for outside irrigation of lawns and landscaping 
if there is a decreased desire by customers to maintain landscaping for their homes  residential water demand could decrease  which may result in lower revenues 
a contamination event or other decline in source water quality could affect the water supply of san jose water company and therefore adversely affect the business and operating results 
san jose water company is subject to certain water quality risks relating to environmental regulations 
through water quality compliance programs  san jose water company continually monitors for contamination and pollution of its sources of water 
in the event of a contamination  san jose water company will likely have to procure water from more costly sources and increase future capital expenditures 
although the costs would likely be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that cpuc would approve a rate increase to recover the costs 
san jose water company is subject to litigation risks concerning water quality and contamination 
although san jose water company has not been and is not a party to any environmental and product related lawsuits  it believes such lawsuits against other water utilities have increased in frequency in recent years 
if san jose water company is subject to an environmental or product related lawsuit  it might incur significant legal costs and it is uncertain whether it would be able to recover the legal costs from ratepayers or other third parties 
in addition  if current california law regarding cpuc s preemptive jurisdiction over regulated public utilities for claims about compliance with department of health services dhs and environmental protection agency epa water quality standards changes  the legal exposure of san jose water company may be significantly increased 
changes of or more stringent environmental regulations could increase san jose water company s operating costs and affect its business 
san jose water company s operations are subject to water quality and pollution control regulations issued by the epa  the dhs and the california regional water quality control board 
it is also subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by other state and local regulatory agencies 
stringent environmental and water quality regulations could increase san jose water company s water quality compliance costs  hamper san jose water company s available water supplies  and increase future capital expenditure 
under the federal safe drinking water act sdwa  san jose water company is subject to regulation by the epa of the quality of water it sells and treatment techniques it uses to make the water potable 
the epa promulgates nationally applicable standards  including maximum contaminant levels mcls for drinking water 
san jose water company is currently in compliance with all of the primary mcls promulgated to date 
there can be no assurance that san jose water company will be able to continue to comply with all water quality requirements 
san jose water company has implemented monitoring activities and installed specific water treatment improvements enabling it to comply with existing mcls and plan for compliance with future drinking water regulations 
however  the epa and dhs have continuing authority to issue additional regulations under the sdwa 
it is possible that new or more stringent environmental standards could be imposed that will raise san jose water company s operating costs 
future drinking water regulations may require increased monitoring  additional treatment of underground water supplies  fluoridation of all supplies  more stringent performance standards for treatment plants and procedures to further reduce levels of disinfection byproducts 
san jose water company continues to seek to establish mechanisms for recovery of government mandated environmental compliance costs 
there are currently limited regulatory mechanisms and procedures available to the company for the recovery of such costs and there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered 
costs associated with security precautions may have an adverse effect on the operating results of san jose water company 
water utility companies have generally been on a heightened state of alert since the threats to the nation s health and security in the fall of san jose water company has taken steps to increase security at its water utility facilities and continues to implement a comprehensive security upgrade program for production and storage facilities  pump stations and company buildings 
san jose water company also coordinates security and planning information with scvwd  other bay area water utilities and various governmental and law enforcement agencies 
san jose water company is in the final stage of completing a system wide vulnerability assessment in compliance with federal regulations imposed on all water utilities 
this assessment is required to be completed by march  san jose water company has also actively participated in the security vulnerability assessment training offered by the american water works association research foundation and the epa 
san jose water company has and will continue to bear costs associated with additional security precautions to protect its water utility business and other operations 
while some of these costs are likely to be recovered in the form of higher rates  there can be no assurance that the cpuc will approve a rate increase to recover such costs  and as a result  the company s operating results and business may be adversely affected 
other factors that could adversely affect the operating results of sjw corp 
and its subsidiaries include the following the level of labor and non labor operating and maintenance expenses as affected by inflationary forces and collective bargaining power could adversely affect the operating and maintenance expenses of sjw corp 
the city of cupertino s lease operation could be adversely affected by capital requirements  the ability of san jose water company to raise rates through the cupertino city council  and the level of operating and maintenance expenses 
the wide acceptance of recycled water as substitute to potable water and the ability of san jose water company to retain its legal right to serve its customers recycled water would impact its sales  revenue and operating results 
sjw land company s expenses and operating results also could be adversely affected by the parking lot activities  the hp pavilion at san jose events  ongoing local  state and federal land use development activities and regulations  future economic conditions  and the development and fluctuations in the sale of the undeveloped properties 
other trends and development pension accruals increased  in primarily due to the decline in valuation of the retirement plan portfolio 
market conditions  not changes in operating risk or loss experience  was the sole reason for the average liability insurance cost increase of in after adjustments in self insured retentions 
medical  liability and pension expenses are expected to continue to have similar increases in nonregulated operations on october   sjw land company  a wholly owned subsidiary of sjw corp  entered into an agreement with the santa clara valley water district scvwd whereby sjw land company will sell to the scvwd the san tomas station  a nonutility property  at a contract price of  the transaction is expected to be completed in march the sale is expected to result in a gain of approximately  net of income tax expense of  which is to be included in the company will reinvest the proceeds in other commercial properties 
in january  sjw land company entered into an agreement for possession and use agreement with the valley transportation agency vta whereby sjw land company granted vta an irrevocable right to possession and use of acres of the company s parking lot property for the development of a light rail station 
vta has adopted a resolution authorizing a condemnation proceeding to acquire the land and has deposited million in an escrow account as fair market compensation 
sjw land company waived the right to challenge vta s possession and use in any subsequent eminent domain proceeding but reserved the right to assert  and has disputed  the fair market value placed on the land 
according to the terms of the agreement  if a settlement is not reached within three months of the execution of the agreement  vta can file an eminent domain complaint to acquire title to the parking lot property 
as of january   vta has not filed a complaint and sjw land company continues to negotiate in good faith with vta over the fair market value 
this transaction will be recognized and is expected to result in an increase to net income  if and when the compensation issue is settled or a final court order is rendered
