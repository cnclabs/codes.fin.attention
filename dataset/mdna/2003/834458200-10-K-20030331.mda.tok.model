item business the markets we serve wireless  wireline and data services are provided by nearly  network operators around the world 
during the period of rapid growth from these network operators purchased trillions of dollars of new equipment 
much of that investment was never deployed or has never been fully utilized 
since there has been very little capital available to network operators to complete the projects already planned or to upgrade their networks to accommodate changing customer requirements 
continually increasing downward pressure on capital spending and operating budgets have encouraged network operators to rely upon the large supply of previously purchased equipment to satisfy their network s hardware requirements 
using previously purchased equipment avoids additional spending and improves key financial metrics cash flow  return on assets  etc 
but  there is often a mis match between the excess equipment that they already own and the specific hardware that their network needs today 
this overhang of excess equipment has driven further reductions in new equipment purchased 
manufacturers have responded by slashing prices to dispose of their excess inventories and reducing their work forces to lower their break even points and return to profitability 
as a result there is a large overhang of recent vintage hardware  a mis match within each network of equipment they already own vs 
equipment they need today and a lack of technical personnel available to put the right equipment in the right place in the right network 
the somera solution we provide telecommunications operators with equipment deployment services to support their need to optimize their networks and equipment assets more efficiently and cost effectively 
our equipment deployment services are categorized into three primary areas 
first  working with the operator to determine the feasibility of redeploying existing equipment within their own network or valuing that same equipment for possible re marketing to another operators network 
second  supplying operators with the optimum combination of new and redeployed equipment based on their implementation strategy  budget and time to market requirements 
finally  providing value added services to supplement or replace resources to execute programs and projects that our customers traditionally managed themselves 
somera is uniquely qualified to address this market need by understanding the complexities of equipment deployment  whether that be a function of operators redeploying equipment assets within their own network intra network deployment or disposing of assets outside of their network inter network deployment for redeployment into another operators network 
by working with somera  operators can make multi vendor equipment purchase  equipment disposition  and service decisions  from a single cost effective source 
a key differentiator for somera is the application of our intellectual capital in data  people  and operations  which we believe enables executional excellence and provides a distinct competitive advantage 
our proprietary global database of customers and networks enable us to value  find  redeploy and dispose of equipment assets at the greatest return to our customers 
the experience and skills of our people deliver unbiased solutions to our customers problems 
our equipment deployment services competencies are supported by our world class operations  certified expertise  and program management skills 
equipment deployment services equipment placement valuation we help our customers determine the market value of idle and sub optimized equipment assets 
the financial potential from these assets may provide a source of capital to offset the expense of other equipment and services purchases 
as part of the evaluation  we assess the viability of redeploying this equipment within the operator s own network intra network deployment or outside of the operator s network inter network deployment 
the metrics for valuation are based on the data that we capture in our proprietary global database 
the database consists of product information and its respective market value  the installed technology base within our customers networks  network build out and de installation plans  and demand and supply of equipment on the secondary market 
the data domiciled within our database and applied to the valuation and marketability process is captured primarily through our sales and purchase transactions and interactions with customers 
the data is interpreted by our internal sales  procurement  and supply organization 
we help our customers place equipment and maximize the value of idle or sub optimized equipment while minimizing their expense and management attention to the process 
we offer four types of equipment placement programs 
after collaborative investigation with the customer  we execute one  or a combination  based on the type of equipment the customer wants to dispose of  the current market demand for the equipment  the viability and condition of the equipment  and the customer s network deployment strategy 
our four types of equipment placement programs are as follows consignment  asset exchange  direct purchase and equipment disposal 
consignment 
our consignment program is designed to reduce the customer s excess inventory levels while maximizing recovery return based on market value 
in the consignment program  we do not take title to the equipment  but rather the customer owns and typically stores the excess inventory in our warehouse 
our sales force then promotes the sale of the consigned equipment into our network of customers and prospects 
net proceeds from the consigned sales are shared between the customer and us based on negotiated terms 
asset exchange 
our asset exchange program is designed to help customers maximize their capital budget by substituting  or exchanging  equipment from the customer s existing inventory for equipment that the customer wants to purchase 
the equipment desired by the customer is supplied from our own inventory  from virtual inventory identified from the proprietary global database or from inventory to which we contractually have access 
exchange deals are typically executed for high demand infrastructure equipment 
direct purchase 
our direct purchase program involves our directly purchasing equipment from the operator either through direct payment or credit for future purchases 
direct purchase deals are typically executed for equipment where we have an existing order of that equipment pending in the system 
equipment disposal 
some equipment is no longer marketable and should be disposed of or scrapped 
we can provide support to customers to manage the disposition of this equipment in a manner that complies with environmental regulations 
equipment supply we are focused on accelerating the return on investment of equipment purchased by our customers 
we are a vendor neutral source for telecommunications carriers equipment needs 
we offer our customers multiple categories of telecommunications infrastructure equipment to address their specific and changing equipment requirements primarily for network maintenance and incremental build outs 
we support analog  t  t  sonet  tdma  cdma  and gsm for voice and data communications 
the equipment we sell includes new and redeployed items from a variety of manufacturers 
in  we had a database of over  different items  from over different manufacturers 
we offer the original manufacturer s warranty on all new equipment 
on redeployed equipment  we offer our own warranty which guarantees that the equipment will perform up to the manufacturer s original specifications 
the new equipment we offer consists of telecommunications equipment purchased primarily from the original equipment manufacturers oem directly or distributors 
the redeployed equipment we offer consists primarily of equipment removed from the existing telecommunications networks of telecommunications operators  many of whom are also our customers  and equipment purchased from resellers 
our sources for redeployed equipment are typically the original owners of such equipment and either the operator  another third party  or a somera trained professional removes the equipment from the network on behalf of the operator 
substantially all of our equipment sourcing activities are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
although we seek  as part of our asset management strategy to establish strategic contract relationships with operators  we anticipate that operating results for any given period will continue to be dependent  to a significant extent  on purchase order based transactions 
the equipment we sell is grouped into several general product categories and includes core  edge  and ancillary infrastructure support 
switching 
switching equipment is used by operators to manage call traffic and to deliver value added services 
switches and related equipment are located in the central office of a telecommunications operator and serve to determine pathways and circuits for establishing  breaking or completing voice and data communications over the public switched telephone network pstn 
we provide a variety of switching equipment  including switches  circuit cards  shelves  racks and other ancillary items in support of carrier upgrades and reconfigurations 
manufacturers of switching equipment whose products we sell include alcatel usa  lucent technologies and nortel networks 
transmission

we sell a broad range of power equipment  including power bays  rectifiers  batteries  breaker panels and converters 
manufacturers of power equipment whose products we sell include argus  lucent technologies  marconi and nortel networks 
as part of the equipment supply offering  we will support customers access to critical maintenance spares to minimize network downtime and potential revenue loss 
under this program  we stock new and redeployed equipment and co locate the inventory at the customers facilities or in locations in close geographic proximity to the customers network operations for immediate access 
services resource allocation has become a more critical concern among operators in the execution of their network deployment strategy 
resources once focused on asset management and network re deployment are now being redirected to core operator business strategies to generate revenue and implement new services 
in response to this market trend  we have expanded and enhanced our services strategy to include planning  deployment  engineering  and logistics and materials management services 
our ability to deliver a combined equipment and services solution  which supplements or replaces services that our customers traditionally performed themselves  can enable operators to reduce operating expenses and focus on growth strategies 
services revenue has not been material to date  but is becoming a growing part of the company s business with revenues generated primarily from north american operators 
in  we advanced this strategy and strengthened our competencies through the purchase of certain assets of compass telecom  llc  a provider of outsourced services 
additionally  all work is performed to iso certification standards 
we provide the following services in connection with our equipment supply o planning services our strategy is to support our customers need to execute their network plans in a manner that will maximize the impact to their business 
our planning services are designed to support this objective  which include business case analysis  value engineering  and assessing valuing existing equipment and determining optimal use or disposition of identified excess assets 
o network deployment services we provide customers with deployment services for network build outs and existing network modifications 
deployment support is defined as program management  site acquisition  site development  construction management  and installation 
program management we provide a full spectrum of program management support 
our qualified program managers oversee many of the assignments that have traditionally been managed by the operator s own personnel 
site acquisition  development  and construction management we support the site and construction requirements for new and existing network developments 
this includes strategic site planning and mapping  leasing  documentation  zoning  regulatory compliance  process engineering  and design and construction 
installation de installation installation de installation support has become increasingly important to our customers 
the complexity of today s networks makes it difficult for any one manufacturer to support the multi product  multi platform network installation de installation process 
we work with our customers to define the appropriate level of certified engineering resources required to complete a project 
trained technicians are dispatched to the location  where removal of the equipment is performed 
our broad based technical expertise in over different technologies and platforms enables us to support this need 
typically  the equipment de installed from the site is shipped to our distribution and operations center for refurbishment and reconfiguration 
o engineering services we provide our customers with turnkey solutions for end to end program execution 
our program offering is defined based on existing or emergency opportunities 
our engineering services support fixed network  wireless backhaul  site design  structural analysis  e  and das strategies 
o logistic materials management services we provide customers with repair refurbishment spares management  customization  equipment disposal  testing  and kitting staging services 
testing  repair refurbishment to ensure the reliability of redeployed equipment we sell  many of our products are subjected to a rigorous testing and evaluation process 
the process includes loop back testing  field simulation testing  and self diagnostics 
we also perform repair services for customer owned equipment 
refurbishment is completed to manufacturer specifications and customer input 
spares management availability of critical maintenance spares is essential to managing and minimizing network downtime 
we work with our customers to develop a spares program to ensure critical spares availability based on historical utilization rates and other data 
material will either be co located at our customers facilities or in close geographic proximity to the deployment site 
customization we offer customized assembly of multi vendor equipment  tailored to the network s specific configuration 
in support of this process  somera may provide customers with ancillary equipment and components to complete the project and staged deployment based on the network implementation schedule 
equipment disposal somera works with customers to identify what equipment is no longer marketable or deployable and should be disposed or scrapped 
we then manage our customer s disposition needs in a manner that complies with environmental regulations and maximizes the customer s return on such equipment 
we execute our services strategy through a combination of internal expertise and strategic partnerships 
services performed by us either at the customers site or at one of our facilities in california  georgia  new jersey or texas 
we have announced plans to consolidate these facilities to a new central operation in texas by the third quarter of services performed for the europe  middle east  and africa emea region are managed out of amsterdam  the netherlands 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to be in close geographic proximity to our customers 
the united states sales organization is located at both our corporate headquarters in santa barbara  california and at strategic locations in california  illinois  new jersey  texas  and georgia 
the latin america region is supported primarily from florida with operations in mexico and brazil 
operations for the emea region are headquartered in amsterdam  the netherlands with agent or sales offices in countries throughout the region including the united kingdom  sweden and russia 
operations for asia pacific are conducted by our offices located in singapore and hong kong 
as of december   we employed over sales  services and procurement professionals 
we generate sales leads primarily through direct sales contact  telemarketing  customer referrals and various marketing outreach programs 
in the u 
s  our sales force is organized by market segment  including specialized teams focused on the regional bell operating companies rbocs  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs  long distance carriers ixcs  competitive local exchange carriers clecs  national wireless carriers  including cellular  personal communications service companies pcss  and rural wireless carriers 
within these segments  our sales force operates on a defined strategic account basis with sales operatives in geographic proximity to our customers 
within each segment  we employ dedicated teams with extensive market knowledge to meet the specific requirements of these customers 
for our customers in other countries  we approach the business on a geographic basis  rather than a defined account basis  due to language  cultural  and country specific considerations 
another key feature of our selling effort is the relationships we establish at various levels in our customers organizations 
this structure allows us to establish multiple contacts with each customer across their management  engineering and purchasing operations 
an integral part of our asset management strategy is establishing more senior level relationships 
we believe this is important to the company s future as the industry consolidates  buying decisions become centralized  and relationships become established by overarching or master agreements 
we have account teams focused on each of the large national telecommunications operators and dedicated sales support teams for others 
an account team comprises equipment sales  procurement  services and logistic responsibilities 
this level of integration enables us to respond more rapidly to customer requirements and provides consistent high quality customer service  which builds long term relationships with our customers 
sales teams are further supported by product line managers responsible for matching supply with demand to assure equipment availability and monitoring the category to identify emerging trends that might impact our customers 
each team member has access to  and is supported by  our proprietary global database 
this real time proprietary information system allows each team to o respond to customer requirements by accessing our database of excess and redeployed equipment located at operators  manufacturers  distributors and other third parties worldwide  as well as by accessing our select inventory  o identify cross selling opportunities for equipment and services  o access relevant detailed purchase and sale information  o access technical and system configuration information  o trace and track all customer and vendor order activity  and o project and anticipate customer network deployment requirements and sales opportunities 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the procurement and testing of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
although our asset management strategy seeks to establish strategic contractual relationships with operators  we anticipate that operating results for any given period will continue to be dependent  to a significant extent  on purchase orders 
these purchase orders often can be modified  delayed or canceled by our customers without penalty 
additionally  as telecommunications equipment supplier competition increases  we may need to lower our selling prices or pay more for the equipment we procure 
consequently  our gross margins may decrease over time 
we recognize revenue  net of estimated provision for sales returns and warranty obligations  when we ship equipment to our customers  provided that there are no significant post delivery obligations 
as we attempt to expand our sales  marketing and procurement efforts into international markets  we face a number of challenges  including o recruiting skilled sales and technical support personnel  o creation of new supply and customer relationships  o difficulties and costs of managing and staffing international operations  and o developing relationships with local suppliers 
any of these factors could potentially harm our future international operations 
our marketing efforts are focused on defining the category and enhancing our brand therein 
activities to support this strategy include public relations  advertising in key telecommunications industry publications  e marketing  cooperative marketing  industry trade shows  professional sales presentations and brochures  and customer events 
we believe the size and scope of our operations in our highly fragmented industry gives us both a unique advantage and opportunity to further build and enhance our brand recognition 
customers we sell to every major segment of the telecommunications sector 
we sell equipment to ilecs  rbocs  ixcs  wireless operators including cellular  pcs  paging and smrs  and clecs 
we have a healthy account diversity with over  customers worldwide with the majority located in the united states 
in  verizon communications accounted for of our net revenue  with no other customers accounting for more than of our net revenue 
in and  verizon communications accounted for and  respectively  of our net revenue 
no other customers accounted for greater than of our net revenue in and sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and of our net revenue in customers from whom we recognized at least million in net revenue in include leading operators such as verizon communications  at t  bellsouth  cingular  lucent technologies  triton and united states cellular 
competition the market for asset management  equipment and services  is highly competitive 
constrained capital budgets  the over abundance of telecommunications infrastructure equipment on the market  and continued pressures to improve balance sheet metrics among operators and manufacturers will further intensify competition in our industry for the foreseeable future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  lower gross margins and loss of our market share in the future 
as we expand our services strategy  we are likely to face a new set of competitors 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition  and a larger base of customers 
these factors are likely to give these competitors a substantial competitive advantage 
increased competition in the secondary equipment market from distributors and other secondary market dealers for redeployed telecommunications equipment could also heighten demand for the limited supply of redeployed equipment  which would lead to increased prices for  and reduce the availability of  this equipment 
any increase in these prices could significantly impact our ability to maintain our gross margins 
any reduction in the availability of this equipment could cause us to be able to meet customer demand 
also on the equipment front  we currently face competition directly from oems who may aggressively discount or extend terms to gain share  reduce inventories  and meet quarterly financial expectations 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater resources and name recognition  and a larger base of customers 
these competitors are also likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages over us  including the following o ability to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their equipment and related services  o ability to adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can  o ability to expand existing customer relationships and more effectively develop new customer relationships than we can  including securing long term purchase agreements  o ability to leverage their customer relationships through volume purchasing contracts  and other means intended to discourage customers from purchasing products from us  o ability to more rapidly adopt new or emerging technologies and increase the array of products offered to better respond to changes in customer requirements  o greater focus and expertise on specific manufacturers or product lines  and o ability to form new alliances or business combinations to rapidly acquire significant market share 
there can be no assurance that we will have the resources to compete successfully in the future or that competitive pressures will not harm our business 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory 
we have never had a work stoppage  and none of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  integrate  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key sales personnel 
demand for qualified personnel in the telecommunications equipment industry and our primary geographic locations is competitive 
we may not be successful in attracting  integrating  retaining and motivating a sufficient number of qualified employees to conduct our business in the future

net revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net revenue was primarily driven by a decrease in new equipment sales  partly offset by a increase in redeployed equipment sales 
net revenues from customers in the united states decreased to million from million  primarily due to reduced new equipment sales 
net revenues from customers outside of the united states increased to million in from million in due to the expansion of our international operations  primarily in europe  asia and latin america and our increased focus on international sales 
net revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease in net revenue attributable to new equipment sales was due primarily to the financial distress of the telecommunications industry  which has reduced customers demand for new equipment 
in addition  telecommunications operators capital spending budgets continue to be reduced and we see increased pricing pressure caused by oems reduction of their equipment prices 
net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due to greater demand among our customers in connection with the build out and servicing of their existing networks 
we also see an increased preference expressed by our customers for redeployed equipment as a cost effective alternative to new equipment 
we believe net revenue attributable to new and redeployed equipment will continue to vary from quarter to quarter as customers demand for such equipment fluctuates 
we believe net revenue from customers in the united states will decrease but that net revenues from customers outside of the united states will increase in both absolute dollars and as a percentage of overall net income as we continue to expand our international operations 
service revenue was not material at of total revenues in and given that such services are sold in conjunction with equipment sales  we have included it with equipment 
cost of net revenue 
substantially all of our cost of net revenue consists of the costs of the equipment we purchase from third party sources 
cost of net revenue decreased to million in from million in the decrease in cost of net revenue during this period is primarily attributable to decreases in our net revenues of new equipment sales  offset by an million increase to our inventory reserve in the fourth quarter the increase in inventory reserve resulted from continued weakness in the telecommunications industry and changes in our business strategy 
cost of net revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower volumes of new equipment sales  offset by an increase in the inventory reserve during the fourth quarter of million relating to obsolete  but new equipment 
cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment was due primarily to a million increase in inventory reserve in the fourth quarter related to redeployed equipment  increased volume of redeployed equipment sales and an increase in the cost to acquire redeployed equipment 
we believe that the cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment will continue to fluctuate in absolute dollar terms as our volume of redeployed equipment sales fluctuates in response to customer demand 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an million increase to our inventory reserve we made in fourth quarter we anticipate increased pricing pressure on new and redeployed equipment due to oems reduction of their equipment prices during the fourth quarter as a result of the slow down of the economy in and gross margin attributable to new equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales was primarily due to an increase in the inventory reserve of million during the fourth quarter  which related to new equipment and increased pricing pressures 
gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due primarily to an increase in the inventory reserve of million during the fourth quarter related to redeployed equipment and increased price pressure on redeployed equipment 
we believe that gross margins attributable to redeployed equipment sales may continue to fluctuate depending upon the mix of redeployed equipment we sell  our ability to procure inventory at favorable prices  and the pace of recovery of the economy in general and the telecommunications industry in particular 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and benefits for sales  marketing and procurement employees as well as costs associated with advertising  promotions and our e commerce initiative 
our e commerce initiative was terminated during the fourth quarter of a majority of our sales and marketing expenses are incurred in connection with establishing and maintaining long term relationships with a variety of operators 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in salaries and wages associated with the hiring of additional sales and procurement personnel  an increase of million in travel related costs associated with our intensified sales efforts  and an increase of  in marketing primarily associated with a market study on the redeployed telecommunications space  partially offset by a decrease of  in lower absolute commissions corresponding to lower gross profit on which commissions are based 
the absolute dollar increase in salaries and wages and decrease in commissions were also due to a change in compensation structure for our senior sales personnel  wherein base salaries were increased and commission rates were reduced as well as severance packages paid to employees who were terminated as part of a reduction in workforce we completed in the third quarter of we expect that our sales and marketing expenses will decrease in as a result of our restructuring in the fourth quarter of general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salary and benefit costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees and facility costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was due primarily to an increase of  in relocation costs  an increase of  associated with facilities costs and an increase of million in depreciation 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease due to our cost saving measures 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
in the fourth quarter of  the company announced and began implementation of its operational restructuring plan to reduce operating costs and streamline its operating facilities 
this initiative involved the reduction of employee staff by positions throughout the company in managerial  professional  clerical and operational roles and consolidation of the oxnard  norcross and euless distribution and repair facilities to one centralized location in dallas 
for the year ended december   the charges associated with the restructuring were as follows in thousands total charge restructuring charge continuing lease obligations termination benefits  total restructuring charge  asset impairments  total charge  continuing lease obligations primarily relate to closure of the oxnard  norcross  and euless facilities 
amounts expensed represent estimates of undiscounted future cash outflows  offset by anticipated third party sub lease rentals 
at december   the company remains obligated under lease obligations of million associated with its december operational restructuring  offset by estimates of future sub lease rentals of  the lease obligations expire in the company expects cash savings of  a quarter beginning in the third quarter of and thereafter 
termination benefits are comprised of severance related payments for all employees to be terminated in connection with the operational restructuring 
termination benefits do not include any amounts for employment related services prior to termination 
other restructuring costs include broker commissions  professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses directly attributable to the restructuring 
at december   the accrued liability associated with the restructuring charge was million and consisted of the following in thousands restructuring balance at charge payments december  lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income termination benefits   total   as of december   employees had been terminated  and actual termination benefits paid were  asset impairments primarily relate to e commerce software the company invested in  in anticipation of on line sales 
the online market did not materialize and in the fourth quarter of  the company eliminated the department and wrote off the assets 
the company expects million in amortization savings in and none thereafter 
restructuring charges in relate to a reorganization in which the domestic workforce was reduced by people  or approximately of the then existing workforce 
the total charges associated with the reorganization were  and represented accrued salaries and wages  severance  accrued vacation  payroll taxes and other directly related costs  all which were paid in amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of customer contracts  non compete covenants and goodwill related to our acquisitions during  and which were amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from million in the decline in amortization of intangible assets relates to our adoption of sfas no 
business combinations and goodwill and other intangibles  which requires that workforce intangibles be subsumed into goodwill and that goodwill no longer be amortized 
this resulted in a million decrease in amortization in this is partially offset by additional intangible asset amortization of  resulting from the compass acquisition completed in october  we expect amortization to increase slightly during to reflect a full year amortization of intangible assets relating to the compass acquisition 
interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net consists of investment earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income  net decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates in effect during and a declining cash balance from january to december we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  income tax provision benefit 
in we had an income tax benefit of million  with an effective tax rate of 
in  we had a tax provision of million with an effective tax rate of 
our tax rate decrease is due primarily to goodwill no longer being amortized as a result of sfas and and tax efficiencies gained as an indirect consequence of internally restructuring domestic business operations 
compared to net revenue 
net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue was primarily attributable to a general increase in our equipment and services offerings rather than significant increases in the price of the products we sold  expansion of our international operations  and growth in significant customer accounts 
net revenues from customers outside of the united states increased to million in from million in due to the expansion of our international operations 
our acquisitions of msi in october and the equipment repair business of asurent in october contributed to the general increase in equipment and service offerings 
these increases were partially offset by the effects of the general slow down in the telecommunications operators capital spending levels  including increased price pressure on our redeployed equipment prices  caused by oems reduction of their equipment prices 
net revenue attributable to new equipment sales increased slightly to million in from million in net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due to greater demand among our customers in connection with the build out and servicing of their existing networks 
we believe net revenue attributable to new and redeployed equipment will increase as our customers continue to build their existing networks 
cost of net revenue 
cost of net revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue during this period is primarily attributable to increases in our volume of redeployed equipment sales 
cost of net revenue attributable to new equipment sales decreased slightly to million in from million in cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment sales increased to million in from million in the increase in cost of net revenue attributable to redeployed equipment was due primarily to increased volume of redeployed equipment sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenue  or gross margin  decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to increased price pressure on redeployed equipment due to oems reduction of their equipment prices  as a result of the slow down of the economy in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales increased to in from in the increase in gross margin attributable to new equipment sales was primarily a function of equipment mix 
we believe gross margin attributable to new equipment sales will continue to fluctuate depending upon the mix of the new equipment we sell 
gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin attributable to redeployed equipment sales was due primarily to increased price pressure on redeployed equipment 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was primarily due to an increase of million in salaries and wages associated with the hiring of additional sales and procurement personnel  and an increase of  in travel related costs associated with our intensified sales efforts  partially offset by a decrease of million in lower absolute commissions corresponding to lower gross profit on which commissions are based 
the absolute increase in salaries and wages and decrease in commissions were also due to a change in compensation structure for our senior sales personnel  wherein base salaries were increased and commission rates were reduced 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of net revenue  in from million  or of net revenue  in this increase was due primarily to an increase of million in compensation costs and benefits associated with the increase in employees relating to the expansion of our operations  an increase of million associated with facilities costs and an increase of million in depreciation 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation was  and  for and  respectively 
stock based compensation includes stock based charges resulting from variable accounting treatment of certain stock options issued to key directors 
the number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding vested and unvested employee stock awards was approximately million and million  or and of our outstanding common stock  at december  and  respectively 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of acquired workforce  customer contract and goodwill related to our acquisitions during and which were amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from  in this increase in reflected a full year of amortization of the goodwill and purchased intangibles arising from the msi acquisition compared with three months of amortization in restructuring charges 
on march   in light of the economic environment and the state of the telecommunications industry  we undertook a reorganization in which the domestic workforce was reduced by people  or approximately of the then existing workforce 
the terminations were not concentrated in any particular aspect of the business 
we recorded total associated charges of  representing accrued salaries and wages  severance  accrued vacation  payroll taxes and other directly related costs  all of which were paid during interest income expense  net 
interest income expense  net consists of investment earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income  net decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in effect during we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  income tax provision 
income tax provision decreased to million in  an effective tax rate of  from million in  an effective tax rate of

liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents balance was and million at december  and  respectively 
we finance our operations primarily through cash flows from operations 
net cash generated by operating activities in was million 
the primary increase in net cash provided by operating activities was a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
we saw over a million dollar decline in net revenues in the fourth quarter 
decreasing revenues and continued focus on cash collection caused the balance to decrease significantly over the prior year 
the inventory provision increased by million  primarily due to a million increase in the inventory reserve taken in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter we experienced a significant decline in market demand over the previous quarter and continued to see increased pricing pressures 
historically  the value of inventory increased as it aged and became scarce in the market 
in addition  when the decision was made to consolidate operations in dallas  we recognized the cost of transporting some of the items exceeded the market price 
at the time we made the decision to consolidate our distribution facilities in dallas  we reviewed inventory for impairment and concluded that a write down of million was necessary 
increases in our operating activities were offset by a million decrease in accounts payable  million increase in inventories and a million decrease in income taxes payable 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
the primary increases in operating activities comprised of net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  a million increase in inventory reserve  an increase in accounts payable of million  increase in deferred revenue of million and increase in income taxes payable of million 
the increases in operating activities were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million 
net cash used in operating activities in was million 
the primary increase in operating activities was net income of million 
net income was offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventories of million 
net cash used in investing activities in comprised primarily our acquisition of compass for million in cash including acquisition costs  acquisition of property and equipment of million and a loan to an officer for million 
net cash used in investing activities in comprised primarily our acquisition of asurent for million in cash  including acquisition costs  and acquisition of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities in comprised primarily of our acquisition of msi for million in cash  including acquisition costs and acquisition of property and equipment of million 
cash flows from financing activities for the years ended december  and  included proceeds from employee stock purchases of  and  respectively 
cash flow used in financing activity for the year ended december  was million  which primarily relates to a repayment of a line of credit for million and a repayment of capital leases of  at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we do not currently plan to pay dividends  but rather to retain earnings for use in the operation of our business and to fund future growth 
we had no long term debt outstanding as of december  the following summarizes our contractual obligations under various operating leases for both office and warehouse space as at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
the remaining lease terms range in length from one to four years with future minimum lease payments  net of sublease proceeds of  in  as follows in thousands thereafter restructuring related leases see note operating leases      total commitments      we have not included contingent earn out payments in the table above 
the potential earn out payments to the former owners of compass is million during and million in if the earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization exceed million in and million in we are also exposed to credit risk in the event of default of the sub lessee of certain facilities  because we are still liable to meet our obligations under the terms of the original lease agreement 
we anticipate fluctuations in working capital in the future primarily as a result of fluctuations in sales of equipment and relative levels of inventory 
we will also continue to expend significant amounts of capital on property and equipment related to the restructuring of our corporate headquarters  consolidation of our distribution centers  equipment testing infrastructure  and additional facilities to support our growth  as well as expending significant resources in support of our information technology projects 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  valuation allowances  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes to be critical policies 
revenue recognition 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of new and redeployed telecommunications equipment 
with the exception of exchange transactions  revenue is recognized upon our delivery of equipment provided that  at the time of delivery  there is evidence of a contractual arrangement with the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and there are no significant remaining obligations 
delivery occurs when title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  generally at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we also generate services revenue in connection with equipment sales 
revenue for transactions that include multiple elements such as equipment and services is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognized when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the following criteria are satisfied undelivered elements are not essential to the functionality of delivered elements  uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved  and the fair value for all undelivered elements is known 
for revenue from services represented approximately of net revenue 
services represented less than of net revenues prior to revenue is deferred when customer acceptance is uncertain  when significant obligations remain  or when undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered products 
a reserve for sales returns and warranty obligations is recorded at the time of shipment and is based on our historical experience 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
at december   the reserve for sales returns and warranty obligations was  we supply equipment to companies in exchange for redeployed equipment or to companies from which redeployed equipment was purchased under separate arrangements executed within a short period of time reciprocal arrangements 
for reciprocal arrangements  the company considers accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 nonmonetary transactions magnitude of boot and exceptions to the use of fair value  interpretation of apb no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions 
revenue is recognized when the equipment received in accordance with the reciprocal arrangement is sold through to a third party 
revenues recognized under reciprocal arrangements were million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no revenues recognized under reciprocal arrangements during valuation allowances 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  we make estimates of doubtful accounts and slow moving and obsolete inventory 
these estimates are made based on a consideration of various factors  including historical experience  knowledge of customers and the telecommunications equipment market  and current economic trends 
actual results could differ from those estimates  which could affect our operating results 
at december   the estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory was million 
during the year ended december  we recorded a million increase to the inventory reserve  resulting from continued weakness in the telecommunications industry and changes in our business strategy 
at december   the estimate for doubtful accounts was  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
the cost of acquired companies is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
costs allocated to identifiable intangible assets are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated useful lives of the assets  as determined by underlying contract terms or appraisals 
such lives range from fifteen months to three years 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment tests during june or more frequently based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying value 
events or circumstances that might require the need for more frequent tests include  but are not limited to the loss of a number of significant clients  the identification of other impaired assets within the company  the disposition of a significant portion of the company  or a significant adverse change in business climate or regulations 
accordingly  as a result of the restructuring activities and inventory write downs  the company conducted a second impairment test at december  the estimated fair value of the company exceeded the carrying value in both tests conducted in  indicating the underlying goodwill was not impaired at the respective testing dates 
the goodwill balances at december  and were million and million  respectively 
deferred taxes 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assess the need for additional valuation allowances related to our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had no valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
will apply to exit or disposal activities initiated after fiscal year the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
the effect on adoption of sfas no 
will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the disclosure provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and have been incorporated into these financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  addressing how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of undelivered items  and delivery of any undelivered item is probable 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent on the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
the final consensus is applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
we are currently assessing the impact of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have not assessed the impact of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business could be harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
you should also refer to other information contained in this annual report on form k  including our financial statements and related notes 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate in future periods  which might lead to reduced prices for our stock 
our annual or quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our annual or quarterly operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the trading price of our stock could significantly decline 
factors that could impact our operating results include o the rate  timing and volume of orders for the telecommunications infrastructure equipment we sell  o the rate at which telecommunications operators de install their equipment  o decreases in our selling prices due to competition in the secondary market or price pressure from oems  o our ability to obtain products cost effectively from oems  distributors  operators and other secondary sources of telecommunications equipment  o our ability to provide equipment and service offerings on a timely basis to satisfy customer demand  o variations in customer capital spending patterns due to seasonality  economic conditions for telecommunications operators and other factors  o write offs due to inventory defects or obsolescence  o the sales cycle for equipment we sell  which can be relatively lengthy  o delays in the commencement of our operations in new market segments and geographic regions  and o costs relating to possible acquisitions and integration of new businesses 
our business depends upon our ability to match third party redeployed equipment supply with carrier demand for this equipment and failure to do so could reduce our net revenue 
our success depends on our continued ability to match the equipment needs of telecommunications operators with the supply of redeployed equipment available in the secondary market 
we depend upon maintaining business relationships with third parties who can provide us with redeployed equipment and information on available redeployed equipment 
failure to effectively manage these relationships and match the needs of our customers with available supply of redeployed equipment could damage our ability to generate net revenue 
in the event operators decrease the rate at which they de install their networks  or choose not to de install their networks at all  it would be more difficult for us to locate this equipment  which could negatively impact our net revenue 
a continued downturn in the telecommunications industry or an industry trend toward reducing or delaying additional equipment purchases due to cost cutting pressures could reduce demand for our products 
we rely significantly upon customers concentrated in the telecommunications industry as a source of net revenue and redeployed equipment inventory 
in  we experienced a general downturn in the level of capital spending by our telecommunications customers 
this slow down in capital spending could result in postponement of network upgrades and reduced sales to our customers 
there can be no assurance that the level of capital spending in the telecommunications industry or by our customers specifically will increase or remain at current levels 
the market for supplying equipment to telecommunications operators is competitive  and if we cannot compete effectively  our net revenue and gross margins might decline 
competition among companies who supply equipment to telecommunications operators is intense 
we currently face competition primarily from three sources oems  distributors and secondary market dealers who sell new and redeployed telecommunications infrastructure equipment 
if we are unable to compete effectively against our current or future competitors  we may have to lower our selling prices and may experience reduced gross margins and loss of market share  either of which could harm our business 
competition is likely to increase as new companies enter this market  as current competitors expand their products and services or as our competitors consolidate 
increased competition in the secondary market for telecommunications equipment could also heighten demand for the limited supply of redeployed equipment which would lead to increased prices for  and reduce the availability of  this equipment 
any increase in these prices could significantly impact our ability to maintain our gross margins 
we do not have many formal relationships with suppliers of telecommunications equipment and may not have access to adequate product supply 
in fiscal year  of our net revenue was generated from the sale of redeployed telecommunications equipment 
typically  we do not have supply contracts to obtain this equipment and are dependent on the de installation of equipment by operators to provide us with much of the equipment we sell 
our ability to buy redeployed equipment from operators is dependent on our relationships with them 
if we fail to develop and maintain these business relationships with operators or they are unwilling to sell redeployed equipment to us  our ability to sell redeployed equipment will suffer 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of one or more of our key customers would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
historically  a significant portion of our sales have been to relatively few customers 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and in verizon communications accounted for  and of our net revenue in  and  respectively 
in addition  substantially all of our sales are made on a purchase order basis  and no customer has entered into a long term purchasing agreement with us 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our current customers will continue to purchase from us 
the loss of  or any reduction in orders from  a significant customer would have a negative impact on our net revenue 
we may be forced to reduce the sales prices for the equipment we sell  which may impair our ability to maintain our gross margins 
in the future we expect to reduce prices in response to competition and to generate increased sales volume 
in some manufacturers reduced their prices of new telecommunications equipment 
if manufacturers reduce the prices of new telecommunications equipment  we may be required to further reduce the price of the new and redeployed equipment we sell 
if we are forced to reduce our prices or are unable to shift the sales mix towards higher margin equipment sales  we will not be able to maintain current gross margins 
the market for redeployed telecommunications equipment is relatively new and it is unclear whether our equipment and service offerings and our business will achieve long term market acceptance 
the market for redeployed telecommunications equipment is relatively new and evolving  and we are not certain that our potential customers will adopt and deploy redeployed telecommunications equipment in their networks 
for example  with respect to redeployed equipment that includes a significant software component  potential customers may be unable to obtain a license or sublicense for the software 
even if they do purchase redeployed equipment  our potential customers may not choose to purchase redeployed equipment from us for a variety of reasons 
our customers may also re deploy their displaced equipment within their own networks which would eliminate their need for our equipment and service offerings 
these internal solutions would also limit the supply of redeployed equipment available for us to purchase  which would limit the development of this market 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and sales personnel  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees 
the loss of key members of our senior management or other key employees could negatively impact our operating results and our ability to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we depend on our sales professionals to serve customers in each of our markets 
the loss of key sales professionals could significantly disrupt our relationships with our customers 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
competition for employees in the telecommunications equipment industry is intense 
additionally  we depend on our ability to train and develop skilled sales people and an inability to do so would significantly harm our growth prospects and operating performance 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing market 
the market for the equipment and services we sell is characterized by technological changes  evolving industry standards  changing customer needs and frequent new equipment and service introductions 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend  in part  on our ability to timely and cost effectively o respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes  o develop our internal technical capabilities and expertise  o broaden our equipment and service offerings  and o adapt our services to new technologies as they emerge 
our failure in any of these areas could harm our business 
moreover  any increased emphasis on software solutions as opposed to equipment solutions could limit the availability of redeployed equipment  decrease customer demand for the equipment we sell  or cause the equipment we sell to become obsolete 
the lifecycles of telecommunications infrastructure equipment may become shorter  which would decrease the supply of  and carrier demand for  redeployed equipment 
our sales of redeployed equipment depend upon telecommunications operator utilization of existing telecommunications network technology 
if the lifecycle of equipment comprising operator networks is significantly shortened for any reason  including technology advancements  the installed base of any particular model would be limited 
this limited installed base would reduce the supply of  and demand for  redeployed equipment which could decrease our net revenue 
many of our customers are telecommunications operators that may at any time reduce or discontinue their purchases of the equipment we sell to them 
if our customers choose to defer or curtail their capital spending programs  it could have a negative impact on our sales to those telecommunications operators  which would harm our business 
a significant portion of our customers are emerging telecommunications operators who compete against existing telecommunications companies 
these new participants only recently began to enter these markets  and many of these operators are still building their networks and rolling out their services 
they require substantial capital for the development  construction and expansion of their networks and the introduction of their services 
if emerging operators fail to acquire and retain customers or are unsuccessful in raising needed funds or responding to any other trends  such as price reductions for their services or diminished demand for telecommunications services in general  then they could be forced to reduce their capital spending programs 
if we fail to implement our strategy of purchasing equipment from and selling equipment to regional bell operating companies  our growth will suffer 
one of our strategies is to develop and expand our relationships with regional bell operating companies  or rbocs 
we believe the rbocs could provide us with a significant source of additional net revenue 
in addition  we believe the rbocs could provide us with a large supply of redeployed equipment 
we cannot assure you that the implementation of this strategy will be successful 
rbocs may not choose to sell redeployed equipment to us or may not elect to purchase this equipment from us 
rbocs may instead develop those capabilities internally or elect to compete with us and resell redeployed equipment to our customers or prospective customers 
if we fail to successfully develop our relationships with rbocs or if rbocs elect to compete with us  our growth could suffer 
if we do not continue to expand our international operations our growth could suffer 
we intend to continue expanding our business in international markets 
this expansion will require significant management attention and financial resources to develop a successful international business  including sales  procurement and support channels 
following this strategy  we opened our european headquarters in the fourth quarter of  and in established sales offices in singapore  brazil  sweden and russia 
however  we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for the equipment we sell  and therefore we might not be able to expand our international operations 
our experience in providing equipment outside the united states is increasing  but still developing 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our net revenue in  of our net revenue in  and of our net revenue in if we do engage in selective acquisitions  we may experience difficulty assimilating the operations or personnel of the acquired companies  which could threaten our future growth 
if we make acquisitions in the future  we could have difficulty assimilating or retaining the acquired companies personnel or integrating their operations  equipment or services into our organization 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
moreover  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs  impairment of goodwill  or amortization of acquired other intangible assets 
furthermore  we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities in any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities would be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
defects in the equipment we sell may seriously harm our credibility and our business 
telecommunications operators require a strict level of quality and reliability from telecommunications equipment suppliers 
telecommunications equipment is inherently complex and can contain undetected software or hardware errors 
if we deliver telecommunications equipment with undetected material defects  our reputation  credibility and equipment sales could suffer 
moreover  because the equipment we sell is integrated into our customers networks  it can be difficult to identify the source of a problem should one occur 
the occurrence of such defects  errors or failures could also result in delays in installation  product returns  product liability and warranty claims and other losses to us or our customers 
in some of our contracts  we have agreed to indemnify our customers against liabilities arising from defects in the equipment we sell to them 
furthermore  we supply most of our customers with warranties that cover the equipment we offer 
while we may carry insurance policies covering these possible liabilities  these policies may not provide sufficient protection should a claim be asserted 
a material product liability claim  whether successful or not  could be costly  damage our reputation and distract key personnel  any of which could harm our business 
our strategy to outsource services could impair our ability to deliver our equipment on a timely basis 
while we have expanded our services capability  we still currently depend on  to a large degree  third parties for a variety of equipment related services  including engineering  repair  transportation  testing  installation and de installation 
this outsourcing strategy involves risks to our business  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality and costs and the potential absence of adequate capacity 
in the event that any significant subcontractor was to become unable or unwilling to continue to perform their required services  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
this process could be lengthy  and we cannot be sure that additional sources of third party services would be available to us on a timely basis  or at all 
our quarterly net revenue and the price of our stock may be negatively impacted by the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers 
our quarterly net revenue may be subject to the seasonal purchasing patterns of our customers  which may occur as a result of our customers annual budgetary  procurement and sales cycles 
if our quarterly net revenue fails to meet the expectations of analysts due to those seasonal fluctuations  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
our ability to meet customer demand and the growth of our net revenue could be harmed if we are unable to manage our inventory needs accurately 
to meet customer demand in the future  we believe it is necessary to maintain or increase some levels of inventory 
failure to maintain adequate inventory levels in these products could hurt our ability to make sales to our customers 
in the past  we have experienced inventory shortfalls on certain high demand equipment  and we cannot be certain that we will not experience such shortfalls again in the future  which could harm our ability to meet customer demand 
further  rapid technology advancement could make portions of our existing inventory obsolete and cause us to incur losses 
in addition  if our forecasts lead to an accumulation of inventories that are not sold in a timely manner  our business could suffer 
the corruption or interruption of key software systems we use could cause our business to suffer if it delays or restricts our ability to meet our customers needs 
we rely on the integrity of key software and systems 
specifically we rely on our relationship management database which tracks information on currently or potentially available redeployed equipment 
this software and these systems may be vulnerable to harmful applications  computer viruses and other forms of corruption and interruption 
in the event any form of corruption or interruption affects our software or systems  it could delay or restrict our ability to meet our customers needs  which could harm our reputation or business 
if we are unable to meet our additional capital needs in the future  we may not be able to execute our business growth strategy 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy these requirements 
we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to o take advantage of business opportunities  including more rapid international expansion or acquisitions of complementary businesses  o develop and maintain higher inventory levels  o gain access to new product lines  o develop new services  or o respond to competitive pressures 
any additional financing we may need might not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our business could suffer if the inability to raise this funding threatens our ability to execute our business growth strategy 
moreover  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our current stockholders will be reduced 
newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of investors in our common stock 
in addition  the terms of any debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we face the risk of future non recurring charges in the event of impairment 
we adopted sfas beginning in january and  as a result  we no longer amortize goodwill 
however  we will continue to have amortization related to other purchased intangibles  and we must evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  at least annually for impairment 
for  our amortization charge for other intangibles was  if we determine that these items are impaired  we will be required to take a related non recurring charge to earnings 
our facilities could be vulnerable to damage from earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our main facilities are located on or near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
if a disaster occurs  our ability to test and ship the equipment we sell would be seriously  if not completely  impaired  and our inventory could be damaged or destroyed  which would seriously harm our business 
we cannot be sure that the insurance we maintain against fires  floods  earthquakes and general business interruptions will be adequate to cover our losses in any particular case 
our officers and directors exert substantial influence over us  and may make future business decisions with which some of our stockholders might disagree 
our executive officers  directors and entities affiliated with them beneficially own an aggregate of approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk we have reviewed the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosure of accounting policies for derivative commodity instruments and disclosure of quantitative and qualitative information about market risks inherent in derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments 
we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  substantially all of our revenue  purchases and capital spending is denominated in us dollars 
a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
this risk could become more significant as we expand business outside the us we invest our excess cash in short term  interest bearing  investment grade marketable securities 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
as of december   we had no long term debt outstanding
