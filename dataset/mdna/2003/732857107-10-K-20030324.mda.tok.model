item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations note certain information in this report constitutes forward looking statements within the meaning of federal securities laws 
forward looking information  which includes forecasted business divestitures and asset purchases  is subject to risks  trends  and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
those uncertainties include but are not limited to changes to regulations that affect the partnership s ability to harvest timber and develop real estate  economic conditions  which can have a significant effect on the price the partnership can obtain for its timber  real estate  and other investments  and each of those items discussed in risk and uncertainties  below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the partnership s audited consolidated financial statements included with this report 
results of operations the partnership operates in three primary business segments fee timber  timberland management and consulting  and real estate 
fee timber operations consist of the growing and harvesting of timber from the partnership s tree farms 
timberland management and consulting encompasses providing timberland management and forestry consulting services to third party owners of timberlands 
real estate includes the assets at port ludlow that were sold in august of and other investments in land 
certain of our critical accounting policies are discussed at the end of this section 
the partnership s consolidated gross revenues in   and  on a percentage basis by segment  are as follows segment fee timber timberland management and consulting real estate the partnership projects that  in  the relative percentages between the fee timber  timber management  and real estate segments will shift to   and  respectively  as a result of the loss from expiration of the htrg timberland management contract and closure of the canadian offices 
further segment financial information is presented in note to the partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report 
fee timber revenues and operating income fee timber revenue is earned primarily from the harvest and sale of logs from the partnership s  acres of fee timber located in western washington and to a lesser extent from the sale of gravel and cellular communication tower leases 
revenue and operating income generated by the fee timber segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended timber and other forest products mineral cell tower total fee timber revenue operating income december  million million million million december  million million million million december  million million million million fiscal year compared to fee timber revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the partnership in harvested million board feet mmbf up mmbf or from the harvest volume of mmbf 
in spite of this harvest volume difference  annual revenues for are lower than the prior year s revenues due to the sale of  acres of land and timber for million in the partnership s weighted average log price of per thousand board feet mbf for the year ending was down mbf or from the year ending operating income increased million  or  to million in from million in  largely due to the increase in harvest volume 
fiscal year compared to fee timber revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenue is largely the result of the aforementioned sale of  acres that generated revenue of million 
a smaller timberland sale from the hood canal tree farm generated an additional million in revenue in the land sale revenue was offset to some degree by an decline in average log prices and a decrease in harvest volume compared to operating income declined million  or  to million in from million in  primarily as the result of an increase in depletion expense recognized from harvested timber 
depletion expense has increased as a result of the higher average cost basis of the partnership s timber following the acquisition of the columbia tree farm see discussion of depletion accounting policy under accounting matters 
as discussed below  the decline in average log prices realized  and the decrease in harvest volume also negatively affected operating income 
the land sales resulted in operating income of million in the partnership regularly adjusts its timberland portfolio of holdings as part of its active management through acquisitions and dispositions of smaller parcels 
export log market 
log revenues from the partnership s timberland ownership are significantly affected by export log market conditions 
sales to the export market totaled   and of segment revenues for   and  respectively 
the majority of the partnership s export log volume is sold to japan 
indirect sales to the export market totaled mmbf  mmbf  and mmbf  of softwood logs for   and  respectively 
the decrease in volume sold through the export market in is indicative of the deteriorating export market conditions  a trend that also existed from to the average price per mbf realized for export logs sold was   and for   and  respectively 
the realized average export log price declined from to and from to  driven largely by weak economic conditions in japan  the growth of engineered wood products  and increased foreign competition in the export log market 
management is not projecting a significant improvement in the export market in the foreseeable future 
domestic log market 
domestic sawlog volumes were mmbf  mmbf  and mmbf in   and  respectively 
the increase in domestic volume sold in from represents a shift in volume from the export market to the domestic market together with an overall increase in harvest volume 
average realized domestic log prices per mbf were   and in   and  respectively 
prices realized from domestic log sales declined as the market became saturated with volume that was redirected away from weak export markets 
management expects to continue pursuing heavier sales volumes in domestic markets so long as overseas log markets remain relatively weak 
other timber products 
pulp  hardwood  and other log volumes represented   and of total harvest volume for   and  respectively 
the decrease in other timber volume sold as a percent of total volume in relative to and is due to improved log merchandising 
logs sold as pulp generally command lower prices than logs sold to the domestic market 
to the extent log volume can be moved from pulp logs to domestic sawlog sorts  higher revenue is realized 
other log prices were   and per mbf for   and  respectively 
the decline in other log prices in relative to and relative to reflects the overall decline in log prices during the past few years 
harvest volumes and seasonality 
the partnership harvested the following timber for each year in the three year period ended december  softwood sawlogs pulp  hardwood  and other totals year volume mmbf price mbf volume mmbf price mbf volume mmbf price mbf mmbf million board feet mbf thousand board feet the partnership s  acres of timberland consist of the  acre hood canal tree farm and the  acre columbia tree farm 
the partnership s hood canal tree farm is located in the hood canal region of washington state 
most of this tree farm acreage is at a relatively low elevation where harvest activities are possible year round 
as a result of this competitive advantage  the partnership is often able to harvest and sell a greater portion of its annual harvest in the first half of the year when the supply of logs in the marketplace tends to be lower 
during and  harvest activities tapered off towards the end of september or october as the partnership reached its planned annual harvest volume 
during the seasonality of our timber harvest was significantly reduced 
the columbia tree farm acreage is less accessible during the winter months and  therefore  harvest activities are concentrated in the period between may and november 
the overall impact to fee timber revenue from the columbia tree farm acquisition should be a flattening of the seasonal spikes experienced in previous years 
the percentage of annual harvest volume harvested by quarter for each year in the three year period ended december  is as follows year ended q q q q december  december  december  cost of sales fee timber cost of sales for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended depletion harvest  haul and other land sale costs total december  million million million december  million million million million december  million million million million depletion costs from harvest activities averaged   and per mbf for   and  respectively 
the depletion rate in represents one full year of harvest from the higher cost basis columbia tree farm 
blending the higher relative cost basis of the timber on the recently acquired columbia tree farm with hood canal tree farm s historical basis caused the depletion rate per mbf to increase from to depletion costs in also include million in depletion resulting from timberland sales  most notably stemming from the  acre sale of a portion of the columbia tree farm 
harvest  haul and other costs excluding costs resulting from timberland sales averaged   and per mbf for   and  respectively 
harvest costs vary based upon the physical site characteristics of acreage harvested 
land that is difficult to access  or located on steep hillsides  is more expensive to harvest 
haul costs vary based upon the distance between the harvest site and the customer s location 
average harvest  haul  and other costs increased in as a result of the acquisition of the columbia tree farm where harvest costs are greater than the hood canal tree farm as a result of the former s higher elevation and more mountainous terrain 
costs resulting from timberland sales were million and million in and  respectively 
the timberland sale costs in resulted from the aforementioned  acre sale of a portion of the columbia tree farm 
operating expenses fee timber operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were  million  and million  respectively 
beginning in operating expenses reflect incremental costs resulting from columbia tree farm operations 
timberland management and consulting revenues and operating income the timberland management and consulting segment earns revenue by providing timberland management and forestry consulting services to timberland owners and managers 
an additional aspect of that segment s activities  which management has mothballed in recent years  is the development of timberland property portfolios on behalf of third party clients 
management is assessing the activation of this strategy in light of new and continuing economic and market developments together with changes in the partnership s operating capabilities 
results below include revenue and expense associated with the timberland management contract with hancock timber resource group htrg 
the partnership s subsidiary  ormllc  was informed in the fourth quarter of of htrg s decision to integrate management of its client properties into operations with the corollary decision not to renew the timberland management contract with ormllc 
revenues and operating income for the timberland management and consulting segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended revenues operating income december  million million december  million million december  million million net of million of restructuring charges net of million in asset impairment and restructuring charges 
management expects that the non renewal of the htrg management contract will result in a reduction of timberland management and consulting revenues of approximately million in  however  management is pursuing management opportunities and other strategies that marry our capabilities with what the market is seeking in the way of services 
fiscal year compared to revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in revenue resulted from the renegotiation of a timberland management contract in mid the contract change resulted in a lower management fee offset in part by a larger fee earned upon disposition of the properties managed 
operating income declined million or 
the decrease in operating income is primarily due to million of restructuring charges recorded in the fourth quarter of following htrg s decision to not renew the management contract with ormllc and the closure of our canadian forestry consulting offices 
fiscal year compared to revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in revenue resulted principally from the aforementioned mid restructuring of our management contract to manage and sell more than  acres of industrial forestland in california  oregon  and washington 
operating income increased million to million in from million in however  excluding the million asset impairment charge taken in  operating income increased million 
the increase in operating income is the result of increasing efficiencies in our timberland management and consulting businesses 
the majority of the increase in efficiency resulted from a decrease in staffing to a more appropriate level given business volume 
operating expenses timberland management and consulting operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
operating expenses decreased in relative to as a result of reduced operating expenses in the forestry consulting business in canada offset by the million of restructuring charges recorded following the loss of the htrg contract and closure the forestry consulting offices in canada 
operating expenses decreased in relative to as a result of cost saving measures taken in response to downward adjustments in htrg s portfolio of timber properties and inclusion of the million asset impairment and restructuring charges in ipmb issues limitation on expenditures the amendment to the limited partnership agreement authorizing the ipmb strategy limits the partnership s cumulative net expenditures to  including debt guarantees 
as of december  cumulative expenditures incurred in pursuit of ipmb opportunities  including guarantees  were less than cumulative revenues generated 
therefore  cumulative net expenditures as of december  against the  limit are zero 
allocation of income the amendment to the limited partnership agreement further specifies that income from the ipmb will be split using a sliding scale allocation method beginning at to the partnership s wholly owned subsidiary  orm  inc  and to pope mgp  inc  the managing general partner of the partnership 
the sliding scale allocation method will evenly divide ipmb income between orm  inc and pope mgp  inc 
once such income reaches  in a given fiscal year 
real estate revenues and operating income real estate segment revenues are derived from land sales and rental income from income producing properties 
prior to august real estate revenues consisted of the sale of single family homes and developed lots  undeveloped acreage sales  and rents earned from income producing properties 
the majority of revenue and operating income generated by the real estate segment in and resulted from operations at the resort community of port ludlow  washington  as discussed in item business description of business segments real estate 
the partnership sold all the assets and operations in port ludlow in august segment results including port ludlow 
the discussion that follows includes the operations of the entire real estate segment 
revenue and operating loss in includes port ludlow and the remaining portion of the real estate segment that is continuing after sale of the port ludlow property 
revenues and operating loss for the real estate segment for each year in the three year period ended december   are as follows year ended revenues operating loss operating loss excluding nonrecurring items december  million million million december  million million million december  million million million includes million of environmental remediation charges related to port gamble and million of warranty charges related to port ludlow 
includes million in asset impairment charges related to the sale of port ludlow 
includes million in asset impairment and restructuring charges related to port ludlow  and million in environmental remediation charges related to port gamble 
fiscal year compared to revenue generated by the real estate segment decreased million  primarily due to the sale of port ludlow operations in august operating loss decreased million primarily due to fewer non cash charges in million in and million in and the sale of port ludlow in fiscal year compared to revenue generated by the real estate segment decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in revenue is primarily due to the sale of port ludlow on august  august and september are generally high volume months for both the commercial property and development businesses in port ludlow 
operating loss declined million  or  to million in from million in the decreased operating loss is primarily due to fewer non cash charges in million in and million in 
this favorable comparison was partially offset by a million decrease in results compared to because the portfolio of port ludlow income producing properties were not in place for the entire year 
segment results excluding port ludlow 
the sale of port ludlow represented a substantial shift in the nature of our real estate segment by focusing our real property assets solely on acquisition  development and resale of residential real estate 
as a result  a comparison of reporting periods that included results of operations of port ludlow may not present a meaningful comparison with periods that exclude those operations 
real estate operations following the sale of port ludlow continuing real estate operations consist of the rental of residential and commercial properties in port gamble and kingston  and the sale of developed lots at the seabeck and grandridge plats 
investments in land at gig harbor  bremerton  port gamble  kingston  and hansville are also included in the real estate segment following the port ludlow sale 
revenue and operating loss for the continuing real estate operations for each year in the three year period ended december  are as follows year ended revenues operating loss december  million million december  million million december  million million includes million in environmental remediation charges related to port gamble 
includes million in environmental remediation charges related to port gamble 
fiscal year compared to revenue generated by the continuing real estate operations increased million  or due to the sale of an office building and increased rental revenues generated from port gamble residential and commercial properties 
operating loss increased million due to the environmental remediation charge of million offset by modest increase in earnings from lot sales at the seabeck and grandridge plats 
all remaining lots from these plats were sold in fiscal year compared to revenue generated by the continuing real estate operations increased million  or  to million in from million in  as a result of a small increase in lots sold at the two remaining land plats of grandridge and seabeck 
operating loss decreased as a result of the million environmental remediation charge in that did not recur in cost of sales real estate cost of sales for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in costs of sales in relative to was due almost entirely to the sale of port ludlow 
the decrease in cost of sales in relative to reflects the mid sale of port ludlow and resulting decrease in homes sold from homes in to homes in cost of sales in the real estate segment are expected to be more in line with results for the next few years 
following the sale of port ludlow  the partnership s operations will no longer include the building and selling of homes 
real estate cost of sales will consist of miscellaneous land sales over the next few years as the real estate segment works to shepherd larger land investments through the entitlement process with the ultimate goal of selling the properties or positioning them for possible joint venture development 
operating costs real estate operating expenses for each of the three years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease in operating expenses in relative to is due to the sale of port ludlow offset by the million environmental remediation charge related to port gamble in the decrease in operating expenses as discussed below in relative to is also due to the sale of port ludlow offset by the million environmental remediation charge related to port gamble in operating expenses in port ludlow included the cost of operating several commercial properties and the cost of administering the partnership s real estate development activities in port ludlow 
following the sale of port ludlow  operating expenses of the real estate segment are expected to be more in line with results 
the number of employees in the real estate segment has decreased to five full time and up to eight part time employees at december  from full time and up to part time employees at december  impairment and restructuring costs in connection with the sale of the port ludlow assets  the partnership recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges of million in as a result of continued negotiations surrounding the sale  an additional million in asset impairment charges were recorded in march environmental remediation costs the partnership has an accrued liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the accrual represents estimated environmental remediation charges in and around the townsite of port gamble 
port gamble is a historic town that was owned by p t for decades until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t continued to lease the mill site at port gamble until january when a settlement agreement was signed between the partnership and p t  which divided up the responsibility for paying environmental remediation charges in port gamble 
the mill site had an operating lumber mill through that was dismantled by the end of the liability recorded represents management s estimate of the partnership s share of port gamble environmental remediation charges 
activity in the environmental remediation liability consists of the following balances at the beginning of the period charged to costs and expenses deductions balances at the end of the period year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  management is monitoring remediation activities at the port gamble townsite 
the liability level as of december  appears to be adequate to address the remaining remediation and monitoring activities that are expected to be necessary to complete the remediation project 
seasonality real estate operations have historically been very seasonal as a result of the resort properties at port ludlow 
after the sale of the port ludlow assets  real estate operations are not expected to be seasonal in the future 
general and administrative g a fiscal year compared to g a costs decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is due to continued efforts to realize cost savings from the partnership s administrative departments following the sale of operations at port ludlow offset by million of restructuring charges incurred in the partnership expects g a costs will be less than million for the year ending december  fiscal year compared to g a costs decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease is the result of downsizing in anticipation of the sale of port ludlow 
the majority of the decrease was from a reduction in administrative staff to at the end of from at the end of other income expense fiscal year compared to net interest expense decreased million to million in from million in the modest decrease is due to a slight decrease in debt outstanding in fiscal year compared to net interest expense increased million to million in from million in  as a result of the partnership s acquisition of the columbia tree farm in march the acquisition resulted in additional mortgage debt of million and revolving credit of million the latter of which was paid off through proceeds from the sale of port ludlow and cash generated from operations 
taxes fiscal year compared to an income tax benefit of million was recorded in compared to an expense of million in the income tax benefit in is the result of reducing the allowance on a deferred tax asset relating to net operating losses from a subsidiary in canada that was liquidated in the fourth quarter of fiscal year compared to the provision for income taxes increased million to million tax expense in from a tax benefit of million in as a result of improved operating results in the partnership s timberland management and consulting segment 
this business segment is conducted through corporate entities that are subject to federal and state income tax 
minority interest fiscal year compared to the minority interest charge decreased  to  in from  in the decrease in minority interest is due to the reduction in operating income from the partnership s timberland management activities following htrg s decision not to renew its management contract with ormllc 
fiscal year compared to the minority interest charge increased million to million from zero in the increase in minority interest is a result of improved operating results in the partnership s timberland management and consulting segment

liquidity and capital resources cash flows general 
the partnership generates operating cash flow through the sale of timber products  by providing timberland management and consulting services  and to a lesser extent by selling timberland and land for development 
an additional source of operating cash is payments received on a note receivable from the purchaser of the port ludlow assets 
this note  secured by homes and lots in port ludlow  has a balance of million at december   and matures in august significant recurring cash usage includes capital expenditures to replant and fertilize trees  maintain an adequate road system on the partnership s tree farms  invest in the partnership s development properties  fund annual debt payments on the timberland mortgage and local improvement district debt  and fund quarterly cash distributions 
the partnership had two major customers in representing and of consolidated revenues 
one of those major customers was htrg 
htrg informed the partnership in the fourth quarter of that they would not be renewing their timberland management contract in as of december  the partnership has million in cash 
the partnership may incur additional debt in the future to fund timberland purchases 
the partnership does not currently have a line of credit 
cash position 
the partnership s overall cash and cash equivalents increased to million at year end from million at year end working capital 
working capital including cash increased million to million at year end from million at year end  and the current ratio was to and 
to at year end and  respectively 
the increase in the current ratio was due to positive cash flow generated during in the current ratio decreased to 
to from to in due primarily to the sale of assets and operations in port ludlow that generated million in cash  offset by the acquisition of the columbia tree farm 
operations 
in consolidated net cash provided by operations was million as compared to million in the decrease in cash flow from operations is attributable primarily to a timberland sale  which resulted in million of cash flow that did not recur in this was offset by an increase in harvest activity together with an increase in cash collected on a contract receivable in relative to the contract receivable is from the purchaser of the assets at port ludlow 
cash flow from operations before changes in working capital provided million with a decrease in working capital providing million 
in cash flow from operations of million together with million in proceeds from the sale of an office building were used to fund million in fixed asset expenditures  million in long term debt paydowns  and million in unitholder distributions 
in consolidated net cash provided by operations was million including million of cash generated from the sale of timberland  an increase of million  or  from the million provided in cash flow from operations before changes in working capital provided million  with the decrease in working capital providing million 
in  cash flow from operations combined with cash reserves were used to fund million of the columbia tree farm acquisition and million in other capital expenditures  plus make debt payments of million 
cash provided by operating activities in was used for cash payments to unitholders of million  capital expenditures of million  repayment of long term debt of million  and a minority interest distribution of million 
investing activities 
the cash needed to meet the partnership s capital expenditures  investments and other requirements in was generated principally from internal cash flows 
in the partnership funded the purchase of the columbia tree farm from cash generated from internal cash flows combined with million in cash received from the sale of port ludlow and million in columbia tree farm mortgage financing 
capital expenditures by segment  excluding the columbia tree farm acquisition  over the past three years were as follows segment fee timber timber management and consulting real estate other total capital expenditures during consisted primarily of million in reforestation  road building and fertilization for the partnership s tree farms and million in capitalized property improvements at the port gamble townsite and the partnership s other land investments 
remaining capital expenditures consisted of miscellaneous equipment and vehicle purchases 
during the partnership expended million to purchase the columbia tree farm  using million in mortgage financing  million from the port ludlow sale proceeds and million from internal cash flows 
bridge financing in the form of a revolving debt facility was used to fund million of the columbia tree farm acquisition until the port ludlow sale and cash generated from operations were used to pay off the revolving debt facility 
other capital expenditures in totaled million  down from the million spent in  primarily due to reduced activity in the real estate segment 
financing activities 
the partnership decreased its interest bearing debt by million as a result of normal principal payments of million offset by new local improvement district debt of million 
in the partnership increased its interest bearing debt by million during the year through issuance of the million new mortgage on the hood canal tree farm used to purchase the columbia tree farm  and by paying down million in existing long term debt 
in  the partnership decreased its interest bearing debt by million 
the partnership s debt to total capital ratio was at the end of  as compared with at the end of at december  the partnership was in material compliance with all covenants and other obligations relating to its outstanding credit facilities 
the partnership did not sell any of its partnership units in or however  in the partnership paid  to repurchase  units in a privately negotiated transaction from one unitholder 
the partnership paid million in distributions during  which represents two quarterly distributions of five cents per unit 
management plans to continue making distributions of five cents per unit per quarter in so long as the funds are available therefor 
management will periodically examine the distribution policy to ensure it meets the long term objective of maximizing partnership value 
there were no such distributions in in the partnership paid million in distributions 
cash flow variables and timing the partnership has the following variabilities  among others  in its other sources of additional funds payments on port ludlow note 
the partnership received a note from the purchaser of the port ludlow assets in the amount of million 
that note is secured by a deed of trust on a defined set of lots and homes under construction at port ludlow 
at december  the balance of the note was million 
payments are due on the note as the underlying properties securing the note are sold 
the note matures in august fee timber harvest 
management has discretion to increase or decrease the level of logs cut and thereby may increase or decrease net income and cash flow  assuming log prices and demand remain stable 
management s current plan is to harvest approximately million board feet of timber from its tree farms in since harvest plans are based in part on demand and pricing  and in part on our harvest capacity  actual harvesting may vary subject to management s ongoing review 
moreover  in years when management increases harvest to provide stronger cash flow or to meet increased demand  that strategy will drive one of two primary actions in subsequent years 
those actions are to either reduce harvests and  correspondingly  cash flow or expend additional funds to acquire additional resources  as the partnership did with the columbia tree farm acquisition  to bridge the resulting age class or volume gaps in its timber base 
timber management property disposition 
in connection with one of the partnership s timberland management contracts  a fee for disposition services is earned when properties belonging to that client are sold 
in the partnership generated million in service fee revenue as a result of these disposition efforts 
fees earned in from similar services are contingent on closing transactions that are difficult to predict 
real estate disposition 
the partnership may realize value from its continuing real estate operations through a sale  or possibly through a joint venture with an experienced land developer 
the partnership does not expect significant sales revenue from this source within the next three years 
risks and uncertainties a number of known risks  some of which are discussed below  as well as various unknown risks and uncertainties  may cause the partnership s revenues to fall short of management s expectations 
although certain statements in this report are forward looking in nature  these known and unknown risks make it impossible for management to predict with any degree of certainty either quantitative factors such as cash flow  results of operations or financial condition  or qualitative factors such as management s plans  objectives  or responses to various events or occurrences 
readers therefore should recognize that statements other than those of historical fact are not guarantees or assurances of future performance  but are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
some of our forward looking statements can be identified by the use of predictive terms such as expect  anticipate  will  might  may  and words of similar meaning or construction 
the following section discusses some of the known risks that may cause the partnership s actual financial results to fall materially short of management s expectations  or that may cause management to deviate from its expressed intentions or predictions 
readers should also recognize that this list is not exhaustive  and in addition to those factors listed below  a wide range of risks faced by most or all participants in the timber industry or in international trade  as well as various unexpected events or conditions  may adversely impact our business 
competition generally the partnership competes against much larger companies in each of its business segments 
we compete with these companies for management and line personnel  as well as for purchases of relatively scarce capital assets such as land and standing timber and for sales of our products 
these larger competitors may have access to larger amounts of capital and significantly greater economies of scale  and they may be better able to absorb the risks of our line of business 
moreover  the timber industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years  and as that consolidation occurs  our relative market share decreases and the relative financial capacity of our competitors increases 
while management believes the partnership is at a competitive advantage over some of these companies because of management s attempts to diversify our asset base  we cannot assure readers that competition will not have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial condition 
fee timber competition and demand issues fee timber revenue is generated primarily through the sale of softwood logs to the domestic and export markets located in western washington 
the market for these products is significantly affected by fluctuations in us and japanese economies 
the market for the partnership s timber products is generally negatively affected by the rise in engineered lumber products that substitute for solid sawn products 
the rise in the use of engineered lumber products results in less of a premium for larger diameter douglas fir logs 
many of the engineered wood products are made from lower quality logs  which over time has eroded log prices and created more of a commoditization of wood fiber 
while timber sold is expected to realize lower prices with the rise in engineered wood products  wood fiber is expected to remain an important commodity that management expects will continue to be used extensively for building 
the proximity of lumber mills to the timberland supplying these mills is important to the partnership s profitability 
western washington has experienced a trend towards consolidation of lumber mills to fewer  larger volume manufacturers 
local demand for the partnership s products has remained strong through the trend towards consolidation of lumber mills in western washington 
if in the future that consolidation leads to less local competition for wood fiber  the partnership s profitability could be negatively impacted 
canadian lumber imports have increased over the last few years as a result  in part  of the protracted trade dispute between the us and canada  in which the us imposed duties on canadian lumber imports 
because these duties were based upon the average cost per mbf to produce lumber in canada  they had the inadvertent effect of increasing canadian production as producers worked to lower their per unit costs and thus lower their export duties  as measured on a per mbf basis 
this resulted in an increase of canadian lumber imports  which has had a negative impact on domestic lumber prices 
lower domestic lumber prices tend to decrease the price of logs sold domestically 
the impact to log prices of any eventual settlement to the trade dispute between the us and canada is difficult to predict 
the partnership s ability to grow and harvest timber can be significantly impacted by legislation to restrict or stop forest practices 
restrictions to logging  planting  road building  fertilizing  managing competing vegetation  and other activities can significantly increase the cost or reduce available inventory thereby reducing income 
timberland management and consulting over of timberland management and consulting revenue in was generated through two clients 
one of those clients  htrg  representing of the revenue in the timberland management and consulting segment  decided not to renew their contract with ormllc for the second client has renewed their contract  which now expires october  the partnership is working to expand its customer base through market outreach efforts 
the current market for timber products and timberland is relatively weak  which the partnership believes may create additional management and consulting opportunities as prospective clients look to lower costs and improve efficiencies 
however  we cannot assure readers that these plans will prove viable or that management will successfully implement those plans 
real estate the value of the partnership s real estate investments is subject to changes in the economic and regulatory environment 
the partnership s real estate investments are long term in nature  which raises the risk of unforeseen changes in the economy or laws surrounding development activities having an adverse affect on the partnership s investments 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and contingencies the partnership s commitments at december  consist of its revolving term loan  performance bonds  and operating leases entered into in the normal course of business 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for required principal payments on outstanding fixed rate debt 
payments due by period commitment expiration period obligation or commitment total less than year years years after years total debt performance bonds capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations the partnership also has total debt totaling million with the contractual maturities described in note of partnership s consolidated financial statements included with this report 
other long term obligations include the partnership s million contingent liability as of december  for environmental remediation in and around the port gamble townsite and million liability for a supplemental employment retirement plan 
the partnership expects to spend million of these liabilities in and million thereafter 
during the partnership increased the environmental liability by million following advice of environmental consultants that the costs to complete the remediation project were expected to exceed the original estimate 
the partnership may from time to time be a defendant in lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that loss to the partnership  if any  will not have a material adverse effect to the partnership s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
capital expenditures and commitments capital expenditures in are currently expected to be approximately million  however  these expenditures could be increased or decreased as a consequence of future economic conditions 
the partnership expects that the funds for these expenditures will be generated internally through operations and externally through financing 
government regulation compliance with laws  regulations  and demands usually involves capital expenditures as well as operating costs 
the partnership cannot easily quantify future amounts of capital expenditures required to comply with laws  regulations  and demands  or the effects on operating costs  because in some instances compliance standards have not been developed or have not become final or definitive 
accordingly  at this time the partnership has not included herein a quantification of future capital requirements to comply with any new regulations being developed by the united states or canadian regulatory agencies 
additionally  many federal and state environmental regulations  as well as local zoning and land use ordinances  place limits upon various aspects of our operations 
these limits include restrictions on our harvest methods and volumes  remediation requirements that may increase our post harvest reclamation costs  endangered species act limitations on our ability to harvest in certain areas  zoning and development restrictions that impact our real estate segment  and a wide range of other existing and pending statutes and regulations 
various initiatives are presented from time to time that seek further restrictions on timber and real estate development businesses  and although management currently is not aware of any material noncompliance with applicable law  we cannot assure readers that we ultimately will be successful in complying with all such regulations or that additional regulations will not ultimately have a material adverse impact upon our business

critical accounting policies and estimates the partnership believes its most critical accounting policies and estimates include those related to management s calculation of timber depletion and liabilities related to matters such as environmental remediation  and potential asset impairments 
in relation to liabilities  potential impairments and other estimated charges  it is management s policy to conduct ongoing reviews of significant accounting policies and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial results of the partnership 
the assumptions used are tested against available and relevant information and reviewed with subject matter experts for consistency and reliability 
during the preparation of financial results  tests are conducted to ascertain that the net book carrying values of assets are not in excess of fair values 
these tests use current market information  if available  or other generally accepted valuation methods  such as future cash flows 
when the use of estimates is necessary  an exact answer is unlikely  and therefore  the reporting within a range of likely outcomes is used in the preparation of the financial statements 
tests are also applied in order to be reasonably assured that liabilities are properly reflected on the records of the partnership and that the notes to the financial statements are prepared in a fashion that informs readers of possible outcomes and risks associated with the conduct of business 
depletion depletion represents the cost of timber harvested and is charged to operations by applying a depletion rate to volume harvested during the period 
the depletion rate is calculated on january st of each year by dividing the partnership s cost of merchantable timber by the volume of merchantable timber 
merchantable timber is defined as timber that is equal to or greater than years of age 
the cost of replanting acres harvested is initially capitalized to pre merchantable timber 
after years  such costs are reclassified from pre merchantable to merchantable timber and are then incorporated into the cost base for purposes of calculating the depletion rate 
the cost of acquiring the columbia tree farm was allocated to the age classes of timber purchased and are rolled into merchantable timber inventory when those stands turn years old 
inventory volumes take into account the applicable state and federal regulatory limits on timber harvests as applied to the partnership s properties  including the new forests and fish law that supplements washington state s forest practice regulations to provide for expanded riparian management zones  wildlife leave trees  and other harvest restrictions 
the timber inventory volume is accounted for by the partnership s standing timber inventory system  which utilizes periodic statistical sampling of the timber cruising with annual adjustments made for estimated growth and the depletion of areas harvested 
to calculate the depletion rate the partnership has determined that a combined pool representing costs and volume of both the hood canal and columbia tree farms is the most appropriate method to use 
the partnership s decision to calculate a pooled rate representing both tree farms versus a separate rate for each tree farm gave considerable weight to a key reason for the columbia tree farm acquisition namely  to fill in an age class gap on the hood canal tree farm 
a combined pool approach is consistent with the way in which the tree farms are managed as a single investment 
given that the tree farms are managed as a single investment it was deemed appropriate to apply one rate to both tree farms even though the cost basis for each are different 
depletion expense in of million would have been approximately million higher had the partnership calculated depletion expense using separate pools in fertilization costs the partnership fertilized stands in that it expects to harvest within five to ten years 
in million of these costs have been capitalized and will be depleted as the fertilized stands are harvested 
road costs the cost of building and significant resurfacing work on permanently maintained roads is capitalized 
capitalized road costs are expensed as timber is harvested by applying an amortization rate representing the capitalized road costs divided by estimated merchantable inventory as used in the depletion calculation discussed above to the volume of timber harvested during the reporting period 
the cost of building temporary roads and maintaining roads is expensed as incurred 
during the partnership capitalized million of road costs  depleted million of capitalized road costs  and expensed million for road maintenance and temporary roads 
environmental remediation the environmental remediation liability represents estimated payments to be made to remedy and monitor certain areas in and around the townsite of port gamble 
port gamble is a historic town that was operated by pope talbot  inc p t  a related party  until when the townsite and other assets were spun off to the partnership 
p t leased the mill site at port gamble through january  when it signed an agreement with the partnership dividing the responsibility for environmental remediation of port gamble between the two parties 
the environmental remediation liability is based upon an estimate of the partnership s portion of the clean up costs under this agreement 
during the environmental liability increased million as a result of costs to complete the partnership s share exceeding the original estimate 
while the majority of the partnership s portion of the clean up efforts are complete  there remains the possibility that the remaining remediation or monitoring activities may exceed estimates resulting in an additional environmental remediation charge 
deferred tax assets the partnership has a united states subsidiary corporation that has million of deferred tax assets as of december  the majority of this balance represents net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the liquidation of our subsidiary in canada 
the partnership forecasts that the united states subsidiary corporation will earn income over the next five years resulting in the utilization of this tax asset 
land development costs our real estate department is working to bring properties to the point where physical construction of the properties planned end use can begin 
the extent of such efforts varies from property to property but the process for each discrete parcel has elements in common with other parcels 
we refer to these efforts as the entitlement process 
the entitlement process may consist of one or more of the following steps obtaining the necessary amendments to a county s comprehensive plan  pursuing zoning adjustments  developing site plans and a preliminary plat for the property  ensuring adequate access to the property  and making available necessary access to utilities such as water  power and sewer 
for projects where changes to zoning or comprehensive plan comp plan provisions are required  costs incurred in the entitlement process prior to securing such changes will be expensed 
the rationale for this is that there are too many uncertainties and contingencies attached to zoning and comp plan changes 
where the zoning and or comp plan is inconsistent with the planned project  the probability of success is sufficiently low that expensing of costs pursuant to such rezone or comp plan amendments is deemed appropriate 
for projects not requiring a rezone or change to a comp plan or  once such changes are secured if applicable  entitlement process costs for such projects will be capitalized 
such capitalized costs will include salary costs to the extent that an employee s efforts are primarily dedicated to furthering development of the project 
during the partnership capitalized million and expensed million of land development costs 
accounting for unit options the partnership accounts for employee unit based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  compensation cost for unit options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the partnership s units at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the unit 
unit options granted have an exercise price not less than the fair value of the partnership s unit price on the date of the grant 
had compensation expense for unit option grants been recognized based on the fair value at the grant date consistent with the black scholes method described in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  the partnership s net income would have included a million expense for the cost of options vesting during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   the partnership had million of fixed rate debt outstanding with a fair value of approximately million based on the current interest rates for similar financial instruments 
a change in the interest rate on fixed rate debt will affect the fair value of the debt  whereas a change in the interest rate on variable rate debt will affect interest expense and cash flows 
a hypothetical change in prevailing interest rates would change the fair value of the partnership s fixed rate long term debt obligations by million 
since the partnership s currently outstanding debt is fixed rate  net income and cash flows are not affected when market interest rates change 
foreign currency risk the partnership s timberland management and consulting activities in british columbia resulted in us million in revenue and million in expenses in that were denominated in canadian dollars 
during the fourth quarter of the partnership closed its offices in canada and expects future canadian dollar denominated transactions not to be material
