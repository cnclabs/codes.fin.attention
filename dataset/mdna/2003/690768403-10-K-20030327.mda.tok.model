ebit of the plastics packaging segment decreased million  or  to million  compared to million in increased shipments of plastic containers and closures for food and health care  including prescription products  were more than offset by lower shipments of plastic containers for juice and other beverages and one time costs associated with the relocation of a us manufacturing operation to a new and larger facility to accommodate a growing business base 
eliminations and other retained items  excluding the and unusual items  declined million from reflecting lower net financial services income due to the sale of the company s harbor capital advisors business  higher spending on information systems  and certain employee benefit costs increases 
restructuring and impairment charges the operating results included pretax charges of million related to the following charges of million principally related to a restructuring program and impairment at certain of the company s international and domestic operations 
the charge included the impairment of assets at the company s affiliate in puerto rico and the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and the closing of a facility in venezuela 
the program also included consolidation of capacity at certain other international and domestic facilities in response to decisions about pricing and market strategy and a charge of million related to restructuring manufacturing capacity in the medical devices business 
the company substantially completed these restructuring programs during the cost savings from the restructuring programs were not material 
the operating results included a pretax charge of million  principally related to a restructuring and capacity realignment program 
the restructuring and capacity realignment program  initiated in the third quarter of  included the consolidation of manufacturing capacity and a reduction of employees in the us salaried work force  or about  principally as a result of early retirement incentives 
also included in the charge was a write down of plant and equipment for the company s glass container affiliate in india and certain other asset write offs  including million for software which was abandoned 
manufacturing capacity consolidations principally involved us glass container facilities and reflected technology driven improvements in productivity  conversions of some juice and similar products to plastic containers  decisions regarding pricing and volume  and the further concentration of production in the most strategically located facilities 
the restructuring and capacity realignment program was substantially completed at the end of asbestos related charge the asbestos related charge of million million after tax represented an adjustment of the reserve for estimated future asbestos related costs 
following the completion of a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs in april  the company concluded that an increase in the reserve was required to provide for estimated indemnity payments and legal fees arising from asbestos personal injury lawsuits and claims expected to be filed in the next several years 
asbestos related cash payments were million for  down from million for the company expects that asbestos related cash payments will be moderately lower in the company anticipates that cash flows from operations and other resources will be sufficient to meet all asbestos related obligations 
the company believes that its ultimate asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the company s ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the united states  the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards  the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits  the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure  and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy 
the company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and has continued to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the company 
as a result  the company continues to evaluate trends to determine whether future adjustments of the asbestos related liabilities may be appropriate 
a former business unit of the company produced a minor amount of specialized high temperature insulation material containing asbestos from until  when the business was sold 
in line with its limited involvement with an asbestos containing product and its exit from that business over years ago  the company will continue to work aggressively to minimize the number of incoming cases and to limit payments to only those impaired claimants who were exposed to the company s products and whose claims have merit under applicable state law 
as of december   the number of pending asbestos related claimants and plaintiffs decreased to approximately  from the previously reported level of approximately  at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
capital resources and liquidity the company s total debt at december  was billion  compared to billion at december  during april  certain of the company s subsidiaries entered into the secured credit agreement the agreement with a group of banks  which expires on march  the agreement provides for a billion billion initially revolving credit facility 
the agreement also initially provided for a billion term loan which was repaid with the proceeds from the sale of the company s harbor capital advisors business and the issuance of senior secured notes in as discussed below 
at december   the company had available credit totaling billion under the agreement  of which million had not been utilized 
at december   the company had million of credit which had not been utilized under the agreement 
cash provided by operating activities was million for compared to million for during january  a subsidiary of the company issued billion of senior secured notes 
the notes bear interest at and are due february  the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
the assets of substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the notes 
the issuing subsidiary used the net cash proceeds from the notes to reduce the outstanding term loan under the agreement by million 
as a result  the company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees in january related to the term loan and recorded an extraordinary charge of million less applicable income taxes of million 
the indenture for the notes restricts  among other things  the ability of the company s subsidiaries to borrow money  pay dividends on  or redeem or repurchase stock  make investments  create liens  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
during the fourth quarter of  a subsidiary of the company issued senior secured notes totaling million 
the notes bear interest at and are due november  the notes are guaranteed by substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
the assets of substantially all of the company s domestic subsidiaries are pledged as security for the notes 
the issuing subsidiary used the net cash proceeds from the notes to repay the remaining million of the outstanding term loan under the agreement and to permanently reduce the revolving credit facility under the agreement by million 
as a result  the company wrote off unamortized deferred financing fees related to the term loan and the revolver and recorded an extraordinary charge of million less applicable income taxes of million 
the indenture for the new notes has the same restrictions as the senior secured notes issued in january the billion of senior secured notes noted above that were issued during are part of the company s plan to obtain longer term financing by issuing long term fixed rate debt 
while this strategy extends the maturity of the company s debt  the long term fixed rate debt increases the cost of borrowing over the shorter term  variable rate debt 
the company expects that the higher cost debt will add approximately million to interest expense in in  the company expects to continue refinancing its existing debt  including the agreement  which may include the replacement of more of its shorter term  lower cost  variable rate debt with longer term  higher cost  fixed rate debt 
the agreement contains covenants and provisions that  among other things  restrict the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to dispose of assets  incur additional indebtedness  prepay other indebtedness or amend certain debt instruments  pay dividends  create liens on assets  enter into contingent obligations  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions  engage in mergers or consolidations  change the business conducted  or engage in certain transactions with affiliates and otherwise restrict certain corporate activities 
in addition  the agreement contains financial covenants that require the company to maintain specified financial ratios and meet specified tests based upon financial statements of the company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  including minimum fixed charge coverage ratios  maximum leverage ratios  minimum net worth and specified capital expenditure tests 
the company anticipates that cash flow from its operations and from utilization of credit available through march under the agreement will be sufficient to fund its operating and seasonal working capital needs  debt service and other obligations 
the company expects that its total asbestos related payments in will be moderately lower than based on the company s expectations regarding future payments for lawsuits and claims and also based on the company s expected operating cash flow  the company believes that the payment of any deferred amounts of previously settled or otherwise determined lawsuits and claims  and the resolution of presently pending and anticipated future lawsuits and claims associated with asbestos  will not have a material adverse effect upon the company s liquidity on a short term or long term basis 
the following information summarizes the company s significant contractual cash obligations at december  millions of dollars 
payments due by period total less than one year years years contractual cash obligations long term debt    capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations   amount of commitment expiration per period total less than one year years years other commercial commitments lines of credit included in the long term debt in the table above standby letters of credit guarantees total commercial commitments   critical accounting estimates the company s analysis and discussion of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis  including but not limited to those related to pension benefit plans  contingencies and litigation  and goodwill 
estimates and assumptions are based on historical and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates may form the basis of the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities and may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  under conditions and circumstances different from those assumed  may differ from estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to estimates and assumptions are discussed within management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements  if applicable  where estimates and assumptions affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
the company believes that accounting for pension benefit plans  contingencies and litigation  and goodwill involves the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
pension benefit plans because of their historically well funded status  the company s principal defined benefit pension plans contributed pretax credits to earnings of approximately million for and approximately million for the decrease in pretax pension credits is attributed to lower expected return on assets and the addition of pension obligations with the acquisition of the canadian glass container assets of consumers packaging inc the determination of pension obligations and the related pension credits involves significant estimates 
the most significant estimates are the discount rate used to calculate the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on assets used in calculating the pension credits for the year 
the company uses a discount rate based on yields of highly rated fixed income debt securities at the end of the year 
at december   the weighted average discount rate for all plans was 
the company uses an expected long term rate of return that is based on the past performance of the various plans assets and an estimate of the future performance of the assets 
for the year ended december   the weighted average expected long term rate of return for all plans was 
declines in the stock market over the last few years have reduced the fair value of the company s pension plan assets  which  in turn  has caused reduced credits to earnings 
in  the company also expects to reduce its assumed rate of return on pension assets to a weighted average expected long term rate of approximately 
the lower assumed rate  combined with a lower asset base  will cause the pretax credits to earnings to be substantially lower for the full year of as compared to the company expects that these credits will be approximately million  or  lower in than for future effects on reported results of operations depend on economic conditions and investment performance 
for example  a one half percentage point change in the actuarial assumption regarding the expected return on assets would result in a change of approximately million in pretax pension credits for the full year 
in addition  changes in external factors  including the fair values of plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate plan liabilities  could result in possible future balance sheet recognition of additional minimum pension liabilities 
the company s principal pension plan in the united kingdom had an accumulated benefit obligation abo which exceeded the fair value of the plan s assets at december  as a result  the company eliminated the prepaid pension asset related to that plan and recorded  as of december   a minimum pension liability of million  an intangible asset of million  and accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
at december   the company s principal pension plans in the united states and australia had plan assets with fair values in excess of each plan s abo 
if the abo of these plans exceeds the fair value of their assets at december   the company will be required to write off most of its prepaid pension asset million at december  and record a liability equal to the excess of the abo over the fair value of the assets 
the noncash charge would result in a decrease in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of share owners equity that would significantly reduce net worth 
contingencies and litigation the company believes that its ultimate asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the company s ability to reasonably estimate its liability has been significantly affected by the volatility of asbestos related litigation in the united states  the expanding list of non traditional defendants that have been sued in this litigation and found liable for substantial damage awards  the continued use of litigation screenings to generate new lawsuits  the large number of claims asserted or filed by parties who claim prior exposure to asbestos materials but have no present physical impairment as a result of such exposure  and the growing number of co defendants that have filed for bankruptcy 
the company believes that the bankruptcies of additional co defendants have resulted in an acceleration of the presentation and disposition of a number of claims  which would otherwise have been presented and disposed of over the next several years 
the company continues to monitor trends which may affect its ultimate liability and continues to analyze the developments and variables affecting or likely to affect the resolution of pending and future asbestos claims against the company 
the company expects to complete a comprehensive review of its asbestos related liabilities and costs in connection with finalizing and reporting its results for  and annually thereafter  unless significant changes in trends or new developments warrant an earlier review 
if the results of this annual comprehensive review indicate that the existing amount of the accrued liability is insufficient to cover its estimated liabilities  then the company will record an appropriate charge to increase the accrual 
the company s estimates are based on a number of factors as described further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill beginning in  the company will evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
goodwill impairment testing is performed using the business enterprise value bev of each reporting unit which is calculated as of a measurement date by determining the present value of debt free  after tax future cash flows  discounted at the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
this bev is then compared to the book value of each reporting unit as of the measurement date to assess whether an impairment exists 
the annual impairment testing performed as of october  indicated that there was no impairment of any of the reporting units of the company 
if the company s projected debt free  after tax cash flows were substantially lower  or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were substantially higher  the testing may have indicated an impairment of one or more reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would have been written down 
however  based on the company s testing as of october   modest changes in the projected cash flows or cost of capital would not create impairment in reporting units 
for example  if projected debt free  after tax cash flows were decreased by  or alternatively if the weighted average cost of capital were increased by  the resulting lower bev s would still exceed the book value of each reporting unit and no impairment would exist 
in the event the company would be required to record a significant write down of goodwill  the charge would have a material adverse effect on reported results of operations and net worth 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in interest rates  and changes in commodity prices  principally natural gas 
the company uses certain derivative instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuating natural gas prices 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities conducted by affiliates in foreign jurisdictions 
the primary foreign markets served by the company s affiliates are in australia  south america principally colombia  brazil and venezuela  and europe principally italy  the united kingdom  and poland 
in general  revenues earned and costs incurred by the company s major foreign affiliates are denominated in their respective local currencies 
consequently  the company s reported financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or highly inflationary economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company s affiliates operate 
when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the reported dollar value of local currency ebit generally decreases  when the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the reported us dollar value of local currency ebit generally increases 
subject to other business and tax considerations  the company s strategy is to generally redeploy any affiliates available excess funds through intercompany loans to other affiliates for debt repayment  capital investment  or other cash requirements 
each intercompany loan is denominated in the lender s local currency and the borrower enters into a forward exchange contract which effectively swaps the intercompany loan and related interest to its local currency 
because the company s foreign affiliates operate within their local economic environment  the company believes it is appropriate to finance those operations with local currency borrowings to the extent practicable where debt financing is required 
considerations which influence the amount of such borrowings include long and short term business plans  tax implications  and the availability of borrowings with acceptable interest rates and terms 
in those countries where the local currency is the designated functional currency  this strategy mitigates the risk of reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
in those countries where the us dollar is the designated functional currency  however  local currency borrowings expose the company to reported losses or gains in the event the foreign currency strengthens or weakens against the us dollar 
the company s secured credit agreement requires that all borrowings other than borrowings under certain limited overdraft facilities  be denominated in us dollars 
as of december   us dollar amounts outstanding under the agreement borrowed by foreign affiliates were affiliate location millions of us dollars australia united kingdom a significant portion of the above borrowings and of the intercompany loans have been swapped into local currencies using currency swaps 
the company accounts for these swaps as fair value hedges 
as a result  the changes in the value of the swaps are included in other expense and are expected to substantially offset any exchange rate gains or losses on the related us dollar borrowings 
as of december   the company s affiliate in australia has swapped million of borrowings into  million australian dollars 
this swap matures on may   with interest resets every days 
the interest reset terms of the swap approximate the terms of the us dollar borrowings 
this derivative instrument swaps both the interest and principal from us dollars to australian dollars and also swaps the interest rate from a us based rate to an australian based rate 
the company s affiliate in the united kingdom has swapped million of bank loans and intercompany borrowings into million british pounds 
this swap also matures on may   with interest resets every days 
this derivative instrument swaps both the interest and principal from us dollars to british pounds and also swaps the interest rate from a us based rate to a british based rate 
the company s affiliates in australia and in the united kingdom have also entered in short term forward exchange contracts which effectively swap additional intercompany and external borrowings at each of these affiliates to its local currency 
these hedges swap both the interest and principal of additional borrowings in excess of the two major swap contracts mentioned above 
as of december   the company s canadian affiliate has swapped million of borrowings into million canadian dollars 
this swap matures on october  this derivative instrument swaps both the interest and principal from us dollars to canadian dollars and also swaps the interest rate from a us based rate to a canadian based rate 
the remaining portion of the company s consolidated debt which was denominated in foreign currencies was not significant 
the company believes it does not have material foreign currency exchange rate risk related to local currency denominated financial instruments ie cash  short term investments  and long term debt of its foreign affiliates 
interest rate risk the company s interest expense is most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates applicable to its us dollar indebtedness 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in variable interest rates  the company could  at its option  convert to fixed interest rates by either refinancing variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or entering into interest rate swaps 
the following table provides information about the company s significant interest rate risk at december  outstanding fair value millions of dollars variable rate debt secured credit agreement  matures march revolving loans  interest at a eurodollar based rate plus fixed rate debt senior secured notes  due    due senior notes  due  due  due  due senior debentures  due  due commodity risk the company is exposed to fluctuations of various commodity prices  most significantly the changes in prices related to natural gas 
the company purchases a significant amount of natural gas at nationally quoted market prices 
the company uses commodity futures contracts related to a portion of its forecasted natural gas requirements 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and the potential volatility in earnings or cash flows from future market price movements 
the company continually evaluates the natural gas market in respect to its future usage requirements 
the company generally evaluates the natural gas market for the next twelve months and continually enters into commodity futures contracts in order to have a portion of its usage requirements hedged through the next twelve months 
at december   the company has entered into commodity futures contracts for approximately of its north american natural gas usage through the end of approximately  mm btus 
at december   an unrealized net gain of million  after tax of million  related to these commodity futures contracts was included in other comprehensive income
