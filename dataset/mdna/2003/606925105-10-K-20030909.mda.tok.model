the company s total revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased to million in fiscal mobius derives its revenues from product licenses  related annual maintenance and professional services and other 
this year  of total revenues were generated from software licenses  were generated from maintenance and were generated from professional services and other 
mobius believes that the decrease in license revenue in fiscal was impacted by the global economic recession and the disappointing response of the company s customers to sales and marketing initiatives 
in an effort to improve its sales and marketing initiatives  the company refocused its sales and marketing team under new leadership and implemented new productivity strategies 
as a result  mobius believes that license revenues increased in fiscal due to increased licensing of mobius products by existing and new customers of the company 
in fiscal  mobius began to market licenses of viewdirect tcm products under the term solution packs 
solution packs are bundles of server products and client products designed to address specific customer applications and requirements with  generally  license terms of five years 
the company has entered into a significant number of license contracts having extended payment terms 
if the level of software license revenues financed by installment receivable continues at the current rate  the company s cash position is likely to be adversely affected 
license revenues of viewdirect and documentdirect products have historically accounted for a majority of the company s license revenues and for a significant portion of total revenues 
this year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues 
last year license revenues for these products accounted for approximately of license revenues 
the company anticipates that  for the foreseeable future  license revenue from these products will continue to account for a significant portion of license and total revenues 
maintenance revenues increased from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year due primarily to the growth in the amount of licensed software covered by maintenance agreements and increases in the maintenance fees charged by the company 
maintenance revenue consists primarily of fees for customer support services and enhancements provided by the company for its products 
in fiscal  mobius began to market licenses of viewdirect tcm products under the term solution packs 
historically  mobius has charged primarily of contract value for server product annual maintenance and primarily of contract value for client product annual maintenance  with a significant portion of the maintenance contracts covering server products 
annual maintenance for solution packs is based on of the contract value 
if a significant portion of the company s revenues is derived from solution packs and its customer base remains the same  maintenance revenues could potentially decrease 
during the past two fiscal years  mobius dedicated more resources to the development of the company s professional service business and entered into more professional service arrangements 
as a result  professional service and other revenue has increased from million in fiscal to million last year to million this year 
other revenues in all years were not significant 
international revenues increased this year to million from million last year 
international revenues were million in fiscal during fiscal  mobius believes that the economic recession and the disappointing response of its customers to sales and marketing initiatives contributed to mobius selling fewer licenses of its products to new and existing international customers 
during fiscal  international revenues increased due primarily to the effect of the change in the exchange rates from the previous year 
as a group  the company s international subsidiaries have been unprofitable to date  and mobius expects achieving profitability will continue to require significant management attention  increased revenues and financial resources 
the majority of mobius s current international revenues are derived from the operations of its wholly owned subsidiaries and through agents 
the company s subsidiaries conduct business in the currency of the country in which they operate  exposing mobius to currency fluctuations and currency transaction losses or gains  which are outside of mobius s control 
prior to fiscal  losses at mobius s international subsidiaries had not been consolidated for united states income tax purposes 
consequently  prior to fiscal  the company has experienced a reduced effective tax benefit versus the us federal statutory rate  as no tax benefit had been provided for the majority of international losses 
during fiscal  the company made certain us federal income tax elections which allowed certain of these international tax losses to be included within its us federal consolidated income tax return 
these elections  in part  have caused the company s effective tax rate to approach the us federal statutory rate in fiscal in fiscal  exclusive of certain tax benefits  the company experienced an increased effective tax rate due to certain subsidiary losses that could not be consolidated for us tax purposes and foreign tax liabilities of certain international subsidiaries for which no us foreign tax credit was available 
in the future  to the extent the company is successful at bringing its international subsidiaries to profitability  the company s effective tax rate could again exceed the us federal statutory rate depending on the availability of operating loss carryforwards in the profitable international jurisdictions and the operation of foreign tax credit limitations 
critical accounting policies and estimates mobius s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon mobius s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates are evaluated on an on going basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that its significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of mobius s consolidated financial statements are influenced by the following critical accounting policies  among others 
revenue recognition the company recognizes license and maintenance revenue in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
the company generates license revenues from licensing the rights to use its software products to its customers 
the company also generates maintenance and professional service revenues from renewable support and software enhancements maintenance and from consulting activities performed for license customers 
revenue from software license contracts includes fees related to licenses with terms generally of or years 
revenues from software license agreements are recognized upon delivery of the software if evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
the company allocates revenue on software arrangements involving multiple elements to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value allocable to each element 
generally  mobius s contracts include a software license and an obligation to provide maintenance 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  where the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
accordingly  when the company enters into a contract that includes both a software license and an obligation to provide maintenance  the maintenance revenue is unbundled from the initial license fee and recognized ratably over the maintenance period  starting from the inception of the software license agreement 
the company determines the portion of the contract price attributable to maintenance which may not necessarily track the allocation between license and maintenance fees set out in the contract using a percentage derived from mobius s pricing structure 
the unbundled portion of such maintenance revenue is classified as deferred revenue  with amounts extending beyond one year reported as non current deferred revenue 
if evidence of the fair value for undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such evidence exists or until all elements are delivered 
the company offers installment contracts to its customers  which provide for payments in installments  generally over periods ranging from to years 
under such contracts  software license revenue reflects the present value of future payments under non cancelable license arrangements 
the company has an established business practice of offering installment contracts to customers and has a history of successfully enforcing original payment terms on these contracts without making concessions 
in addition  the payment obligations are unrelated to product implementation or any other post transaction activity  therefore  revenues from installment contracts are generally recognized in the same manner as those requiring current payment 
in the case of installment contracts  software license revenue includes the present value of future payments 
a portion of the discount is recognized as interest income over the term of the arrangement 
maintenance revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the support  typically months 
the unearned portion of maintenance revenue is classified as deferred revenue 
professional service revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in accordance with this method  revenue from professional service contracts is recognized based on the percentage of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project 
the financial reporting for these contracts depends on estimates  which are regularly assessed and subject to revision as the contract progresses to completion 
when the current estimate of total contract costs indicates that a contract will result in a loss  a provision for the full loss is recognized 
software development costs statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  requires the capitalization of certain software development costs once technological feasibility is established 
the capitalized costs are then amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated product life  or on the ratio of current revenues to total projected product revenues  whichever is greater 
the company determines technological feasibility based on the working model method 
the period between establishment of a working model and the availability of mobius s software has historically been short and  accordingly  software development costs qualifying for capitalization have been insignificant 
as a result  the company has expensed all software development costs 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the use of the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  net operating loss carryforwards  and tax credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized

since the technological feasibility of the research and development projects has not yet been achieved and mobius believes such projects have no alternative future use  the acquired in process research and development was expensed immediately

the company s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
quarterly revenues and operating results are expected to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including without limitation  fluctuations in period to period results  seasonality  uncertainty of future operating results  technological change  product concentration  competition  international sales and operations  expansion of indirect channels  increased investment in professional services  extended payment risk  protection of intellectual property  dependence on licensed technology  risk of product defects  product liability  management of growth  dependence on executive management  other key employees and subcontractors  whether the internet can accommodate continued growth and concerns about transaction security on the internet 
license revenues typically peak primarily in the fourth fiscal quarter ending june and to a lesser extent in the second fiscal quarter ending december 
these fluctuations are caused primarily by customer purchasing patterns and the company s sales force incentive programs which recognize and reward sales personnel on the basis of achievement of annual and other periodic performance quotas  as well as the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources since its inception  mobius has funded its operations principally through cash flows from operating activities and  to a lesser extent  equity or bank financings

mobius s sources of cash during fiscal were collections of accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue  offset by an increase in software license installments and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
software license installments  which increased from million at june  to million at june   represent payments due from customers for license fees that are paid over the term of the installment agreement 
this increase was due to a proportionately greater amount of current license revenues being financed by the company 
for additional information  see the section entitled  software license installments receivable below 
net accounts receivable decreased from million at june  to million at june  net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in cash provided by investing activities in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to the decrease in the net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities

marketable securities of million and million were purchased and million and million of marketable securities were sold in fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  no marketable securities were purchased and million of marketable securities were sold 
mobius made an investment of  in home account network during fiscal this investment is disclosed in detail in a separate section of management s discussion and analysis and in note of the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  in fiscal  primarily due to the sale of mobius s common stock through the employee stock purchase plan  offset by the cash used to repurchase mobius s common stock 
in fiscal  net cash used in financing activities was million  primarily due to cash used to repurchase mobius s common stock pursuant to mobius s stock repurchase program  offset by cash received for employee stock purchases and stock option exercises 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of  was due to cash received from the exercise of stock options and sales of mobius s common stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
the company s material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts consist of its operating leases for its office facilities 
these leases expire on various dates through fiscal and provide for additional payments relating to utility costs 
as of june   the future minimum lease payments for these operating leases is as follows in thousands operating leases year ended june   june   june   june   june   thereafter  total minimum lease payments  in compliance with the lease of the company s corporate headquarters in rye  ny  the landlord holds a letter of credit issued by silicon valley bank for  this letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit 
the company believes that its existing cash balances and cash flows expected from future operations will be sufficient to meet the company s capital requirements for at least months 
as discussed in the section entitled  software license installments receivable below  the company has entered into a significant number of license contracts having extended payment terms 
if the level of software license revenues financed by installments receivable continues at the current rate  the company s cash position is likely to be adversely affected 
on october  the closing date  the company  through a wholly owned subsidiary  acquired technology the contenuity software and certain other assets of cytura  a privately held company  for an aggregate of approximately million in cash  which was paid from the company s existing cash balances 
in addition  the company assumed capital lease obligations of  and incurred acquisition related expenses of  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the company is obligated to pay cytura up to an additional  within days of the first anniversary of the transaction if the average closing price of the common stock of mobius equals or exceeds a specified amount during any day period in the thirteen months following the closing date 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the average closing price of the company s common stock for a day period exceeded specified amounts set forth in the agreement 
as a result  mobius will be required to make an additional payment of  to cytura in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded goodwill and a payable to cytura of  reflecting the requirement to pay this amount 
the company continues to evaluate potential acquisition candidates whose products or technology would enhance mobius s strategic market position 
accounts receivable reserves accounts receivable reserves are primarily calculated by identifying problem accounts and in recognition that some customers decide to cancel or reduce the number of products covered by maintenance arrangements upon their anniversary but do not always notify mobius in sufficient time to prevent some portion of the annual maintenance billings from being recognized 
mobius also maintains a reserve to absorb losses based upon historical experience that may result from current receivables 
mobius specifically identifies problem accounts based on the age of the receivable and through discussions with the customer and mobius s sales representatives 
based on the specific account information and the historical relationship or actual losses to revenues and receivable balances  mobius exercises its judgment as to what portion of the accounts receivable balance requires a reserve 
as of june  and june   approximately and  respectively  of the total accounts receivable reserve balances were related to specific accounts 
to the extent that an account for which a specific reserve was provided is subsequently collected  mobius reduces the reserves in the period of collection 
accounts receivable reserves were million and  at june  and june   respectively 
software license installments receivable as of june   software license installments amounted to million  an increase of compared with the june  balance of million 
the increase reflects a significant increase in licenses having extended payment terms  including licenses of viewdirect tcm products that the company began to market in fiscal under the term solution packs 
solution packs are viewdirect tcm product bundles that offer customers technology solutions through application based licensing with  generally  license terms of five years 
the company believes the practice of providing financing enhances our competitive position 
since payments are made over multiple reporting periods  software license installments receivable will fluctuate with the amount of license revenue sold on an installment basis 
mobius provides financing to customers that meet our specified standards of creditworthiness 
software license installments are discounted at a market rate of interest at the date the software license contract revenue is recognized 
the discount is amortized to interest income using the interest method over the term of the financing 
the company determines the reserve for software license installments based upon customer specific information  including a credit review of the customer  historical write off experience  the ability of the company to enforce original payment terms and current economic conditions 
no single customer has a balance in excess of of total software license installments  and of the total is comprised of customers with balances under  as of june  and  software license installments reserves were  and  respectively 
deferred revenues deferred revenues consist primarily of the unearned portion of maintenance billings  unbundled maintenance and license contracts 
current and non current deferred revenues increased from million at june  to million at june  deferred revenues can fluctuate due to the timing of annual maintenance billings  increases or decreases in current license revenues and increases or decreases in license contracts that include more than one year of maintenance 
as of june   current deferred revenues totaled million and non current deferred revenues totaled million 
it is anticipated that current deferred revenues of million will be recognized as revenues within the next twelve months 
other matters infopac tapesaver in january  the company sold the infopac tapesaver product to a third party for approximately million payable over a five year period 
for the year ended june   the company recognized  of tapesaver license revenue 
as the buyer has been delinquent on these payments since june  no license revenue relating to this transaction was recognized in fiscal and mobius commenced arbitration proceedings against the buyer to enforce the payment terms in the sales agreement 
on march   the arbitrator issued an award in mobius s favor against the buyer and its president in the amount of  which represented the amount past due under such agreement 
the arbitrator also directed the buyer and its president to pay mobius  per month from march  through december  and to pay mobius s share of the arbitration expenses 
in april  mobius commenced an action against the buyer and its president in the united states district court for the southern district of new york to confirm the arbitration award 
the court entered an order confirming the award on september  the company has docketed the judgment in california and is currently pursuing actions to enforce the judgment 
to date  the company has not recorded any amounts due in connection with the arbitration 
as a result of the uncertainty of collection  any amounts ultimately recorded will be accounted for on the cash basis 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires more prominent and frequent disclosures about the effects of stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december  mobius continues to apply the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no

in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  related to the timing of revenue recognition for arrangements in which goods or services or both are delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement 
the eitf requires that when the deliverables included in this type of arrangement meet certain criteria they should be accounted for separately as separate units of accounting 
this may result in a difference in the timing of revenue recognition but will not result in a change in the total amount of revenue recognized in a bundled sales arrangement 
the allocation of revenue to the separate deliverables is based on the relative fair value of each item 
if the fair value is not available for the delivered items then the residual method must be used 
this method requires that the amount allocated to the undelivered items in the arrangement is their full fair value 
this would result in the discount  if any  being allocated to the delivered items 
this consensus is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  eitf will not have an impact upon initial adoption and is not expected to have a material impact to mobius s ongoing results of operations  financial position and cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk mobius s investment portfolio is subject to interest rate sensitivity 
the primary objective of mobius s investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing the interest income  without significantly increasing risk 
some of the marketable securities in which mobius invested in the past may have been subject to market rate interest risk  where a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the market value of the security to fluctuate 
for example  if mobius holds a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rates and the prevailing interest rates later rise  the market value of the security will probably decline 
as of june   mobius held no marketable securities 
mobius may be subject to foreign currency fluctuations in relation to accounts receivable and accounts payable that may be denominated in a foreign currency other than the functional currency in certain international jurisdictions 
to the extent that such foreign currency transactions are negatively or positively affected by foreign currency fluctuations  foreign currency transaction losses or gains would be recognized 
mobius does not use derivative foreign exchange financial investments
