item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we use our advanced design  engineering and manufacturing abilities to produce microelectronic and testing solutions 
our products are used in the aerospace  defense  fiber optic  wireless and satellite communications markets 
we also design and manufacture motion control systems and shock and vibration isolation systems which are used for commercial  industrial and defense applications 
our operations are grouped into three segments microelectronic solutions test solutions isolator products our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of aeroflex incorporated and all of our subsidiaries 
in october  we merged with altair aerospace corporation 
this transaction was accounted for as a pooling of interests and  accordingly  for all periods prior to the business combination  our historical consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the accounts and results of operations of altair 
all of our subsidiaries are wholly owned 
our microelectronic solutions segment has been designing  manufacturing and selling state of the art microelectronics for the electronics industry since in january  we acquired substantially all of the net operating assets of the microelectronics division of marconi circuit technology corporation  which manufactures a wide variety of microelectronic assemblies 
in march  we acquired mic technology corporation now aeroflex pearl river  inc which designs  develops  manufactures and markets microelectronic products in the form of passive thin film circuits and interconnects

our test solutions segment consists of two divisions instruments and motion control products  including the following product lines comstron  a leader in radio frequency and microwave technology used in the manufacture of fast switching frequency signal generators and components  which we acquired in november comstron is currently an operating division of aeroflex plainview  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
lintek now aeroflex powell  inc  a leader in high speed instrumentation antenna measurement systems  radar systems and satellite test systems  which we acquired in january europtest  sa france  which we acquired in september europtest develops and sells specialized software driven test equipment used primarily in cellular  satellite and other communications applications 
altair  which we merged with in october in a pooling of interests business combination 
altair merged into aeroflex powell  inc designs and develops advanced object oriented control systems software based upon a proprietary software engine 
rdl  which we acquired in october rdl merged into aeroflex plainview  inc designs  develops and manufactures advanced commercial communications test and measurement products and defense subsystems 
ifr  which we acquired in may ifr now aeroflex wichita  inc designs and manufactures advanced test solutions for communications  avionics and general test and measurement applications 
our motion control products division has been engaged in the development and manufacture of electro optical scanning devices used in infra red night vision systems since additionally  it is engaged in the design  development and production of stabilization tracking devices and systems and magnetic motors used in satellites and other high reliability applications 
our isolator products segment has been designing  developing  manufacturing and selling severe service shock and vibration isolation systems since these devices are primarily used in defense applications 
in october  we acquired vibration mountings controls  inc  which manufactures a line of off the shelf rubber and spring shock  vibration and structure borne noise control devices used in commercial and industrial applications 
in december  we acquired the operating assets of korfund dynamics corporation  a manufacturer of an industrial line of heavy duty spring and rubber shock mounts 
in december  our board of directors approved a formal plan to discontinue our fiber optic lithium niobate modulator operation which was acquired in march the plan called for an immediate cessation of operations and disposal of existing assets 
the abandonment of the operation resulted in a charge of million million  net of tax in the quarter ended december  the charge included a cash requirement of million  primarily for equipment leases and payroll costs  and a non cash charge of million  primarily for the write off of owned equipment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the abandonment has been reported as a discontinued operation and  accordingly  losses from operations and the loss on abandonment have been reported separately from continuing operations 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for arrangements other than certain long term contracts  revenue including shipping and handling fees is recognized when products are shipped and title is passed to the customer 
revenues associated with certain long term contracts are recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under sop  we use the percentage of completion method  whereby revenues and associated costs are recognized as work on a contract progresses 
we measure the extent of progress toward completion generally based upon one of the following based upon an assessment of which method most closely aligns to the underlying earnings process i the units of delivery method  ii the cost to cost method  using the ratio of contract costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs at contract completion based upon engineering and production estimates  or iii the achievement of contractual milestones 
provisions for anticipated losses or revisions in estimated profits on contracts in process are recorded in the period in which such anticipated losses or revisions become evident 
approximately of our sales for fiscal  of our sales for fiscal and of our sales for fiscal were to agencies of the united states government or to prime defense contractors or subcontractors of the united states government 
our government contracts have been awarded either on a bid basis or after negotiation 
our government contracts are primarily fixed price contracts  although we also have or had government contracts providing for cost plus fixed fee 
our defense contracts have customary provisions for termination at the convenience of the government without cause 
in the event of such termination  we are entitled to reimbursement for our costs and to receive a reasonable profit  if any  on the work done prior to termination 
our product development efforts primarily involve engineering and design relating to developing new products improving existing products adapting existing products to new applications developing prototype components to bid on specific programs some of our development efforts are reimbursed under contractual arrangements 
product development and similar costs which we cannot recover under contractual arrangements are expensed in the period incurred 
statement of operations the following table sets forth our net sales and operating income loss by business segment for the periods indicated 
the special charges represent the write offs of in process research and development acquired in connection with the purchases of businesses of million and million in the years ended june  and  respectively  and restructuring charges of million in the year ended june  years ended june  in thousands net sales microelectronic solutions    test solutions    isolator products    net sales    operating income loss microelectronic solutions    test solutions   isolator products  general corporate expenses    special charges   operating income loss   the following table sets forth certain items from our statement of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales in the microelectronic solutions segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to an increase in sales volume of our specialty semiconductor products of million  partially offset by a decrease in sales volume of thin film interconnects of million 
net sales in the test solutions segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of ifr systems  inc ifr in fiscal versus only weeks in fiscal net sales in the isolator products segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to increased sales volume in the commercial and industrial product lines 
gross profit 
cost of sales includes materials  direct labor and overhead expenses such as engineering labor  fringe benefits  allocable occupancy costs  depreciation and manufacturing supplies 
gross profit increased to million including a  charge related to the bankruptcy of space systems loral of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal excluding  of restructuring charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of ifr for a full year in fiscal compared with only six weeks in fiscal selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs include office and management salaries  fringe benefits and commissions 
selling  general and administrative costs increased to million of net sales in fiscal including a  charge related to the loral bankruptcy from million of net sales in fiscal excluding million of restructuring charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase was primarily due to higher corporate expenses and the inclusion of ifr for the entire year in fiscal compared with only six weeks in fiscal research and development costs 
research and development costs include material  engineering labor and allocated overhead 
our self funded research and development costs increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal the increase was primarily due to ifr s full year expenses in fiscal compared with only six weeks in fiscal acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the fiscal acquisition of ifr  we allocated million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the projects completion percentage 
at the acquisition date  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we expensed these costs as of the acquisition date 
other expense income 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other income of  in fiscal consists primarily of  of interest income  partially offset by  in realized foreign currency transaction losses 
other income of million in fiscal consists primarily of million of interest income offset by  of realized foreign currency transaction losses and a  decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
interest income decreased primarily due to lower levels of cash and cash equivalents  which were used to acquire ifr  and lower market interest rates 
provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision was million an effective income tax rate of in fiscal and the income tax provision was  an effective income tax rate of in fiscal the income tax provisions for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to in process r d  foreign  state and local income taxes and research and development credits 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations for the year ended june  was million or 
per diluted share which is net of a million charge  net of tax or 
per diluted share related to the loral bankruptcy versus income from continuing operations of  or 
per diluted share in fiscal income from continuing operations included a million charge million  net of tax or 
per diluted share  for restructuring charges related to the consolidation of certain operations and a million charge million  net of tax or 
per diluted share  for in process research and development related to the acquisition of ifr systems  inc fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales in the microelectronic solutions segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to decreased sales volume in microelectronic modules and thin film interconnects as a result of the slowdown of the fiber optics market 
net sales in the test solutions segment increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the acquisition of ifr in may and an increase in sales of satellite test systems partially offset by a decline in sales of our rdl product line 
net sales in the isolator products segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due to reduced sales volume in the commercial and industrial product lines 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million of net sales in fiscal excluding  of restructuring charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements from million of net sales in fiscal the decreases were primarily a result of the decreased sales volume and the fixed nature of certain labor and overhead costs in the microelectronic solutions segment 
selling  general and administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased to million of net sales in fiscal excluding million of restructuring charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements from million of net sales in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower corporate expenses and decreased expenses in the microelectronic solutions segment which were partially offset by the addition of the expenses of ifr 
research and development costs 
our self funded research and development costs increased to million of net sales in fiscal from million of net sales in fiscal the increase was primarily due to utmc s efforts toward the development of new integrated circuits and the additional expenses of ifr 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of ifr  we allocated million of the purchase price to incomplete research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on future cash flows that have been adjusted by the projects completion percentage 
at the acquisition date  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  we expensed these costs as of the acquisition date 
the value assigned to these assets was determined by identifying significant research projects for which technological feasibility had not been established 
at the acquisition date  ifr was conducting design  development  engineering and testing activities associated with the completion of new technologies for its radio test set and signal sources product lines 
the projects under development at the valuation date represent technologies which are expected to address emerging market demands in the communications test industry 
we intend to continue with these development efforts and  if successfully completed  release the products to market 
at its acquisition date  ifr expected to spend approximately million to complete all phases of the research and development  with anticipated completion dates ranging from to months from that date 
we determined the value assigned to purchased in process technology by estimating the contribution of the purchased in process technology in developing a commercially viable product  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the expected sales of such a product  and discounting the net cash flows to their present value using an appropriate discount rate 
revenue growth rates for the acquired company were estimated based on a detailed forecast  as well as discussions with the finance  marketing and engineering personnel of ifr 
allocation of total projected revenues to in process research and development was based on discussions with ifr s management 
selling  general and administrative expenses and profitability estimates were determined based on forecasts as well as an analysis of comparable companies margin expectations 
the projections utilized in the transaction pricing and purchase price allocation exclude the potential synergetic benefits related specifically to our ownership 
due to the stage of the development and reliance on future  unproven products and technologies  the nature of the forecast and the risks associated with the projected growth and profitability of the development projects  a discount rate of to was used to discount cash flows from the in process technology 
the discount rate was commensurate with ifr s market position  the uncertainties in the economic estimates described above  the inherent uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology  the useful lives of such technology  the profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty related to technological advances that could render development stage technologies obsolete 
we believe that the foregoing assumptions used in the forecasts were reasonable at the time of the acquisition 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate sales  development costs or profitability  or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
remaining development efforts for ifr s research and development included various phases of design  development and testing 
funding for such projects is expected to come primarily from internally generated sources 
as evidenced by the continued support of the development of ifr s projects  we believe we have a reasonable chance of successfully completing the research and development programs 
however  as with all of our technology development  there is risk associated with the completion of the research and development projects  and there is no assurance that technological or commercial success will be achieved 
if the development of these in process research and development projects is unsuccessful  our sales and profitability may be adversely affected in future periods 
commercial results are also subject to certain market events and risks  which are beyond our control  such as trends in technology  changes in government regulation  market size and growth  and product introduction or other actions by competitors 
restructuring charges 
we initiated strategic plans to consolidate three of our manufacturing operations to take advantage of excess manufacturing capacity in certain of our facilities and reduce operating costs 
in connection with this restructuring  we recorded a charge of million in the fiscal year ended june  the restructuring charge includes  of charges for the impairment of intangibles  million for the write off of excess equipment and leasehold improvements  million for workforce reductions  million for buyouts of certain equipment and facility leases   for the write off of inventory and  relating to facility closing and clean up 
the restructuring charges were allocated million to the microelectronics solutions segment and million to the test solutions segment 
other expense income 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to reduced levels of borrowings throughout most of other income of million in fiscal consists primarily of million of interest income offset by  of realized foreign currency transaction losses and a  decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
other income of million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of interest income offset by a  decrease in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
interest income decreased primarily due to lower interest rates and decreased levels of cash  cash equivalants and marketable securities as a result of the use of approximately million in cash to acquire ifr in may provision for income taxes 
the income tax provision was  an effective income tax rate of in fiscal and the income tax provision was million an effective income tax rate of in fiscal the income tax provisions for the two periods differed from the amount computed by applying the us federal income tax rate to income before income taxes primarily due to non deductible charges for acquired in process r d and amortization of goodwill  state and local income taxes and research and development credits 
income from continuing operations 
on a us gaap basis  income from continuing operations for the year ended june  was  or 
per diluted share versus million or 
per diluted share 
income from continuing operations for the year ended june  includes a restructuring charge of million million  net of tax or 
per diluted share and a charge of million million  net of tax or 
per diluted share for in process research and development 
income from continuing operations for the year ended june  includes a charge for in process research and development of million million  net of tax or 
per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources on february   we executed an amended and restated revolving credit and security agreement with two banks which replaced a previous loan agreement 
the amended and restated loan agreement increased the line of credit to million through february  continues the mortgage on our plainview property for million and is secured by the pledge of the stock of certain of our subsidiaries 
the interest rate on revolving credit borrowings under this agreement is at various rates depending upon certain financial ratios  with the current rate substantially equivalent to prime at june  
the mortgage is payable in monthly installments of approximately  through march and a balloon payment of million in april we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the outstanding amount under the mortgage agreement at approximately in order to reduce the interest rate risk associated with these borrowings 
the terms of the loan agreement require compliance with certain covenants including minimum consolidated tangible net worth and pretax earnings  maintenance of certain financial ratios  limitations on indebtedness and prohibition of the payment of cash dividends 
we are currently in full compliance with all of the covenants contained in our loan agreement 
in connection with the purchase of certain materials for use in manufacturing  we have a letter of credit of million 
in fiscal  we acquired the outstanding stock of ifr 
the purchase price was approximately million of which million was used to fully satisfy ifr s bank indebtedness 
the balance was used to purchase ifr s outstanding shares and for various acquisition related costs 
the purchase price was paid from available cash and marketable securities 
ifr designs and manufactures advanced test solutions for communications  avionics and general test and measurement applications 
the acquired company s net sales were approximately million for the year ended march  during fiscal  we announced certain strategic consolidations of our manufacturing operations 
the total restructuring charges were million with a cash cost of million 
these restructurings are substantially complete and are expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately million and result in annual cash savings of approximately million 
the restructuring charges included the elimination of excess equipment capacity primarily in the microelectronic solutions segment  severance and other employee related expenses 
in fiscal  our operations provided cash of million primarily from our continued profitability  excluding non cash charges of depreciation and amortization 
in fiscal  our investing activities used cash of million including million of capital expenditures 
in fiscal  our financing activities used cash of consisting of million for payments of debt partially offset by  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
on september   we acquired mce technologies  inc mce for approximately million shares of common stock and satisfied mce obligations of an aggregate million which was funded by cash on hand and available credit lines 
on july   we acquired racal instruments wireless solutions group wsg for cash of million and a deferred payment of up to million in either cash or aeroflex common stock  at our option  depending on wsg achieving certain performance goals for the year ending july  this acquisition was funded with available cash on hand 
we believe that existing cash and unused lines of credit coupled with internally generated funds will be sufficient for our working capital requirements  capital expenditure needs and the servicing of our debt for the foreseeable future 
our cash and lines of credit are available to fund acquisitions and other potential large cash needs that may arise 
at june   our available unused line of credit was million after consideration of letters of credit 
we used million of this line to fund the acquisition of mce on september  the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt and operating leases as of june  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt      operating leases      total      the operating lease commitments shown in the above table have not been reduced by future minimum sub lease rentals of million 
in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
none of these obligations are individually significant 
we do not expect that these commitments as of june  will materially adversely affect our liquidity 
legal proceedings we are involved in various routine legal matters 
we believe the outcome of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we are undergoing routine audits by various taxing authorities of our federal and state income tax returns covering periods from to we believe that the probable outcome of these various audits should not materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
backlog our backlog of orders was million at june  and million at june  accounting policies involving significant estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the recognition of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require us to make estimates and assumptions based on the circumstances  information available and our experience and judgment 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  our financial statements could be materially impacted 
revenue and cost recognition under long term contracts we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for arrangements other than certain long term contracts  revenue including shipping and handling fees is recognized when products are shipped and title is passed to the customer 
revenues associated with certain long term contracts are recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
under sop  we use the percentage of completion method  whereby revenues and associated costs are recognized as work on a contract progresses 
we measure the extent of progress toward completion generally based upon one of the following based upon an assessment of which method most closely aligns to the underlying earnings process i the units of delivery method  ii the cost to cost method  using the ratio of contract costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs at contract completion based upon engineering and production estimates  or iii the achievement of contractual milestones 
provisions for anticipated losses or revisions in estimated profits on contracts in process are recorded in the period in which such anticipated losses or revisions become evident 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
inventory levels are maintained in relation to the expected sales volume 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of our inventory 
numerous analyses are applied including lower of cost or market analysis  forecasted sales requirements and forecasted warranty requirements 
after taking these and other factors into consideration  such as technological changes  age and physical condition  appropriate adjustments are recorded to the inventory balance 
if actual conditions differ from our expectations  then inventory balances may be over or under valued  which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
recoverability of long lived and intangible assets property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the life of the lease or the estimated life of the asset  whichever is shorter 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business model can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
to the extent the estimated useful lives are incorrect  the value of these assets may be over or under stated  which in turn could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
long lived assets other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any such asset may be impaired 
we evaluate the recoverability of such assets by estimating future cash flows 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent of the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over the discounted cash flow 
sfas no 
requires that we perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired on an annual basis unless events or circumstances warrant a more frequent assessment 
the impairment assessment involves  among other things  an estimation of the fair value of each of our reporting units as defined in sfas no 

such estimations are inherently subjective  and subject to change in future periods 
if the impairment review of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets differ significantly from actual results  it could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
restructuring charges when circumstances warrant a restructuring charge  we estimate and record all appropriate expenses 
these expenses include severance  retention bonuses  fringe benefits  asset impairment  buyout of leases and inventory write downs 
to the extent that our estimates differ from actual expenses  there could be significant additional expenses or reversals of previously recorded charges in the future 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
if this assumption changes in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly 
seasonality although our business is not affected by seasonality  historically our revenues and earnings increase sequentially from quarter to quarter within a fiscal year  but the first quarter is typically less than the previous year s fourth quarter 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which was effective january  sfas no 
provides that an exit cost liability should not always be recorded at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  but instead should be recorded when the obligation is incurred 
an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
such adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value regardless of the probability of the loss 
fin has been adopted prospectively by us as of january  the adoption resulted in additional disclosure in the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf issue is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently analyzing the impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial statements

accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in both annual and interim financial statements 
we have adopted the disclosure portion of this statement for the fiscal year ended june  the adoption did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas no 
the statement is effective with certain exceptions for contracts entered into or modified after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer clarifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
it is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  applicability of aicpa statement of position sop to non software deliverables eitf 
the consensus was reached that sop is applicable to non software deliverables if they are included in an arrangement that contains software that is essential to the non software deliverables functionality 
this consensus is to be applied to fiscal periods beginning after august  we are currently analyzing the impact of this consensus on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this annual report  including without limitation statements under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding our financial position  business strategy and plans and objectives of our management for future operations  are forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report  words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend and similar expressions  as they relate to us or our management  identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are based on the current beliefs of our management  as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to our management 
actual results could differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  competitive factors and pricing pressures  the integration of the business of each of mce technologies and of the racal instruments wireless solutions group with aeroflex  changes in legal and regulatory requirements  technological change or difficulties  product development risks  commercialization difficulties and general economic conditions 
such statements reflect our current views with respect to the future and are subject to these and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions relating to aeroflex s financial condition  results of operations  growth strategy and liquidity 
aeroflex does not undertake any obligation to update such forward looking statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and to foreign currency exchange rates 
most of our debt is at fixed rates of interest or at a variable rate with an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts the variable rate debt into fixed rate debt 
therefore  if market interest rates increase by from levels at june   the effect on our net income would be a reduction of approximately  per year 
most of our invested cash and cash equivalents are at variable rates of interest 
if market interest rates decrease by percent from levels at june   the effect on our net income would be approximately  if foreign currency exchange rates primarily the british pound and the euro change by from levels at june   the effect on our other comprehensive income would be approximately million
