item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have two reportable business segments equity markets and asset management 
within equity markets  we are a leading execution specialist making markets in cash equities and in options on individual equities and equity indices 
additionally  we maintain an asset management business for institutions and high net worth individuals 
market and economic conditions in in the us  market and economic conditions remained difficult during investors continued to be concerned with weak corporate earnings and increased uncertainty about the strength and pace of the domestic economic recovery 
in addition  investor confidence weakened due to increased concerns regarding the quality of corporate financial reporting and accounting practices  corporate governance  unethical or illegal corporate practices and several significant corporate bankruptcies 
these developments  coupled with increased geopolitical unrest  created difficult conditions in the us financial markets  resulting in a decline in the us equity markets for a third consecutive year 
during  the nasdaq composite index was down from december  similarly  the djia and the s p were down and  respectively  from december  the securities and exchange commission the sec also enacted certain laws including  among other things  requiring chief executive officers and chief financial officers of public companies to certify the accuracy of certain financial reports and other sec filings 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of was enacted  which included broad regulation affecting public companies with provisions covering corporate governance and management  new disclosure requirements  oversight of the accounting profession and auditor independence 
economic and market conditions also were similarly difficult in europe and japan during these conditions adversely affected the company s results of operations 
it currently is uncertain when these market and economic conditions will improve 
certain factors affecting results of operations our results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations  regulatory changes and by economic factors 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in operating results due to a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  the value of our securities positions and 
table of contents our ability to manage the risks attendant thereto  the volume of our market making activities  the dollar value of securities traded  volatility in the securities markets  the performance of our international businesses  our ability to manage personnel  overhead and other expenses  including our occupancy expenses on our office leases  the strength of our client relationships  the amount of revenue derived from limit orders as a percentage of net trading revenues  the amount of  and volatility in  the results of our statistical arbitrage and program trading portfolios  changes in payments for order flow and clearing costs  the addition or loss of executive management and sales  trading and technology professionals  legislative  legal and regulatory changes  regulatory matters  geopolitical risk  the amount and timing of capital expenditures and divestitures  the incurrence of costs associated with acquisitions and dispositions  investor sentiment  the level of assets under management  technological changes and events  seasonality  competition and market and economic conditions 
such factors may also have an impact on our ability to achieve our strategic objectives  including  without limitation to  increases in our market share and revenue capture in our equity markets segment and increases in our fund returns and assets under management in our asset management segment 
if demand for our equity markets segment s services declines and we are unable to adjust our cost structure on a timely basis  our operating results and strategic objectives could be materially and adversely affected 
additionally  our operations could be affected by the activity of certain exchanges 
poor results and low activity at exchanges could materially and adversely affect our operating results and lead to a writedown of certain intangible assets 
as a result of the foregoing factors  period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily meaningful and such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
there also can be no assurance that we will be able to return to the rates of revenue growth that we have experienced in the past  that we will be able to improve our operating results or that we will be able to regain our profitability levels on an annual and or quarterly basis 
trends we believe that our business is currently impacted by the following trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
first  the continuing effects of decimalization and other market structure changes  competition and market conditions have resulted in a significant decline in revenue capture per share in our cash equities market making operations and revenue capture per contract in our options market making operations 
for example  average revenue capture per share has fallen from in to in average revenue capture per contract has similarly fallen from in to in average revenue capture per share represents the total net trading revenue from our cash equities market making operations divided by the volume of us equity shares traded 
average revenue capture per contract reflects the total net trading revenue plus net interest income from our options market making and specialist operations divided by the volume of our us option contracts traded 
second  decimalization and other market structure changes  competition and market conditions have triggered an industry shift from market makers trading otc securities solely as principal to executing trades on a riskless principal or agency basis with institutions paying commission equivalents or commissions  respectively  as declining spreads reduce profits for principal equity trading firms and as firms become more risk averse in their capital commitments 
currently  we execute the majority of our institutional client orders on a riskless principal or agency basis  charging commission equivalents or commissions  and we execute the majority of our broker dealer client orders as principal 
third  market makers have reduced their payment for order flow rates as average revenue capture per share and average revenue capture per contract have fallen 
we have changed our payment for order flow rates several times in and in addition  we also have recently expanded our program of charging execution fees to certain of our broker dealer clients for certain order flow 
fourth  electronic communication networks ecn s and other alternative trading systems  that can charge access fees to counterparties who access their liquidity where market makers cannot  now account for a significant amount of nasdaq trading volume 
also  direct access trading solutions and application service providers are growing in popularity 
the introduction of supermontage by nasdaq and the increase in trading of nasdaq listed securities on other exchanges has increased market fragmentation  resulting in increased execution expenses  fragmented liquidity pools and different market centers using different sets of regulatory rules and regulations 
fifth  the effects of decimalization and market conditions 
table of contents have resulted in consolidation in the equities and options market making industries 
for example  in  several equity market makers withdrew from providing market making services or scaled back the number of stocks in which they make markets 
in the options area  there also was significant consolidation in revenues our revenues consist principally of net trading revenue from us securities market making activities 
net trading revenue  which consists of trading gains net of trading losses and commission equivalents  is primarily affected by changes in us equity trade and share volumes and us option contract volumes  our average revenue capture per share and per contract  dollar value of equities and options traded  our ability to derive trading gains by taking proprietary positions  changes in our execution standards  volatility in the marketplace  our mix of broker dealer and institutional clients and by regulatory changes and evolving industry customs and practices 
securities transactions with clients are executed as principal  riskless principal or agent 
profits and losses on principal transactions and commission equivalents on riskless principal transactions are included within net trading revenue  and commissions earned on agency transactions are included within commissions and fees 
we execute the majority of our institutional client orders on a riskless principal or agency basis  generating commission equivalents or commissions 
we execute the majority of our broker dealer client orders as principal 
we also receive fees for providing certain information to market data providers and for directing trades to certain destinations for execution

asset management fees represent fees earned for sponsoring and managing the investment fund managed by deephaven capital management llc deephaven the deephaven fund 
asset management fees are primarily affected by the rates of return earned on the deephaven fund and changes in the amount of assets under management

the company s clearing agreements call for payment or receipt of interest income  net of transaction related interest charged by clearing brokers for facilitating the settlement and financing of securities transactions 
net interest is primarily affected by interest rates  the changes in cash balances held at banks and clearing brokers and our level of securities positions in which we are long compared to our securities positions in which we are short 
investment income and other income primarily represents income earned  net of losses  related to our strategic investments and our investment in the deephaven fund 
investment income and other income are primarily affected by the rates of return earned by the deephaven fund as well as the performance and activity of our strategic investments 
expenses our operating expenses largely consist of employee compensation and benefits  payments for order flow and execution and clearance fees 
employee compensation and benefits expense fluctuates  for the most part  based on changes in net trading revenue  our profitability and our number of employees 
payments for order flow fluctuate based on us equity share and option volume  the mix of market orders and limit orders  the mix of orders received from broker dealers and institutions who accept payments for order flow and changes in our payment for order flow policy 
execution and clearance fees primarily fluctuate based on changes in equity trade and share volume  option contract volume  clearance fees charged by clearing brokers and fees paid to access ecns and exchanges 

table of contents employee compensation and benefits expense primarily consists of salaries and wages paid to all employees and profitability based compensation  which includes compensation paid to market making and sales personnel primarily based on their individual and overall performance and incentive compensation paid to other employees based on our overall profitability 
compensation for employees engaged in sales activities is determined primarily based on a percentage of their gross revenues net of expenses including payments for order flow  execution and clearance costs and overhead allocations net profitability 
through october  compensation for employees engaged in cash equities market making activities was determined primarily based on a percentage of net profitability 
effective november  the compensation model for our cash equities market making personnel changed to a salary and discretionary bonus 
the compensation model for our options market making personnel was based on a salary and discretionary bonus throughout execution and clearance fees primarily represent clearance fees paid to clearing brokers for cash equities and options transactions  transaction fees paid to nasdaq  option exchange fees  payments made to third parties for exchange seat leases  execution fees paid to third parties  primarily for executing trades in listed securities on the nyse and amex  and for executing orders through ecns 
payments for order flow represent payments to certain broker dealers and institutional clients  in the normal course of business  for directing their order flow in us cash equities and us option contracts to us 
payments for order flow change as we modify our payment rates and as our percentage of clients whose policy is not to accept payments for order flow varies 
communications and data processing expense primarily consists of costs for obtaining market data  telecommunications services and systems maintenance 
depreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of fixed assets and leasehold improvements and the amortization of intangible assets with finite lives primarily related to our purchases of various options related specialist posts 
in accordance with sfas no 
 as of january   goodwill is no longer being amortized

average revenue capture per share has continued to be adversely impacted by a reduction in spreads due to decimalization and the resulting one penny minimum price spread  and the reduction in the average market price of shares traded 
this decrease in net trading revenues due to the reduction of average revenue capture was offset  in part  by a increase in us equity share volume

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market making and trading activities expose our capital to significant risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to  absolute and relative price movements  price volatility and changes in liquidity  over which we have virtually no control 
we employ automated proprietary trading and position management systems that provide real time  on line position management and inventory control 
we monitor our risks by reviewing trading positions and their appropriate risk measures 
we have established a system whereby transactions are monitored by senior management on a real time basis as are individual and aggregate dollar and inventory position totals and real time profits and losses 
the management of trading positions is enhanced by review of mark to market valuations and position summaries on a daily basis 
in the normal course of our equities market making business  we maintain inventories of exchange listed and otc equity securities 
the fair value of these securities at december  and was million and million  respectively  in long positions and million and million  respectively  in short positions 
additionally  at december   we had million in long positions and million in short 
table of contents positions in accounts managed by deephaven 
the potential change in fair value  using a hypothetical decline in prices  is estimated to be a million loss and a million loss as of december  and  respectively  due to the offset of losses in long positions with gains in short positions 
the following table illustrates  for the period indicated  our average  highest and lowest month end inventory at market value based on both the aggregate and the net of the long and short positions of trading securities from our cash equities business 
aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions aggregate of long and short positions net of long and short positions average month end highest month end lowest month end in the normal course of our options business  we maintain inventories of options  futures and equities 
our main exposure is from equity price and volatility risk 
we manage these exposures by constantly monitoring and diversifying our exposures and position sizes and establishing offsetting hedges 
our market making staff and trading room managers continuously manage our positions and our risk exposures 
our systems incorporate trades and update our risk profile using options pricing models on a real time basis 
our proprietary options risk management system allows us to stress test our portfolio on a real time basis 
on a timely basis  risk reports are distributed to senior management and the firm s risk managers who incorporate this information in our market making decisions 
these reports identify potential exposures with respect to options and futures on individual securities and index contracts  organized in different ways such as industry sectors  under extreme price and volatility movements 
at december   movements in volatility and stock prices on our entire equity options and equity index options portfolios  which contain the majority of our market risk  would have resulted in approximately the following gains losses in our options market making portfolio change in stock prices none change in volatility million million million none million million million million million this stress analysis covers positions in options and futures  underlying securities and related hedges 
the changes in stock prices and volatility in the charts above make the assumption of a universal movement in all of our underlying positions 
the analysis also includes a number of estimates that we believe to be reasonable  however  we cannot assure that they will produce an accurate measure of future risk 
as of december   we had million invested in the deephaven fund  which is managed by deephaven 
the general objective of market neutral strategies is to capture mispricings or spreads between related capital instruments 
the deephaven fund uses the following strategies domestic convertible trading  international convertible trading  statistical arbitrage trading  risk arbitrage trading  volatility trading and investing in private placement transactions in public companies 
because the basis of the deephaven fund s strategy is capturing mispricings or spreads between related instruments  rather than attempting to predict or follow absolute price movements  the performance of the deephaven fund is expected to be substantially non correlated with the general debt and equity markets  as well as with a number of other non traditional investment strategies 
however  there will be unhedged credit risk in the convertible portfolio and that part of the portfolio will have some correlation to credit spreads 
market neutral trading involves substantial risks 
disruptions in historical pricing relationships as occurred during the period of august october can result in significant losses 
in addition  market neutral strategies are subject to the risk of a tightening of dealer credit  forcing 
table of contents premature liquidation of positions 
the deephaven fund also utilizes leverage  to the extent available and deemed by deephaven to be consistent with fund s risk reward objectives  in an attempt to increase returns while maintaining strict risk controls 
similar to our equity markets segment  the deephaven fund employs automated proprietary trading and position management systems that provide on line position management and inventory control 
we monitor our risks by reviewing trading positions and their appropriate risk measures 
we have established a system whereby transactions are monitored by senior management  as are individual and aggregate dollar and inventory position totals and profits and losses by strategy 
the management of trading positions is enhanced by review of mark to market valuations and position summaries on a daily basis 
there can be no assurances that the deephaven fund s strategy will be successful in achieving either its risk control or its profit objectives 
for working capital purposes  we invest in money market funds  commercial paper  government securities or maintain interest bearing balances in our trading accounts with clearing brokers  which are classified as cash and cash equivalents and receivable from clearing brokers  respectively  in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
these other amounts do not have maturity dates or present a material market risk  as the balances are short term in nature and subject to daily repricing 
our cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies are subject to the exposure of foreign currency fluctuations 
these balances are monitored daily  and are not material to the company s overall cash position
