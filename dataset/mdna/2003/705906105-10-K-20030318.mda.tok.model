item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data included as item of this annual report on form k and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included as item of this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements including statements using terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  intends  anticipates  believes  estimates  potential  or continue  or a similar negative phrase or other comparable terminology regarding beliefs  plans  expectations or intentions for the future 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that may involve risks and uncertainties  such as adverse changes in general market conditions for business and leisure travel as a result of additional terrorist activities  action by us military forces  changes in hotel room rates  capacity adjustments by airlines  trends in the overall demand for travel  and the inherent difficulty in making projections during this period of uncertainty  as well as other risks and uncertainties described in this annual report 
pegasus actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors including those set forth in pegasus filings with the securities and exchange commission  specifically including the risk factors set forth under item of this annual report on form k 
dependence on the hotel industry and impact of the economic recession and september  events our business  particularly our hospitality segment  is sensitive to changes in the demand for and average daily rates associated with hotel rooms 
the travel industry has been adversely impacted by the current economic recession and other world events  predicated in part by the terrorist attacks of september   the following retaliation  the continuing terrorist threat alerts  and the possibility of war with iraq and other military actions 
the overall long term impact of these events on pegasus and the travel industry is uncertain 
both the number of reservations and the average daily rate charged for hotel rooms sharply declined following september  primarily due to the decrease in demand 
although the recovery in the number of reservations was quicker than anticipated  transatlantic business travel and average daily rates have not yet fully recovered and continue to lag behind the recovery in transaction volumes 
since our electronic distribution and crs revenues are primarily transaction based  revenues for these services  which had sharp decreases immediately following september   recovered relatively quickly and  for  were close to the levels seen prior to september  however  since our hospitality and commission processing services are based in large part on a combination of reservation volume and average daily rates  their recovery has been somewhat slower 
in addition  we experienced an increase in the sales cycle for some of our services  as new customers were hesitant to sign new contracts given the uncertain economic environment 
the adverse impact of both the economy in the united states and internationally and the september  events has resulted in a decrease in the demand for and a reduction in the average daily rates for hotel rooms and  therefore  has negatively impacted our revenues 
we expect this trend to continue at least through revenues the classification of service revenues and customer reimbursements has been reflected in the financial statements to conform with current year presentation and to give effect to the adoption of eitf under eitf  pegasus billings for out of pocket expenses  such as third party vendor gds and telecommunication charges  are now classified as customer reimbursements  which is a component of total revenues  and the related costs are classified as customer reimbursements  which is a component of total costs of services 
the adoption of eitf had no effect on our financial position  operating loss  cash flows or per share results 
revenues applicable to customer reimbursements are primarily related to gds fees that we pay on behalf of and subsequently bill our customers 
in the future  if our customers decide to pay their bills directly  our customer reimbursements revenue and customer reimbursements cost of services will decrease accordingly 
technology reservation services 
crs revenues consist of transaction fees as well as license  maintenance and support fees related to our rezview software 
electronic distribution revenues primarily consist of transaction fees  commissions and monthly subscription or maintenance fees 
in addition  new hotel customers pay a one time fee for establishing the connection between the hotel s central reservation system and the electronic distribution technology 
new third party web site customers typically pay a one time fee for establishing the connection between the third party web site and our electronic distribution technology 
reservation services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for financial services 
financial services revenues primarily consist of both travel agency and hotel fees 
travel agency fees are based on a percentage of the value of hotel commissions processed by pegasus on behalf of participating travel agencies 
revenues from travel agency fees can vary substantially from period to period based on the types of hotels at which reservations are made and fluctuations in overall room rates 
in addition  participating hotels generally pay fees based on the number of commissionable transactions that pegasus processes for the hotel 
financial services revenues represented approximately percent of service revenues for property systems and services 
property systems and services revenues for primarily consisted of maintenance and support fees related to the rez and gets acquisitions 
in addition  property system revenues include fees from our pegasuscentral product  which are recognized monthly 
property systems and services represented approximately percent of service revenues for hospitality hotel representation 
hotel representation service revenues consist of reservation processing fees  membership fees and fees for various marketing services 
our hotel representation services represented approximately percent of service revenues for in addition  pegasus allows international travelers  who book rooms at hotels for which we provide representation services  to prepay for their hotel rooms in the traveler s local currency 
when a traveler arrives at the hotel  pegasus remits the amount to the hotel in the hotel s local currency 
revenues for this service are derived from the difference in the exchange rate between the date the traveler pays and the date the guest stay occurs 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for information regarding our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
other services pegasus regularly seeks to develop new services to capitalize on its existing technology and customer base and to provide additional electronic hotel reservation capabilities and information services to its existing customers and to other participants in the travel distribution process 
pegasus has not received a material amount of revenue from these services  and there can be no assurance that any of these services will produce a material amount of revenue in the future 
costs pegasus cost of services consists principally of personnel costs relating to information technology  customer service  telemarketing  facilities and equipment maintenance costs 
cost of services also includes the cost of customer reimbursements 
research and development costs consist principally of personnel costs  related overhead costs and fees paid to outside consultants 
general and administrative expenses are primarily personnel  legal and accounting related 
marketing and promotion expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  advertising  public relations and participation in trade shows and other industry events 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of computer equipment  office furniture  office equipment and leasehold improvements  as well as amortization of software  and other intangible assets and  for years prior to  goodwill 
interest expense through june includes interest on a note payable to reed elsevier plc 
fluctuation of foreign currencies pegasus  particularly our hospitality segment  derives a significant portion of its revenue from customers located outside the united states 
particularly in europe  fluctuations of foreign currencies such as the euro and the british pound relative to the us dollar result in pegasus earning more or less revenue than it otherwise might have earned if currency rates had remained stable 
recent developments travelweb  llc  formerly known as hotel distribution system  llc on february   pegasus and five hotel chains hilton hotels  hyatt corporation  marriott international  six continents hotels and starwood hotels announced the formation of travelweb  llc  formerly known as hotel distribution system  llc 
this new venture was formed to distribute discounted hotel rooms over the internet through multiple internet sites using a merchant business model 
under the merchant model  travelweb receives hotel room inventory from suppliers at wholesale or net rates 
travelweb then sets the retail price for the hotel room and processes the transaction as the merchant of record  which enables travelweb to receive a higher level of gross profit per transaction than in a fee per booking arrangement 
under the merchant model  travelweb generally is not obligated to pay suppliers for unsold inventory 
travelweb utilizes our technology to create a direct connection between hotel reservation systems and internet sites 
travelweb has signed an agreement with orbitz  llc to distribute the room inventory on a non exclusive basis  and our utell subsidiary was one of the first hotel suppliers to distribute room inventory through travelweb 
on april  we entered into a three year technology agreement with travelweb to develop technology and provide services that automate the net rate reservation and merchant model processes for travelweb and participating hotels 
during the year ended december   we contributed million in cash and  in development costs to travelweb  llc 
in addition  we transferred our consumer internet site  travelweb 
com  as part of our capital contribution to the venture 
because we are equal partners with five hotel companies and do not exercise significant influence  our investment in travelweb is accounted for under the cost method 
as a result  we will not recognize any income or loss related to this investment unless we receive dividends or we determine the investment to be impaired 
pegspay in june  we launched pegspay  an asp based service for travel businesses that operate under the merchant model 
pegspay automates the exchange of funds and incentives between travel distributors such as tour operators  online net rate providers  consolidators and wholesalers  and any type of travel supplier  including hotels  car rental companies  airlines  railways and cruise lines 
pegspay provides an automated  more efficient process for both the travel distributor and the travel supplier  providing confidence that the financial transactions supporting their relationship will be complete  dependable and supported by quality service and information 
the new service allows the travel distributor to pay each travel supplier via one consolidated payment in the travel supplier s choice of currency and in the manner in which the supplier wishes to be paid eg  check or direct deposit 
additionally  the travel supplier receives detailed reservation reporting that allows them to better manage their net rate distribution programs

further  any debt financing may involve restrictive covenants  and any equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders 
inflation pegasus does not believe that inflation has materially impacted results of operations during the past three years 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could have a significant impact on its results of operations to the extent such increases are not passed along to customers 
critical accounting policies preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported financial position and results of operations during the reporting period 
our estimates and judgments are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because the use of estimates is inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from estimates 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it will likely result in a material adverse impact to our business  operating results and financial condition 
certain accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
pegasus considers the following to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
for a detailed discussion of the company s accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounts and notes receivables as of december   pegasus had accounts receivable as a result of its ongoing operations of approximately million 
additionally  pegasus has notes receivable totaling million at december   related to the sale of business units 
these receivables are monitored by management for collectibility 
pegasus maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimates of losses require judgments that are based on available information and experience  such as the payment histories and known financial conditions of the parties 
these estimates are significant because pegasus may incur additional expense to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts and may receive less cash than expected if the financial condition of the parties was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments 
pegasus allowances for doubtful accounts totaled approximately million as of december  impairment of assets as of december   pegasus has goodwill related to its acquisitions of rez and gets totaling approximately million 
under the guidance of fas  goodwill is allocated to the two operating segments of pegasus and goodwill for each segment is periodically analyzed for impairment 
these practices require significant estimates and judgments by management  involving the carrying value of each segment and the estimated fair value of each segment 
the estimated fair value of each segment requires significant judgment in estimating future cash flows from operations for the various services provided by pegasus 
while the most recent periodic impairment analysis indicated that no impairment of goodwill exists  variances in actual growth rates  operating margins  or other assumptions may impact the impairment analysis and affect the carrying values of goodwill for the operating segments 
as of december   pegasus has unamortized capitalized software costs totaling million  which requires periodic analysis for impairment 
this impairment analysis requires the comparison of unamortized carrying values to estimated net realizable values 
the estimated net realizable value is based on significant judgments such as estimated future cash flows from the related services  or expected benefits of the software and are based on available information and experience 
while the most recent periodic impairment analyses indicated that no impairment of capitalized software costs exists  changes in strategy  market conditions or other assumptions may significantly impact these judgments and affect the carrying values of capitalized software costs 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates  and the disclosure in this section of this report regarding them  with our audit committee 
employee benefit plans in the united states and the united kingdom  pegasus sponsors defined benefit plans for certain employees 
our employee pension costs and obligations are dependent upon our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include salary growth  long term return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
the salary growth assumptions are either stated in the plan or reflect our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical results of the portfolio and management s expectation of the current economic environment 
specific to the plan provided in the united kingdom  which is a funded plan  a one percent change in expected returns on plan assets would result in a  change to pegasus annual expense associated with this plan 
we base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields  including applicable corporate long term bond yields 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the future working life of the plan participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension costs and obligations 
additionally  pegasus recently announced strategic integration plan could have an effect on the assumptions used in accounting for our employee benefit plans

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pegasus is exposed to certain market risks  including the effects of movements in foreign currency exchange rates  and uses derivative financial instrument contracts to manage foreign exchange risks 
pegasus has established a control environment that includes policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
company policy prohibits holding or issuing derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on consolidated results of operations and future foreign currency denominated cash flows  the company was a party to various forward exchange contracts at december  these contracts reduce exposure to currency movements affecting existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities primarily trade receivables and payables 
a summary of forward exchange contracts in place at december  follows in thousands sell purchase australian dollar canadian dollar swiss franc danish krone euro  british pound  hong kong dollar japanese yen norwegian krona swedish krona singapore dollar south african rand total  all contracts matured no later than february because of the short term nature of these contracts  the fair value approximates the contract value 
the difference between the fair value and contract value is included in the consolidated balance sheet as accounts receivable and was not material at december  during the fiscal year ended december   pegasus used similar forward exchange contracts and had either sell or purchase forward exchange contracts of a similarly short term nature in place on december  as of december   pegasus had approximately million in sell forward exchange contracts and  in purchase forward exchange contracts 
pegasus positions with respect to these forward exchange contracts differed as of december  compared to december  because of changes in pegasus non us denominated trade payables and receivables
