item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for purposes of this discussion and analysis section  reference is made to the table below and the company s consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item we have two principal operating groups maintenance products and electrical electronics 
the segment labeled as other consists of a minority equity investment in a seafood harvesting and farming company  as well as an operation exited by katy in may which operated a waste to energy facility 
two businesses formerly included in the electrical electronics group  gc waldom and hamilton  have been classified as discontinued operations 
gc waldom was held for sale at december  and was sold on april   and hamilton was sold in october gross proceeds on the sale of gc waldom were million 
we do not expect to record a significant gain or loss in related to the sale of gc waldom 
key elements in achieving profitability in the maintenance products group include maintaining a low cost structure  both from a production and administrative standpoint  and providing outstanding customer service 
most of our products in the maintenance products group do not rely upon strong brand equity the exception being duckback s products  so achieving and maintaining a position as a low cost producer is a necessity  given that our comparative price point on many products is below those of our competitors 
new product development is especially important in the consumer retail markets for maintenance products  as new products or beneficial modifications of existing products increase demand from our customers  provide novelty to the consumer  and offer an opportunity for favorable pricing from customers in the national mass market retail area 
retention of customers  or more specifically  product lines with those customers  is also very important in the mass market retail area  given the vast size of these national accounts 
prices for raw materials  especially plastic resins  have a very significant impact on contico  the largest division within the maintenance products group 
key elements in achieving profitability in the electrical electronics group are in many ways similar to those mentioned for our maintenance products group 
achieving and maintaining a low cost structure is critical given the significant level of foreign competition  primarily from asia and latin america 
for this reason  in december  woods ceased all us manufacturing and initiated a fully outsourced strategy for its consumer electrical corded products 
customer service  specifically the ability to fill orders at a rate designated by our customers  is very important to customer retention  given seasonal sales pressures in the consumer electrical area 
retention of customers is critical in the electrical electronics group  given the size of national accounts

compared to maintenance products group the maintenance products group had a mixed year in operating income  excluding severance  restructuring  and impairment charges  was up over  as the various cost reduction programs put into place over the last two years have begun to impact results 
while the improvement in profitability was a positive step  significant improvement over was expected since was an especially weak year in the maintenance products group 
sales volumes were down overall from  with the largest decrease in the contico consumer products business 
sales from the maintenance products group decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
the largest sales decrease occurred within the consumer business  which sells primarily to mass market retail customers 
while certain product lines with retail customers remained stable  the revenue declines were caused by the loss of certain product lines  as well as selected price erosion with retail customers through allowance  rebate  and other pricing programs 
in addition to continually striving to reduce our cost structure  we are seeking to offset these challenges by developing new products for the retail markets 
the development of new products is essential to remaining competitive and to maintaining strong relationships with large national mass market retail customers 
sales in the maintenance products divisions serving commercial markets primarily janitorial sanitation were essentially flat versus glit microtron s abrasives business saw a significant increase in sales from  with sales increasing year over year for seven of their top ten customers 
glit microtron s sales increases included increases with several key  sizable  janitorial sanitation distributors 
glit microtron also grew its business with a large national retail chain  for which glit microtron supplies their full stock of floor cleaning abrasive pads for internal use at their stores nationwide 
sales were also higher in the international markets of katy s janitorial sanitation businesses  primarily in the uk and canada 
these positive sales trends were offset by lower sales at contico s janitorial sanitation business continental and at wilen mops  brooms and brushes 
we believe that these negative sales comparisons are in part due to the downturn in the travel hotels  airports  restaurant  and hospitality sectors of the economy  to which many of our maintenance products are sold 
other factors resulting from the worsening overall economic environment are higher vacancy rates in office buildings  distribution facilities  and other commercial facilities where professional cleaning products are used 
the maintenance products group also made positive steps in toward managing the various janitorial sanitation supply divisions as one group  consolidating more of the customer service and administrative functions of these divisions in st 
louis  missouri 
by the end of  we expect to have centralized customer service and administrative functions for continental  glit microtron  wilen and disco in place  allowing customers to order products from any division on one purchase order 
we believe that operating these businesses as a cohesive unit will improve customer service in that our customers purchasing processes will be simplified  as will follow up on order status  billing  collection and other related functions 
this should increase customer loyalty  help in attracting new customers and lead to increased top line sales in future years 
the group s operating loss improved by million from million in to million in  an improvement of 
the operating loss was primarily a result of costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments  which are discussed further below 
excluding those items  operating income improved by million from million in to million in the improvement in income was primarily driven by glit microtron  contico and wilen 
glit microtron s operating income improvement was driven by strong sales volume and cost reductions in numerous areas  including raw materials  freight  and headcount 
contico s operating income improved mainly due to cost reductions implemented on a continuing basis throughout and producing results 
the wilen business deteriorated during and due to operational problems that were largely remedied in in addition  significant new business was gained in early from a large national mass market retail store chain  who will use wilen mops for their in store floor care needs  providing meaningful levels of new sales to use capacity existing at the wilen plant 
during  the maintenance products group recorded significant valuation reserve adjustments associated with inventory and receivables  totaling million 
operating income improved by million as a result of the cessation of goodwill amortization per the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
operating results in were negatively impacted by several unusual charges 
the group incurred severance and restructuring charges of million 
the largest of these charges was the establishment of million of liabilities for non cancelable lease payments at abandoned contico facilities  the operations of which have been or will be consolidated into contico s largest  most modern plant in bridgeton  missouri 
the establishment of these liabilities involves estimates of future sub lease income 
we generally assumed that there will be no sub lease income on these facilities until january  at which time a portion of the facility costs are expected to be recovered 
adjustments to these liabilities are possible in the future depending upon the accuracy of sub lease assumptions made 
charges of million were incurred in related to the movement of equipment and inventory from an abandoned facility  and severance payments of million were made to employees impacted by this move 
the maintenance products group incurred approximately million in consulting fees associated with outsourcing strategies  relating mainly to the wilen business 
while current plans call for wilen to continue in a manufacturing capacity  the outsourcing project resulted in improved prices from some new vendors on products that had already been outsourced 
the group incurred million of severance costs related to various headcount reductions  primarily at the executive level of operating divisions 
the maintenance products group also incurred million associated with transitioning administrative and accounting functions of wilen and glit microtron to st 
louis  missouri  where those functions are now performed by contico 
the maintenance products group recognized impairment charges on certain long lived assets totaling million in certain contico property  plant and equipment  primarily molds and tooling assets  were impaired by million  and a customer list intangible was impaired by million 
the majority of these impairments were associated with assets used in the contico consumer business  and were the result of analyses indicating insufficient future cash flows to cover the carrying values of the assets 
it was determined that portions of the carrying values of certain assets would not be recovered by future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets 
given the unique nature of molds for specific products  the fair values  if any  are often less than historical cost  resulting in impairments 
the wilen business unit recorded asset impairments of million  resulting from management decisions on the future use of certain manufacturing assets in the atlanta  georgia plant 
operating results in for the maintenance products group were also negatively impacted by several unusual charges 
we recorded an impairment charge of million at wilen because consistently poor operating performance led us to conclude that the carrying values of certain long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows 
in addition to the impairment at wilen  an additional million of impairment charges were taken  related primarily to management decisions regarding the discontinuance of certain property  plant and equipment 
additional items that negatively impacted operating results during include severance and restructuring charges of million  primarily at contico and wilen 
identifiable assets for the group decreased primarily as a result of the impairments noted above  and due to the fact that normal depreciation expense exceeded capital expenditures for the group 
electrical electronics group the electrical electronics group had a positive year in  driven primarily by improved sales volume over  and secondarily  by higher margins over the prior year 
in addition  during a major restructuring occurred at the woods business 
after significant study and research into different sourcing alternatives  we decided that woods would source all of its products from asia 
in december  woods shut down all us manufacturing facilities  which were in suburban indianapolis and in southern indiana 
as a result of these plant closures  employees were terminated 
the following charges were recorded related to the shut down severance and other closure costs of million  asset impairments of million  and write offs of excess raw material inventory on hand at the time of the shut down of million 
the electrical electronics group s sales increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
higher sales volumes to the two largest customers of woods  both national mass market retailers  drove the sales increase 
sales to these two customers combined were up million  or  from higher volumes of direct import merchandise  which are shipped directly from our suppliers to our customers  such as extension cords and power strips  drove the higher sales to one of these customers 
the strong relationships with these large customers have provided a solid foundation for growth in the woods business 
woods canada also experienced a significant sales increase to its largest customer  also a large mass market retailer  to whom sales were higher by 
a portion of the sales growth at woods from to was due to a significant increase in purchases from a large customer  and some portion of the sales may not occur again in the group s operating income increased from million in to million in operating income was reduced by costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments  which are discussed further below 
excluding these costs  operating income increased from million in to million in  an increase of 
higher sales volumes aided in maintaining margins  and ongoing cost control has allowed woods and woods canada to reduce product and variable costs 
during  woods incurred a loss of million related to obsolete raw material and packaging inventory on hand which could not be utilized following the shutdown of the us manufacturing facilities see next paragraph 
significant factors impacting results include lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustments totaling million  the largest of which related to the exit of certain licensed branded product lines by woods in the first quarter of woods had entered into several proprietary licensed branding agreements with several companies well known in the electronics and computer industries  but efforts to market the products proved unsuccessful 
woods also incurred a litigation loss reserve of million 
woods also wrote off a related million amount of prepaid maintenance related to software licenses see next paragraph 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were negatively impacted in versus  as a result of the existence in of amortization of negative goodwill an income item of million 
operating results in were negatively impacted by a number of restructuring related charges 
the electrical electronics group incurred consulting fees of million associated with product outsourcing strategies 
in december  as mentioned above  woods incurred charges related to the shut down of all us manufacturing operations of million for severance and other exit costs  and million of impaired assets that will not be utilized following the shut down of woods facilities 
the group also incurred several unusual charges in woods incurred million of severance and other exit costs in early associated with the closure of several satellite manufacturing facilities in southern indiana 
asset impairments of million were recorded  related primarily to previously capitalized software licenses that were not being used 
we believe that restructuring steps executed in related to the woods business will allow that business to remain competitive within its markets 
the fully outsourced product strategy has reduced headcount at the woods division by employees effective in mid december we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to divestitures of certain of our businesses 
divestitures present opportunities to de leverage our financial position and free up cash for further investments in core activities 
on march   we announced that we are exploring the sale of the woods and woods canada businesses 
however  there can be no assurance that a sale of the woods and woods canada business can be completed 
other sales from other operations decreased by million  or  as a result of the sesco waste to energy operation being turned over to a third party in april  compared to a full year s sales in operating income from other operations in was driven by an unusual charge of million  relating to an obligation created by katy to the third party who took over operation of the sesco facility 
amounts will be paid in roughly equal installments through see note to the consolidated financial statements for katy in part ii  item  for a discussion of the sesco partnership transaction 
operating income in was impacted primarily by the million impairment of all of the long lived assets of the sesco operation 
the assets were written down in anticipation of a cash flow negative transaction that would be necessary for katy to exit the sesco business 
discontinued operations two business units are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented hamilton precisions metals  lp hamilton and gc waldom electronics  inc gc waldom 
hamilton generated million of operating income in prior to its sale on october   versus operating income of million in hamilton s business was affected by general economic conditions and lower capital spending within the markets hamilton serves 
gc waldom incurred a million operating loss in  versus a million operating loss in nearly the entire operating loss of gc waldom in is the result of asset valuation adjustments in anticipation of a sale of the business unit in early corporate during  the corporate group incurred million of severance and restructuring charges and million of costs associated with completing the recapitalization 
the majority of the severance and restructuring charges relate to payments made in connection with management transition 
included in this amount is approximately million of charges that relate to outside consultants working with katy to modify operating and financial strategies  and million of non cancelable rent and other exit costs associated with the premature termination of our leased office facility in englewood  colorado 
the largest portions of the million of costs associated with the recapitalization were non capitalizable legal fees and investment banker fees  board and committee fees and other internal incremental costs 
identifiable assets at corporate decreased due to two primary items 
cash was lower by million due to more efficient management of borrowed funds at the end of versus and net deferred tax assets were lower by million as a result of additional valuation allowance adjustments in interest was lower by million  or  in compared to  primarily due to significant reductions in outstanding debt balances due to the infusion of equity capital with the recapitalization on june   and reductions in debt as a result of working capital reductions in the last half of our effective tax rate in was  indicating that million of tax provision was recorded on a million pretax loss 
a net tax provision was recorded on the loss rather than a net tax benefit because we determined that a greater valuation allowance was required on our net deferred tax asset position 
see deferred income taxes in critical accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item  for further discussion of income tax accounting 
the effective tax rate in  while resulting in book benefit on a pretax book loss  was only  due to a significant increase in valuation allowances on net operating loss deferred tax assets 
we also recorded a million  net of tax  transitional goodwill impairment as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 which is shown on the consolidated statements of operations as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for a further discussion of goodwill impairments 
compared to maintenance products group sales in the maintenance products group decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
sales decreased in at contico and wilen  and to a lesser extent at duckback  gemtex and disco 
sales increased at glit microtron and loren 
the group experienced weakness in both the retail and institutional sectors to which it sells 
retailers efforts to reduce inventories  especially in early  led to softer sales for contico and duckback  and a slower economy contributed to softer sales in the janitorial sanitation markets 
the group s operating income decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
operating income was reduced by costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments  which are discussed further below 
excluding the impact of these items  operating income for the group declined from million in to million in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales improved at contico  glit microtron  loren and disco  offset by higher percentages of sg a expenses at wilen  duckback and gemtex 
the overall improvement in sg a expenses excluding the unusual items was offset by reduced gross margins at all businesses  led by contico 
decreased volumes and the inability to reduce overhead accordingly was the main cause of the margin decreases 
offsetting these factors were prices paid for various resins  a key raw material for plastic products produced by contico  which were lower in than in  especially for polypropylene 
the lower prices for resins taken alone accounted for approximately million in lower cost of goods sold during versus the maintenance products group recorded valuation reserve adjustments for inventory and receivables of million during  contributing to the lower operating results 
results included a million increase expense to the lifo inventory reserve at contico and an inventory write down at wilen of million operating results in were negatively impacted by unusual items of million 
we recorded an impairment charge of million at wilen because consistently poor operating performance led us to conclude that the carrying values of certain long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows 
in addition to the impairment at wilen  an additional million of impairment charges were taken  related primarily to management decisions regarding the discontinuance of certain property  plant and equipment 
additional items that negatively impacted operating results during include severance and restructuring charges of million  primarily at contico and wilen 
operating results in were negatively impacted by million in severance and restructuring charges identifiable assets for the group decreased by million from million in to million in  a decrease of 
the decrease was due in part to the million write off of long lived assets in the mop  broom and brush business 
an inventory reduction effort on a company wide basis resulted in lower working capital levels at each division in depreciation expense in excess of capital expenditures also contributed to the decline 
electrical electronics group the electrical electronics group s sales decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
sales volumes were lower in at both woods and woods canada 
we sold thorsen tools during the second quarter of  which accounted for million of the sales decrease 
the sales decreases were primarily attributable to slower economic conditions during  especially as those conditions caused retailers to reduce inventory levels during the early portion of the group s operating income decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
operating income was reduced by costs for severance  restructuring and related costs  and asset impairments  which are discussed further below 
operating results excluding these unusual items decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
positive factors included significant reductions in sg a expenses at woods and woods canada in as compared to negative factors in included million of inventory lower of cost or market adjustments  the largest occurring at woods relating to exiting licensed branded product lines million 
negative factors impacting operating income in included a charge of million for costs associated with a product recall 
operating results in were reduced by unusual items of million  including severance and restructuring charges of million and related impairments of long lived assets of million 
unusual items impacted operating results in as well  including a million severance charge at woods 
identifiable assets for the group decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of 
lower working capital levels at woods and woods canada drove this decrease 
these reductions were the result of aggressive efforts to reduce inventories  as well as lower levels of capital expenditures 
also  assets of thorsen tools  which were sold during  accounted for approximately million of the reduction 
other sales from other operations increased modestly as a result of higher sales at the sesco waste to energy facility 
operating income from other operations decreased million  primarily as a result of a million impairment of our investment in sesco s waste to energy facility and related property  plant and equipment 
excluding the effect of the write off  operating income increased million at the sesco waste to energy facility 
identifiable assets for our other operations decreased million in connection with the write off of katy s investment in the sesco waste to energy facility 
corporate during  the corporate group incurred million of severance and restructuring charges and million of other unusual items 
the majority of the severance and restructuring charges relate to payments made in connection with management transition 
included in this amount is approximately million of charges that relate to outside consultants working with katy to modify operating and financial strategies  and million of non cancelable rent and other exit costs associated with the premature termination of our leased office facility in englewood  colorado 
the largest portion of the other unusual items were approximately million of costs associated with the recapitalization  including non capitalizable legal fees and investment banker fees  board and committee fees and other internal incremental costs 
other unusual items included increases to claims and environmental reserves of million and other items totaling million 
corporate expenses in were negatively impacted by million in unusual items  including million of severance and restructuring charges and million of costs associated with the recapitalization  partially offset by proceeds of million related to a previously written off investment 
interest was lower by million  or  in compared to  primarily due to the reduction in bank debt caused by the recapitalization in june of bank debt was reduced by million when the recapitalization occurred 
we incurred an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  net of tax  at the time of the recapitalization 
this loss represented the write off of previously capitalized debt costs 
the effective income tax rate for continuing operations reduced from in to in  resulting in lowered tax benefit from book losses in the lower tax rate and benefit were the result of valuation allowance adjustments placed on certain deferred tax assets  particularly federal net operating loss carry forwards 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity was our strongest performance measure in  with overall debt decreasing by million from million at the end of to million at the end of cash decreased by million from million at the end of to million at the end of during  we accomplished the following o generated operating cash flow of million 
o incurred capital expenditures from continuing operations of million 
o sold the hamilton business for gross proceeds of million 
o the three items listed above  along with strong working capital management in  allowed us to repay by october the entire remaining balance of the million term loan with deutsche bank  which was obtained in june at the time of the recapitalization 
the term loan was scheduled to be paid ratably through june of at december   scheduled remaining maturities of term debt per the repayment amortization schedule in the loan document would have been million 
in addition  during  the following events occurred o in february  we funded a new credit agreement  agented by fleet capital fleet credit agreement  which replaced the credit agreement entered into at the time of the recapitalization in june of deutsche bank credit agreement 
the new million facility  which provides for million of term debt and million of revolving debt  involves a syndicate of banks  all of whom had participated in the deutsche bank credit agreement 
the fleet credit agreement is an asset based lending agreement  and is generally on similar terms to those found in the deutsche bank credit agreement 
the term of the agreement is through january  o sold the gc waldom business for gross proceeds of million  which allowed us to further reduce our debt obligations 
while book losses in were significant  large portions of these losses were due to non cash events such as impairments of assets million  depreciation and amortization million  and the creation of liabilities to be paid in future years  such as the sesco obligation see discussion regarding contractual obligations below million  discounted and the recording of liabilities for non cancelable leases at several operating locations million  discounted 
strong collections of receivables late in  as well as management of accounts payable  resulted in working capital improvement in with the early pay down of the term loan in october  we set out to take out a new term loan  which is collateralized by real and personal property  in order to most efficiently leverage our entire asset base  and to create more borrowing room under our revolving credit arrangements  which are based on the liquidation values of accounts receivable and inventories 
we believe we have accomplished these goals by entering into the fleet credit agreement in february of below is a summary of the sources and uses associated with the funding of the fleet credit agreement thousands of dollars sources term loan borrowings under the fleet credit agreement  revolving loan borrowings under the fleet credit agreement  uses payment of interest and principal under the deutsche bank credit agreement  purchase of outstanding preferred interest of contico at a discount  payment of accrued distributions on outstanding preferred interest of contico certain costs associated with the fleet credit agreement the fleet credit agreement  which provides for a total borrowing facility of million  has a million term loan portion with a final maturity date of february  and quarterly repayments of million  the first of which will be made on april  a final payment of million is scheduled to be made in the term loan is based on orderly liquidation values of the company s property  plant and equipment 
the remaining portion of the fleet credit agreement is a million revolving credit facility that also has an expiration date of february  the borrowing base of the revolving credit facility is determined by eligible inventory and accounts receivable 
unused borrowing availability on the revolving credit facility was million at february  all extensions of credit under the fleet credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority perfected security interest in and lien upon the capital stock of each material domestic subsidiary of the capital stock of each material foreign subsidiary  and all present and future assets and properties of katy 
customary financial covenants and restrictions apply under the fleet credit agreement 
until june   interest accrues on revolving borrowings at basis points over applicable libor rates  and at basis points over libor for term borrowings 
subsequent to june   margins are determined on a pricing matrix which factors operating performance into the pricing grid 
margins drop an additional basis points in the most favorable pricing grid from the pre june levels 
interest accrues at higher margins on prime rates for swing loans 
katy incurred million in debt issuance costs associated with the fleet credit agreement 
however  katy expects to charge to expense during the first quarter of approximately million of previously capitalized debt issuance costs from the deutsche bank credit agreement 
while approximately million of debt issuance costs were capitalized at the time of the inception of the fleet credit agreement  the million represents an amount derived from the pro rata reduction in borrowing capacity from the duetsche bank credit agreement to the fleet credit agreement 
the remainder of the previously capitalized costs  along with the newly capitalized costs from the fleet credit agreement will be amortized over the life of the fleet credit agreement  through january with regard to the deutsche bank credit agreement  we were in compliance with all covenants related to the agreement at december  total debt was of total capitalization at december  the revolving credit facilities under the deutsche bank credit agreement required lockbox agreements which provided for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding 
these agreements  combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the deutsche bank credit agreement  caused the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability  per guidance in the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
however  the company did not expect to repay  or be required to repay  within one year  the balance of the revolving credit facility classified as a current liability 
the mae clause  which is a fairly typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it determines there has been a material adverse effect on our operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
the classification of the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two aforementioned factors the lockbox agreements and the mae clause 
however  the revolving credit facility under the deutsche bank credit agreement did not expire or have a maturity date within one year  but rather had a final expiration date of june  also  we were in compliance with the applicable financial covenants at december  the lender had not notified us of any indication of a mae at december   and to our knowledge  we were not in default of any provision of the deutsche bank credit agreement at december  the fleet credit agreement also calls for similar lockbox arrangements  and has language regarding material adverse changes 
we anticipate that our obligations under the revolving credit facility will continue to be classified as current liabilities 
the fleet credit agreement  and the additional borrowing ability on revolving credit obtained by incurring new term debt  results in three important benefits related to the long term strategy of katy allowed us to redeem early at a discount a preferred interest obligation of contico  provides borrowing power to invest in capital expenditures key to our strategic direction  and provides working capital flexibility to build inventory when necessary to accommodate lower cost outsourced finished goods inventory 
we feel that our operations and the fleet credit agreement provide sufficient liquidity for our operations going forward 
as a result of the refinance with the new fleet credit agreement  we were able to redeem at a discount the remaining preferred interest that the former owner of contico had held 
this balance sheet liability  which had a carrying value of million at december   was redeemed for million in february the gain on this redemption will be an addition to stockholders equity  and will favorably impact earnings per share 
this will result in a reduction of preferred cash distributions by approximately million annually  which had accrued at an annual rate of 
after giving effect to the interest cost incurred by the company to fund the redemption  the net decrease in financing cost for the company will be approximately million annually 
funding for capital expenditures and working capital needs is expected to be accomplished through the use of available borrowings under the fleet credit agreement 
anticipated capital expenditures are expected to be higher in than in and  mainly due to investments planned for the restructuring of the abrasives businesses and the various contico facilities 
these restructuring and consolidation activities are important to reducing our cost structure to a competitive level 
our borrowing base under the fleet credit agreement is reduced by the outstanding amount of standby and commercial letters of credit 
vendors  financial institutions and other parties with whom katy does business may require letters of credit in the future that either do not exist today  or would be at higher amounts than those that exist today 
our largest letters of credit relate to our casualty insurance programs 
we have a number of obligations and commitments  which are listed on the schedule later in this section entitled contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we have considered all of these obligations and commitments in structuring our capital resources to ensure that they can be met 
see the notes accompanying the table in that section for further discussions of those items 
businesses classified as discontinued operations were both sold by early therefore  we will not have the benefit of the cash flow generated by those businesses in the past 
however  the proceeds of the sales of those businesses were used to pay down debt  more than offsetting the negative liquidity impact of losing their cash flow from operations 
we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to divestitures of certain of our businesses 
divestitures present opportunities to de leverage our financial position and free up cash for further investments in core activities 
on march   we announced that we are exploring the sale of the woods and woods canada businesses 
however  there can be no assurance that a sale of the woods and woods canada business will be completed 
on april   we announced the sale of gc waldom with gross proceeds of million  which were used to reduce our debt obligations 
on february   we announced that we sold a woods manufacturing facility in moorseville  indiana 
gross proceeds were million  of which million was used to repay a mortgage loan payable on the property 
the remainder of the proceeds reduced our debt obligations 
non gaap financial measure earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda cash flow generation is integral to the success of our business  and ebitda is used on a routine basis as a measure of operating performance at katy 
while it is a non gaap measure  ebitda is used extensively on an internal basis  acting as a primary metric for performance measurement related to incentive compensation for management 
ebitda is also the prime measure of operating results used by the lenders in our bank group when evaluating our performance 
while appreciating the importance of depreciation charges and the information operating income provides regarding returns on assets  we actively monitor the payback and return on capital projects by thorough review of projects prior to their approval  ensuring that returns on those projects are specified in operating budgets  and subsequent follow up on the return provided by those projects 
the items added back in the table below to arrive at an ebitda amount shown below should not be ignored or considered irrelevant in the analysis of our performance 
however  management routinely views operating results with unusual items such as those below excluded  so that a reasonable profitability answer can be derived that can be used as a reliable indicator for future performance 
we think it is useful for investors to understand ebitda because it provides a link between profitability and operating cash flow  and also allows the investor to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management

 goodwill and intangible assets 
b severance and restructuring costs include costs related to accruals for non cancelable lease payments for rented facilities that have been  or will be  abandoned as part of facilities consolidation or other restructuring projects  severance charges for terminated employees  consultant fees for outsourcing and other restructuring projects  costs to move inventory and equipment between facilities related to consolidation projects

ebitda  excluding unusual items as shown above  increased by million from million in to million in  an improvement of 
higher ebitda was generated in both the maintenance products group and the electrical electronics group in versus the reasons for the improvements in ebitda for both segments are largely the same as those discussed for operating income in the results of operations discussion above regarding versus ebitda in was negatively impacted by valuation adjustments of million for excess and obsolete inventory 
ebitda enhances the understanding of our liquidity and helps provide a link between earnings and cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows in part ii  item depreciation  amortization  impairments of long lived assets and increases to valuation allowances on deferred tax assests are non cash charges 
also  certain severance  restructuring and related charges did not result in cash outflows in  but created liabilities that will be settled in future years  most significantly  those for non cancelable lease liabilities associated with facilities that have been or will be abandoned as a result of restructuring and consolidation efforts 
included in severance  restructuring and related charges in are costs of million for the establishment of these types of liabilities 
the balance sheet liabilities for these types of costs increased by million from december  to december  this change is reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows in the line item which shows the change in accrued expenses and other liabilities as a positive adjustment from net income to cash provided by operating activities in as the non cancelable lease payments are made in future years  they will negatively impact operating cash flow through opposite changes in this line item 
see also the section entitled restructuring and severance charges for a discussion of charges and payments against restructuring reserves  and estimates of future settlement of related liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements on april   katy and sesco  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  entered into a partnership agreement with montenay power corporation and its affiliates montenay that turned over the operation of sesco s waste to energy facility to montenay 
the company entered into this agreement as a result of evaluations of sesco s business 
first  we determined that sesco was not a core component of our long term business strategy 
moreover  we did not feel the company had the management expertise to deal with certain risks and uncertainties presented by the operation of sesco s business  given that sesco was the company s only waste to energy facility 
we had explored options for divesting sesco for a number of years  and management felt that this transaction offered a reasonable strategy to exit this business 
the partnership  with montenay s leadership  assumed sesco s position in various contracts relating to the facility s operation 
under the agreement  sesco contributed its assets and liabilities except for its liability under the loan agreement with the resource recovery development authority the authority of the city of savannah and the related receivable under the service agreement to the partnership 
while sesco will maintain a partnership interest as a limited partner  montenay will have most of the day to day responsibility of the partnership  and accordingly  the partnership will not be consolidated 
katy agreed to pay montenay million over the span of seven years under a note payable as part of the partnership and related agreements 
this note payable is recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheets included in part ii  item certain amounts may be due to sesco upon expiration of the service agreement in  also  montenay may purchase sesco s interest in the partnership at that time 
katy has not recorded any amounts receivable or other assets relating to amounts that may be received at the time the service agreement expires  given their uncertainty 
the company recognized in the first quarter of a charge of million  consisting of the discounted value of the million note  which is payable over seven years  the carrying value of certain assets contributed to the partnership  consisting primarily of machinery spare parts  and costs to close the transaction 
it should be noted that all of sesco s long lived assets were reduced to a zero value at december   so no additional impairment was required 
going forward  katy does not expect any income statement activity as a result of its involvement in the partnership  and katy s balance sheet will carry the liability mentioned above 
in  the authority issued million of industrial revenue bonds and lent the proceeds to sesco  under the loan agreement for the acquisition and construction of the waste to energy facility that has now been transferred to the partnership 
the funds required to repay the loan agreement come from the monthly disposal fee paid by the authority to sesco under the service agreement for certain waste disposal services  a component of which is for debt service 
to induce the required parties to consent to the sesco partnership transaction  sesco retained its liability under the loan agreement 
in connection with that liability  sesco also retained its right to receive the debt service component of the monthly disposal fee 
based on an opinion from outside legal counsel  sesco has a legally enforceable right to offset amounts it owes to the authority under the loan agreement against amounts that are owed from the authority under the service agreement 
at december   this amount was million 
accordingly  the amounts owed to and due from sesco have been netted for financial reporting purposes and are not shown on the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition to sesco retaining its liabilities under the loan agreement  to induce the required parties to consent to the partnership transaction  katy also continues to guarantee the obligations of the partnership under the service agreement 
the partnership is liable for liquidated damages under the service agreement if it fails to accept the minimum amount of waste or to meet other performance standards under the service agreement 
the liquidated damages  an off balance sheet risk for katy  are equal to the amount of the bonds outstanding  less million maintained in a debt service reserve trust 
we do not expect non performance by the other parties 
additionally  montenay has agreed to indemnify katy for any breach of the service agreement by the partnership 
following are scheduled principal repayments on the loan agreement and the industrial revenue bonds in thousands total  we also enter into operating lease agreements in the ordinary course of business  and many of our facilities are leased 
contractual obligations associated with these leases are listed in the table under the following section entitled contractual obligations and commercial obligations

    total commercial commitments     a as discussed in the off balance sheet arrangements section above  sesco  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of katy  is party to a partnership that operates a waste to energy facility  and has certain contractual obligations  for which katy provides certain guarantees 
if the partnership is not able to perform its obligations under the contracts  under certain circumstances sesco and katy could be subject to damages equal to the amount of industrial revenue bonds outstanding which financed construction of the facility less amounts held by the partnership in debt service reserve funds 
katy and sesco do not anticipate non performance by parties to the contracts 
see the off balance sheet arrangements section above and note to consolidated financial statements 
b amount owed to montenay as a result of the sesco partnership  discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
million of this obligation is classified in the consolidated balance sheets as an accrued expense in current liabilities  while the remainder is included in other liabilities  recorded on a discounted basis 
c these severance and restructuring obligations represent liabilities associated with restructuring activities  other than liabilities for non cancelable lease rentals 
future non cancelable lease rentals are included in the line entitled operating leases 
our balance sheet at december   includes million in discounted liabilities associated with non cancelable operating lease rentals  net of estimated sub lease revenues  related to facilities that have been abandoned as a result of restructuring and consolidation activities 
d as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section above  the entire deutsche bank revolving credit facility is classified as a current liability on the consolidated statements of financial position as a result of the combination in the deutsche bank credit agreement of lockbox agreements on katy s depository bank accounts and a subjective material adverse effect mae clause 
the deutsche bank revolving credit facility was paid off on february   with funds received under the fleet credit agreement 
the fleet credit agreement contains similar provisions  and it is expected that borrowings under the fleet revolving facility will be classified as current as well 
e the preferred interest in subsidiary was redeemed early on february   coincident with the refinancing of katy s debt obligations through the fleet credit agreement 
the stated amount of million was redeemed at a discount for million 
the resulting million pre tax gain on the redemption will be recognized as an increase to paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets for period ended march other items effect of transactions with related and certain other parties in connection with the contico acquisition on january   we entered into building lease agreements with newcastle industries  inc newcastle 
newcastle was the holder of the million preferred interest in contico see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item 
lester miller  the former owner of contico  and a katy director from to  is the majority owner of newcastle 
also  several additional properties utilized by contico are leased directly from lester miller 
rental expense for these properties approximates historical market rates 
related party rental expense for the years ended december   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
we paid newcastle million of preferred distributions for the year ended december   compared to and million for each of the years ended december  and respectively 
the decreases in distributions were due to the early redemption at a discount of half of the preferred interest at the time of the recapitalization in june on february   the remainder of the preferred interest was redeemed at a discount 
as a result  we do not owe any further distributions 
kohlberg co  llc  an affiliate of kohlberg investors iv  llc  whose affiliate holds all  shares of our convertible preferred stock  provides ongoing management oversight and advisory services to katy 
we paid  for such services in  and expect to pay  annually in future years 
restructuring efforts and severance charges during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of severance and other exit costs associated with the shut down of the woods manufacturing facilities in indiana 
manufacturing operations were ceased in order to implement a more cost effective procurement of finished goods inventory through sourcing with third party suppliers 
operational employees were terminated as a result of this shut down 
woods incurred million in severance  pension  and other employee related costs associated with the employee terminations 
woods also incurred a charge for the creation of a liability for non cancelable lease costs at abandoned production facilities of million 
an additional million of other exit costs were incurred related to facility repairs and other minor costs 
woods also incurred million of inventory write offs related to raw and packaging materials that will not be utilized efficiently with the change over to a fully sourced inventory strategy 
contico incurred restructuring costs of million associated with costs of revaluing their non cancelable lease liability at the warson road and earth city facilities  and million of costs in moving inventory and equipment from the warson facility to the bridgeton facility 
during the third quarter of  we recorded million of severance  restructuring and other charges 
during the third quarter  we committed to a plan to abandon contico s earth city  missouri distribution facility  and to consolidate its operations into the bridgeton  missouri facility both facilities are in the st 
louis  missouri area 
as a result  a million charge was recorded to accrue a liability for non cancelable lease payments associated with the earth city facility 
also during the third quarter  the contico business recorded a million charge related to rent and other facility costs associated with its warson road facility also in the st 
louis  missouri area  whose operations are also being consolidated into bridgeton  missouri

the contico business recorded related charges of million incurred in moving inventory and equipment from the warson road facility to bridgeton  missouri  and million in severance costs 
the corporate group recorded a million charge for non cancelable lease payments related to the former corporate headquarters 
also in the third quarter of  a charge of million was recorded for payments to consultants working with us on sourcing and other manufacturing and production efficiency initiatives 
certain assumptions have been made regarding potential future sub lease revenue at rented facilities that have been  or will be  abandoned as a result of restructuring and consolidation activities 
if we are unable to achieve our estimated sub lease revenue estimates  charges could be recognized in future periods to update the estimated liability and cost to katy for these facilities 
during the second quarter of  we recorded million of severance  restructuring  and other charges 
approximately million of the charges related to accruals for payments to consultants working with us on sourcing and other manufacturing and production efficiency initiatives 
additionally  net non cancelable rental payments of million associated with the shut down of contico s warson road facility in st 
louis  missouri were accrued at june   as well as involuntary termination benefits of million 
the warson road facility shutdown involves a reduction in workforce of nineteen employees 
the remaining million was for involuntary termination benefits related to sesco and for various integration costs in the consolidation of administrative functions into st 
louis  missouri  from various operating divisions in the maintenance products group 
during the first quarter of  we recorded million of severance  restructuring and other charges 
approximately million of the charges related to accruals for payments to consultants working with us on sourcing and other manufacturing and production efficiency initiatives 
approximately million related to involuntary termination benefits for two management employees whose positions were eliminated  and million were costs associated with the consolidation of administrative and operational functions 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of severance and restructuring charges 
approximately million was related to severance payments

during the first quarter of  woods undertook a restructuring effort that involved reductions in senior management headcount as well as facility closings 
we closed facilities in loogootee and bloomington  indiana  as well as the hong kong office of katy international  a subsidiary which coordinates sourcing of products from asia 
sixteen management and administrative employees received severance packages 
total involuntary severance benefits were million and other exit costs were million 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company implemented a workforce reduction that reduced headcount by approximately employees affected were primarily in general and administrative functions  with the largest number of affected employees coming from the maintenance products group 
the workforce reduction included severance and related costs for certain employees 
total severance and related costs was million 
the table below details activity in restructuring reserves since december restructuring liabilities at december   additions to restructuring liabilities  payments on restructuring liabilities  restructuring liabilities at december   additions to restructuring liabilities  payments on restructuring liabilities  restructuring liabilities at december   the table below summarizes the future obligations for severance and restructuring charges detailed above thereafter  total payments  outlook for we anticipate a continuation of the difficult economic conditions and business environment in  which will present challenges in maintaining net sales 
in particular  we expect to see softness continue in the restaurant  travel and hotel markets to which we sell cleaning products 
however  we began to see some improvement in this channel as progressed 
we have also seen strong sales performance from the woods and woods canada retail electrical corded products business  but we do not expect to see the same level of top line growth from those businesses in we have a significant concentration of customers in the mass market retail  discount and do it yourself market channels 
our ability to maintain and increase our sales levels depends in part on our ability to retain and improve relationships with these customers 
we face the continuing challenge of recovering or offsetting cost increases for raw materials 
gross margins are expected to improve during as we realize the benefits of various profit enhancing strategies begun in and these strategies include sourcing previously manufactured products  as well as locating new sources for products already sourced outside the company 
we have significantly reduced headcount  and continue to examine issues related to excess facilities 
cost of goods sold is subject to variability in the prices for certain raw materials  most significantly thermoplastic resins used by contico in the manufacture of plastic products 
prices of plastic resins  such as polyethylene and polypropylene  have increased during the early months of management has observed that the prices of plastic resins are driven to an extent by prices for crude oil and natural gas  in addition to other factors specific to the supply and demand of the resins themselves 
we cannot predict the longevity of the current price increase  or if resin prices may increase further or be reduced through the rest of we are also exposed to price changes for copper a primary material in many of the products sold by woods and woods canada  corrugated packaging material and other raw materials 
copper prices have also increased in recent months 
we have not employed an active hedging program related to our commodity price risk  but are employing other strategies for managing this risk 
in a climate of rising raw material costs  we experience difficulty in raising prices to shift these higher costs to our customers 
depreciation expense is expected to be higher during as a result of the reduction in depreciable lives for certain assets used in contico s manufacturing process 
however  many of these assets will become fully depreciated during since the contico acquisition occurred in early therefore  depreciation expense is expected to reduce again in and subsequent years 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to remain stable as a percentage of sales from levels 
cost reduction efforts are ongoing throughout the company 
our corporate office has relocated  and we expect to maintain modest headcount and rental costs for that office 
we have completed the process of transferring most back office functions of our wilen subsidiary from atlanta  georgia to st 
louis  missouri  the headquarters of contico 
we are nearly complete with the process of transferring most back office functions of the glit microtron subsidiary in wrens  georgia to st 
louis  missouri 
we will evaluate the possibility of further consolidation of administrative processes at our subsidiaries 
we have announced or committed to several restructuring plans involving our operations 
during the second and third quarters of  respectively  we announced plans to consolidate the warson and earth city facilities of contico into the bridgeton facility 
all of these facilities are located in the st 
louis  missouri area 
the move from our warson road facility is complete 
the move from our earth city facility will require approximately million of incremental cash  million in the form of capital expenditures  mainly for material handling equipment  and million to move inventory and equipment 
this cash will be spent in the large expense charges recorded during the second and third quarters of related to these facilities were mainly to accrue non cancelable lease payments for these facilities ie  non incremental cash 
we expect the contico business unit to benefit from significantly lower overhead costs in and beyond as a result of these consolidations 
further facility consolidations with respect to the contico operations are under review 
during october  we also announced the planned closure of four woods manufacturing facilities in indiana  necessitated by our decision to fully outsource our supply of electrical consumer corded products to lower cost sources 
prior to the plant closures  woods already sourced approximately half of its finished goods from vendors 
the plant closures took place in december while outsourcing of the woods products is a cost saving measure  woods expects to maintain higher inventory levels  especially during mid  as a result of this move 
we have committed to other restructuring alternatives as well  most of which center around consolidation of operations into fewer facilities 
certain of these projects under consideration could require more significant levels of incremental cash for both capital expenditures and moving and relocation costs 
expected capital needs for these projects may reach million  which would be spent mainly in early to mid we continue to pursue a strategy of developing the katy maintenance group kmg 
by the latter portion of  we expect to have operational centralized customer service functions for continental  glit  wilen and disco  allowing customers to order products from any division on one purchase order 
we believe that operating these businesses as a cohesive unit will improve customer service in that our customers purchasing processes will be simplified  as will follow up on order status  billing  collection and other related functions 
we hope that these steps will increase customer loyalty and help in attracting new customers and increasing top line sales in future years 
interest expense in is expected to be stable to lower than the amount reported in  due primarily to similar or lower expected debt balances 
we cannot predict the future levels of interest rates 
regarding income tax expense  we did not record the net benefit of any deferred tax benefits as of december  given our history of operating losses  along with guidance provided by the accounting literature covering accounting for income taxes  we were unable to conclude it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate future taxable income sufficient to realize the benefits of deferred tax assets carried on our books 
therefore  a full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax asset position was recorded at december  therefore  we do not expect to record the benefit of any losses or deferred tax assets that may be generated in we are continually evaluating alternatives relating to divestitures of certain of our businesses 
divestitures present opportunities to de leverage our financial position and free up cash for further investments in core activities 
on march   we announced that we are exploring the sale of the woods and woods canada businesses 
however  there can be no assurance that a sale of the woods and woods canada business will be completed 
on april   we announced the sale of gc waldom with gross proceeds of million 
katy does not expect to record a significant gain or loss during as a result of this transaction

words and phrases such as expects  estimates  will  intends  plans  believes  anticipates and the like are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the results referred to in forward looking statements may differ materially from actual results because they involve estimates  assumptions and uncertainties 
forward looking statements included herein are as of the date hereof and we undertake no obligation to revise or update such statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
all forward looking statements should be viewed with caution 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of katy included in part ii  item certain of our accounting policies as discussed below require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating amounts to record in our financial statements 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payment from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provision established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of large sized customers  especially our consumer retail customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
our accounting policies state that operating divisions are to identify  at a minimum  those inventory items that are in excess of either one year s historical or one year s forecasted usage  and to use business judgment in determining which is the more appropriate metric 
those inventory items must then be evaluated on a lower of cost or market basis for realizability 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or product developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were million and million  respectively  as of december  and december  impairments of long lived assets we regularly review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets that are to be held and used  this is done by comparing undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset or asset group and determining if the carrying value of the asset asset group will be recovered by those cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset or of the primary asset of an asset group 
if the future undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of the asset asset group will not be recovered  then the asset is marked to fair value 
we monitor our operations to look for triggering events that may cause us to perform an impairment analysis 
these events include  among others  loss of product lines  poor operating performance and abandonment of facilities 
we determine the lowest level at which cash flows are separately identifiable to perform the future cash flows tests  and apply the results to the assets related to those separately identifiable cash flows 
in some cases  this may be at the individual asset level  but in other cases  it is more appropriate to perform this testing at a business unit level especially when poor operating performance was the triggering event 
for assets that are to disposed of by sale or by a means other than by sale  the identified asset or disposal group if a group of assets or entire business unit is marked to fair value less costs to sell 
in the case of the planned sale of a business unit  sfas no 
indicates that disposal groups should be reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated financial statements if cash flows of the disposal group are separately identifiable 
sfas no 
has had an impact on the application of accounting for discontinued operations  making it in general much easier to classify a business unit disposal group held for sale as a discontinued operation 
the rules covering discontinued operations prior to sfas no 
generally required that an entire segment of a business be planned for disposal in order to classify it as a discontinued operation 
we recorded significant impairments of long lived assets during in accordance with sfas no 
 which are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item we also recorded amounts as discontinued operations in and for all periods presented  which are detailed further in note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets also include federal  state and foreign net operating loss carry forwards  primarily due to the significant operating losses incurred during recent years  as well as various tax credits 
we regularly review our deferred income tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration historical net income losses  projected future income losses and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that these assets will not be recovered 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million 
during the year ended december   we increased the valuation allowance by million primarily to provide a full reserve against our net deferred tax asset position 
given the negative evidence provided by our history of operating losses  and considering guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we were unable to conclude that our deferred tax assets would be recoverable through the generation of future taxable income 
we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance requirements based on future operating results and business acquisitions and dispositions  and we may adjust our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
such changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance will be reflected in current operations through our income tax provision 
workers compensation and product liabilities we make payments for workers compensation and product liability claims generally through the use of a third party claims administrator 
we have purchased insurance coverage for large claims over our self insured retention levels 
our workers compensation and health benefit liabilities are developed using actuarial methods based upon historical data for payment patterns  cost trends  and other relevant factors 
in order to consider a range of possible outcomes  we have estimated our liabilities in this area on several different sources of loss development factors  including those from the insurance industry  the manufacturing industry  and factors developed in house 
our general approach is to identify a reasonable  logical conclusion  typically in the middle range of the possible outcomes 
while we believe that our liabilities for workers compensation and product liability claims as of december   are adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated liabilities could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life  but will be tested for impairment on an annual basis and whenever indicators of impairment arise 
the goodwill impairment test  which is based on fair value  is to be performed on a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment determined in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or one level lower 
goodwill will no longer be allocated to other long lived assets for impairment testing under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
additionally  goodwill on equity method investments will no longer be amortized  however  it will continue to be tested for impairment in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
under sfas no 
intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized 
instead they will be carried at the lower of cost or fair value and tested for impairment at least annually or when indications of impairment arise 
all other recognized intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  although goodwill on business combinations consummated after july  will not be amortized 
the company has adopted the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
with regards to goodwill that has been reported on the balance sheets historically 
the amount of goodwill amortization not recorded during the twelve months ended december  as a result of the adoption of the non amortization provisions was million  before tax 
negative goodwill  which was created with the acquisition of woods industries in december and was amortized over five years  was fully amortized by december   therefore  the adoption of the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
had no impact on negative goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of katy included in part ii  item for further discussion of the final transition to sfas no 
in august  the fasb released sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
previously  two accounting models existed for long lived assets to be disposed of  as sfas no 
did not address the accounting for a segment of a business accounted for as a discontinued operation under apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
this statement establishes a single model based on the framework of sfas no 
this statement also broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
katy anticipates that the implementation of sfas no 
could have a future impact on its financial reporting as katy is considering divestitures of certain businesses and exiting certain facilities and operational activities  the statement broadens the presentation of discontinued operations  and the company anticipates that impairments of long lived assets may be necessitated as a result of the above contemplated actions 
if certain divestitures occur  they may qualify as discontinued operations under sfas no 
 whereas they would not have met the requirements of discontinued operations treatment under apb opinion however  the company is not able to conclude that it is probable that these divestitures will occur within one year  and recognizes that significant changes to plans or intentions may occur 
therefore  these operations have not been classified as discontinued operations 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements of katy included in part ii  item for further discussion of impairments and discontinued operations 
in april  the fasb released sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds and makes technical corrections regarding various topics  including early extinguishments of debt and sale leaseback transactions 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we intend to adopt sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
will require that certain costs and losses associated with early extinguishments of debt be reported as interest expense as a component of income from continuing operations  whereas the prior accounting guidance provided for classification so these costs and losses as extraordinary items  reported separate on a tax effected basis after income from continuing operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
will require that we reclassify a million after tax million pre tax write off of previously capitalized debt costs that occurred during to interest expense in income from continuing operations during  as opposed to its previous classification as an extraordinary item 
future write offs of capitalized debt costs would be classified in interest expense in a similar manner 
we anticipate writing off approximately million of debt costs  pre tax  during the first quarter of  associated with the refinancing of our debt obligations through the fleet credit agreement 
these costs will be reported as interest expense as a component of income from continuing operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
previous accounting guidance was provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
replaces eitf issue no 
the new standard is effective for exit or restructuring activities initiated after december  we are considering a number of restructuring and exit activities at the current time  including plant closings and consolidation of facilities 
since these activities will be initiated after december   this statement could have a significant impact on the timing of the recognition of these costs in our statements of operations  tending to spread the costs out as opposed to recognition of a large portion of the costs at the time we commit to and communicate such restructuring and exit plans 
katy is required to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
in our operating plans call for additional restructuring and facility consolidation activity during and  concerned mainly with further consolidation of st 
louis  missouri plastics manufacturing facilities  and restructuring and consolidation of certain abrasives manufacturing facilities 
current estimates indicate million to million will be expensed in and associated with these activities 
the largest share of these costs would have been expensed as incurred under either the old or new rules  as they pertain to moving of inventory and equipment  and cleaning and refurbishing facilities 
the new rules could potentially push the recognition of a portion of the costs  related to an estimated million non cancelable lease liability  from to  since the facility would probably not be abandoned until in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we are currently evaluating the interpretation and determining the impact that this interpretation could have on certain disclosures made regarding katy s guarantees  especially those involving sesco 
in january  the fasb released interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
the interpretation clarifies issues regarding the consolidation of entities which may have features that make it unclear whether consolidation or equity method accounting is appropriate 
fin is generally effective in katy is evaluating fin to determine any potential impact on its financial reporting 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based methods of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the new standard is effective for fiscal years ending after december katy will continue to comply with the provisions under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  for accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
have been reflected in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item environmental and other contingencies the company and certain of its current and former direct and indirect corporate predecessors  subsidiaries and divisions are involved in remedial activities at certain present and former locations and have been identified by the epa  state environmental agencies and private parties as potentially responsible parties prps at a number of hazardous waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund act or equivalent state laws and  as such  may be liable for the cost of cleanup and other remedial activities at these sites 
responsibility for cleanup and other remedial activities at a superfund site is typically shared among prps based on an allocation formula 
under the federal superfund statute  parties could be held jointly and severally liable  thus subjecting them to potential individual liability for the entire cost of cleanup at the site 
based on its estimate of allocation of liability among prps  the probability that other prps  many of whom are large  solvent  public companies  will fully pay the costs apportioned to them  currently available information concerning the scope of contamination  estimated remediation costs  estimated legal fees and other factors  the company has recorded and accrued for indicated environmental liabilities amounts that it deems reasonable and believes that any liability with respect to these matters in excess of the accrual will not be material 
the ultimate costs will depend on a number of factors and the amount currently accrued represents management s best current estimate of the total cost to be incurred 
the company expects this amount to be substantially paid over the next one to four years 
the most significant environmental matter in which the company is currently involved relates to the wj smith site 
in  the epa initiated a unilateral administrative order proceeding under section of the rcra against wj smith and katy 
the proceeding requires certain actions at the wj smith site and certain off site areas  as well as development and implementation of additional cleanup activities to mitigate off site releases 
in december  wj smith  katy and usepa agreed to resolve the proceeding through an administrative order on consent under section of rcra 
pursuant to the order  wj smith is currently implementing a cleanup to mitigate off site releases 
in december  banco del atlantico  a bank located in mexico  filed a lawsuit against woods  a subsidiary of katy  and against certain past and then present officers and directors and former owners of woods  alleging that the defendants participated in a violation of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations rico act involving allegedly fraudulently obtained loans from mexican banks  including the plaintiff  and money laundering of the proceeds of the illegal enterprise 
all of the foregoing is alleged to have occurred prior to katy s purchase of woods 
the plaintiff also alleged that it made loans to an entity controlled by certain past officers and directors of woods based upon fraudulent representations 
the plaintiff seeks to hold woods liable for its alleged damages directly  and under principles of respondeat superior and successor liability 
the plaintiff is claiming damages in excess of million and is requesting treble damages under rico 
because certain threshold procedural and jurisdictional issues have not yet been fully adjudicated in this litigation  it is not possible at this time for the company to reasonably determine an outcome or accurately estimate the range of potential exposure 
katy may have recourse against the former owner of woods and others for  among other things  violations of covenants  representations and warranties under the purchase agreement through which katy acquired woods  and under state  federal and common law 
in addition  the purchase price under the purchase agreement may be subject to adjustment as a result of the claims made by banco del atlantico or other issues relating to the litigation 
the extent or limit of any such adjustment cannot be predicted at this time 
an adverse judgment in this matter could have a material impact on katy s liquidity and financial position if the company were not able to exercise recourse against the former owner of woods 
katy also has a number of product liability and workers compensation claims pending against it and its subsidiaries 
many of these claims are proceeding through the litigation process and the final outcome will not be known until a settlement is reached with the claimant or the case is adjudicated 
the company estimates that it can take up to years from the date of the injury to reach a final outcome on certain claims 
with respect to the product liability and workers compensation claims  katy has provided for its share of expected losses beyond the applicable insurance coverage  including those incurred but not reported to the company or its insurance providers  which are developed using actuarial techniques 
such accruals are developed using currently available claim information  and represent management s best estimates 
the ultimate cost of any individual claim can vary based upon  among other factors  the nature of the injury  the duration of the disability period  the length of the claim period  the jurisdiction of the claim and the nature of the final outcome 
although we believe that these actions individually and in the aggregate are not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company  further costs could be significant and will be recorded as a charge to operations when such costs become probable and reasonably estimable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk associated with changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations and a preferred interest in one of our subsidiaries which was redeemed as of february  
we currently do not use derivative financial instruments relating to this exposure 
our interest obligations on outstanding debt at december   were indexed from short term eurodollar rates 
the following table presents as of december   our financial instruments  rates of interest and indications of fair value expected maturity dates thousands of dollars assets thereafter total fair value temporary cash investments fixed rate average interest rate indebtedness fixed rate debt average interest rate variable interest rate    average interest rate preferred interest of subsidiary fixed rate obligation    average interest rate on february   the company refinanced its variable interest rate indebtedness and entered into the fleet credit agreement 
the fleet credit agreement provides for a million term loan  with quarterly payments of million  and a million final payment in the remainder of the borrowings are covered under a revolving credit facility 
rates of interest are variable and are based on short term libor rates 
therefore  we expect that the fair value of this indebtedness in future periods will approximate its carrying value 
coincident with this transaction  the company redeemed early  at a discount  the remaining preferred interest in contico  which  as disclosed above  had a stated value of million 
katy utilized approximately million plus million for payment of accrued distributions of the proceeds from the fleet credit agreement funding for this purpose 
therefore  it was determined that the fair value of this instrument at december   was million
