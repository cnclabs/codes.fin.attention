item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations applied develops  manufactures  markets and services semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor industry 
demand for applied s products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors  including  but not limited to  changes in global economic conditions  supply and demand for semiconductors  the profitability of semiconductor manufacturers  advanced technology and or capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers  and relative competitiveness of applied s products and services 
for this and other reasons  applied s results of operations for fiscal  and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
effective the first fiscal quarter of  applied implemented the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no

for periods prior to fiscal  data was not available to provide pro forma information as if the change in accounting principle were applied retroactively 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net sales applied s business was subject to cyclical industry conditions in fiscal  and as a result of these conditions  there were significant fluctuations in applied s quarterly new orders and net sales  both within and across fiscal years 
demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors  including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes 
quarterly financial information follows fiscal quarter fisca l first second third fourth year in millions  except per share amounts new orders      net sales      gross margin     net income  earnings per diluted share

net income included one time items  on an after tax basis  of million of income for the second fiscal quarter of income loss from operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle included one time expenses  on an after tax basis  of million for the second fiscal quarter of  million for the third fiscal quarter of and million for the fourth fiscal quarter of net income loss included one time expenses  on an after tax basis  of million for the first fiscal quarter of in addition to the net one time items included in income loss from operations before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net income loss also included an after tax expense of million from a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the first fiscal quarter of net sales by geographic region were as follows fiscal year ended in millions north america    taiwan    japan   europe   korea asia pacific primarily the united states 
includes china in fiscal  the semiconductor and semiconductor manufacturing equipment industries were in a period of expansion  and applied achieved record levels of new orders  net sales and net income for this period 
however  during the first fiscal quarter of  slowing worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for manufacturing equipment 
inventory buildups in telecommunication products  slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused semiconductor companies to reevaluate their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders 
this decline in demand deepened sequentially throughout fiscal and the first fiscal quarter of into a severe industry downturn due to continued weakness in the macro economic climate and consumption of electronic goods  which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by applied s customers 
as a result of these factors  net sales declined percent from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal also included in fiscal net sales was million of revenue that was recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
net sales declined percent from billion for fiscal to billion for fiscal the decline in demand for applied s products continued into the first fiscal quarter of in the second fiscal quarter of  customers began to order equipment for mm advanced capacity to satisfy demand driven by consumer related and wireless devices 
customers ordered mm capacity for this increase in demand as their transition to mm equipment was not yet complete 
customers also continued to place technology orders to invest in mm wafer processing  copper and smaller line width technologies 
however  second quarter demand levels proved to be unsustainable as the global economic environment weakened through the middle of the year  and customers reduced their level of capacity spending accordingly while maintaining advanced technology spending 
net sales peaked in the third fiscal quarter of and flattened in the fourth fiscal quarter of included in fiscal net sales was the remaining million of revenue that was recognized as part of the cumulative effect of implementing sab gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from percent for fiscal to percent for fiscal  and to percent for fiscal during fiscal and  applied experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth 
accordingly  applied expanded its manufacturing facilities during these periods to accommodate current and anticipated growth 
the decreased business volume for fiscal and due to the industry downturn was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these facilities  resulting in lower gross margins for fiscal and the decrease in fiscal gross margin was also attributable to customer service and support activities  primarily startup costs associated with a new spare parts distribution system and excess overhead resulting from the decline in system installations 
research  development and engineering applied s future operating results depend  to a considerable extent  on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the products and services it provides 
applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in rd e to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers most advanced chip designs 
applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing in rd e  especially during industry downturns  in order to continue to offer new products and technologies 
as a result  rd e expenses remained relatively flat at billion percent of net sales for fiscal  billion percent of net sales for fiscal  and billion percent of net sales for fiscal product development cycles range from to months depending on whether the tool development is an enhancement of existing technology or a new product area 
most of applied s existing product lines are the result of internal product development activities 
in certain instances  applied acquires technologies in either existing areas of development or new product opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market for market entry and penetration 
throughout the periods covered by this report  applied has been investing in its new process module products to provide customers with a qualified  integrated and optimized production process flow for building microstructures on advanced chips 
process modules are designed to link certain applied equipment to deliver an integrated process application to the customer for wafer processing 
during fiscal  applied continued its development of technologies for copper and low k based chips and mm wafers  as well as focused efforts on the core technologies that will be required for chipmakers to begin development of nm generation devices 
areas of increased investment included maskmaking technology  metrology and inspection  ion implantation  and products for depositing and etching new materials 
in fiscal  applied invested in critical development activities to meet customers rapid move to sub nm dimensions in their most advanced designs  which are expected to begin entering production in fiscal this difficult and challenging dimensional shift is matched by the need to provide much of the technology for both mm and mm wafers  requiring additional process and hardware development 
for the sub nm chip generations  inspection and metrology tools have become more important to assure enhanced device performance as well as adequate manufacturing yields 
accordingly  applied focused its rd e resources on these technologies 
in addition  development of new technologies such as advanced wafer wet cleaning and atomic layer deposition  which deposits materials in increasingly smaller structures  addresses new market opportunities for applied in coming years 
within virtually all of the technology areas  including fab and yield management  applied invested in more advanced software capabilities 
marketing  selling  general and administrative marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from million percent of net sales for fiscal to million percent of net sales for fiscal  and to million percent of net sales for fiscal the decreases for fiscal and were due primarily to cost reduction activities limiting discretionary expenditures and to lower business volume 
non recurring items non recurring items for fiscal totaled million  or per diluted share after tax  related to merger expenses for the acquisition of etec 
non recurring items for fiscal totaled million  or per diluted share after tax  consisting of a pre tax charge of million for acquired in process research and development and pre tax restructuring charges of million 
during fiscal  applied recorded pre tax restructuring charges of million  consisting of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities and million for other costs  primarily fixed asset write offs 
these restructuring actions occurred in applied s second  third and fourth fiscal quarters  and were taken to better align applied s cost structure with prevailing market conditions 
during the second fiscal quarter of  applied completed a voluntary separation plan that resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately  employees  or three percent of its global workforce  for a cost of million 
during the third fiscal quarter of  applied recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million associated with severance and benefit costs 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  applied eliminated approximately  additional positions  or percent of its global workforce  for a cost of million 
the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara  california and austin  texas  and represented multiple company activities and functions 
non recurring items for fiscal totaled million  or per diluted share after tax  consisting of a pre tax charge of million for acquired in process research and development and a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
the pre tax restructuring charge  which was recorded in the first fiscal quarter of  consisted of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities and million for other costs  primarily fixed asset write offs 
this restructuring action was taken to better align applied s cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged industry downturn  and it reduced applied s global workforce by approximately  employees  or six percent 
the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara  california and austin  texas  and represented multiple company activities and functions 
for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
non recurring income non recurring income of million for fiscal was related to a litigation settlement with asm international  nv for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
net interest income net interest income was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase for fiscal was due primarily to higher average cash and investment balances 
the decrease for fiscal was due primarily to lower average interest rates 
provision for income taxes applied s effective income tax rate was percent for fiscal  percent for fiscal and percent for fiscal applied expected an effective rate of percent for fiscal  which decreased from the fiscal effective rate due to a shift in the geographic composition of applied s pre tax income 
the actual effective rate for fiscal of percent differed from the expected rate of percent due to the non tax deductible nature of million of acquired in process research and development expense 
applied s actual effective rate of percent for fiscal differed from the anticipated effective rate of percent primarily due to significant foreign sales corporation and extraterritorial income tax benefits 
absent these additional benefits  earnings per diluted share would have been reduced by for fiscal applied s future effective income tax rate depends on various factors  such as tax legislation  the geographic composition of applied s pre tax income  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies 
business combinations on november   applied acquired the assets of schlumberger s electron beam wafer inspection business for million in cash 
on december   applied acquired global knowledge services  inc  a provider of advanced data mining services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and efficiency  for million in cash 
on april   applied acquired electron vision corporation  a designer  manufacturer and seller of e beam stabilization and curing tools for the semiconductor  thin film head and micro fabrication industries  for million in cash 
applied also made acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal for further details  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
subsequent event on november   applied announced a headcount reduction of approximately  positions  or percent of its global workforce  in response to the continuing downturn in the semiconductor industry 
the majority of the affected employees were based in santa clara  california and austin  texas  and represented multiple company activities and functions 
as a result of these activities  applied will record a restructuring charge for the first fiscal quarter of recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

financial condition  liquidity and capital resources applied increased its cash  cash equivalents and short term investments from billion at october  to billion at october  applied has generated billion of cash from operating activities during the past three years  primarily from net income and working capital management 
applied has not undertaken any significant external financing activities for several years 
applied generated cash from operating activities of billion for fiscal  billion for fiscal and million for fiscal the primary sources of cash from operating activities have been net income  as adjusted to exclude the effect of non cash charges  and changes in working capital requirements  including accounts receivable and inventories 
applied utilized programs to sell accounts receivable of billion for fiscal  billion for fiscal and million for fiscal these receivable sales had the effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and days sales outstanding 
days sales outstanding was days at the end of fiscal  compared to days at the end of fiscal and days at the end of fiscal applied has not experienced any losses under these programs  and receivables sold under these programs have terms and credit risk characteristics similar to applied s overall receivables portfolio 
for further details regarding accounts receivable sales  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventories were reduced by million in fiscal due to lower systems inventories  partially offset by an increase in customer service spares inventories to support new mm products shipped to customers 
applied used billion of cash for investing activities for fiscal  billion for fiscal and million for fiscal capital expenditures  net of retirements  were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal year  totaling billion for the past three years 
application laboratories  equipment and related facilities comprised most of the capital spending 
the largest capital expenditure for the last three years was the construction and fit up of the maydan process module technology center where applied s demonstration laboratories for new technology applications are located 
fiscal capital expenditures also included million for the purchase of properties in santa clara  california that were previously held under a synthetic lease 
investing activities also included purchases and sales of short term investments and acquisitions of technology or of other companies to allow applied to access new market segments or emerging technology 
applied generated million of cash from financing activities for fiscal  used million for fiscal and generated million for fiscal net common stock activities issuances of common stock under employee stock plans  offset by share repurchases generated million for fiscal as a result of a significant increase in option exercises by employees  reflecting applied s higher average stock price  partially offset by stock repurchases 
during fiscal  net common stock activity used million of cash as stock repurchases increased and stock sales to employees decreased  reflecting applied s lower average stock price in fiscal during fiscal  net common stock activity generated million of cash due to stock sales to employees and lower stock repurchases 
since march  applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its stock based employee benefit and incentive plans 
financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt 
changes in debt generated million of cash for fiscal  used million of cash for fiscal and generated million of cash for fiscal to date  applied has not declared or paid cash dividends to its stockholders due to a number of factors  including the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential requirements to finance working capital in the event of a significant upturn in business 
applied reevaluates this practice from time to time but is not contemplating the payment of a cash dividend 
on march   applied s board of directors approved a two for one stock split of applied s common stock  which was distributed in the form of a percent stock dividend on or about april  to stockholders of record as of april  although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  applied s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy applied s liquidity requirements for the next months 
for further details regarding applied s operating  investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october   see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this annual report on form k 
the following table summarizes the effect on applied s liquidity and cash flows from contractual obligations of debt arrangements and noncancellable leases as of october  fiscal year ended thereafter total in millions debt maturities noncancellable operating leases critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section below entitled trends  risks and uncertainties 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and configuration experience statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  known and anticipated engineering change orders are evaluated for potential obsolescence 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is determined by an independent valuation firm based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify any potential impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value 
if a potential impairment is identified  the second step is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount to measure the impairment loss 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach  and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge to goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes applied accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
applied provides for income taxes based upon an annual estimated effective income tax rate 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions  availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of applied s tax planning strategies 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate on a timely basis 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material effect on applied s financial condition and results of operations 
trends  risks and uncertainties the industry that applied serves is highly volatile and unpredictable 
as a supplier to the semiconductor industry  applied is subject to the business cycles that characterize the industry the timing  length and volatility of these cycles are difficult to predict 
the semiconductor industry has historically been cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and capacity requirements  including capacity utilizing the latest technology 
the rate of changes in demand  including end demand  is accelerating  and the effect of these changes upon applied is occurring sooner  exacerbating the volatility of these cycles 
these changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology 
these industry cycles create pressure on applied s net sales  gross margin and net income 
in addition to affecting applied s customers and suppliers  these cycles challenge key management  engineering and other employees of applied who are vital to applied s success 
during periods of declining demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment  customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of products and or cancel orders 
during downturns  applied must be able to timely and effectively align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions  to manage its inventory levels to reduce the possibility of future inventory write downs resulting from obsolescence and liability to suppliers for order cancellations  and to motivate and retain key employees 
during periods of rapid growth  applied must be able to acquire and or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand  and to attract  hire  assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified people 
if applied is unable to achieve its objectives in a timely manner during changes in business conditions  there could be a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the semiconductor equipment industry is currently experiencing a continued and prolonged downturn 
management believes that this current downturn may be the most severe decline in history and cannot predict when a recovery will begin or what the industry s rate of growth will be in such a recovery 
applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business 
currently  percent of applied s revenues result from sales outside the us  with an increasing percentage of sales to customers headquartered in asia 
certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers are also located outside the us managing applied s global operations presents challenges  including periodic regional economic downturns  trade balance issues  varying business conditions and demands  political instability  variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract rights in different jurisdictions  differences in the ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses  changes in us and international laws and regulations including us export restrictions  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates  the ability to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations  cultural differences  shipping delays and terrorist acts or acts of war  among other risks 
many of these challenges are present in china  which represents a large potential market for semiconductor equipment and where applied anticipates significant opportunity for growth 
global uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries  sustainability of demand for electronics products  capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers  price weakness for certain semiconductor devices  and political instability in regions where applied has operations  such as israel and asia  may also affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological changes 
applied s future success depends on performing better than its competitors in a number of ways  including its ability to timely and cost effectively develop new products  services and technologies  including those utilizing new materials  such as copper  develop improvements to existing products  services and technologies  develop new markets in the semiconductor industry for its products and services  introduce new products and services to the marketplace  achieve market acceptance  qualify new or improved products for volume manufacturing with its customers  commence and adjust production to meet customer demands  and price products and services appropriately 
the development  introduction of and the ability to support an increasingly broader set of new or improved products and technologies  including those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes  new materials and mm wafers  grows increasingly complex and expensive over time 
such new or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies compared to applied s more established products and could adversely affect applied s gross margins 
if applied does not develop and introduce new or improved products  services and technologies in a timely and cost effective manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  its competitive position  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry 
ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry  including more complex technology requirements  the growth in asia  increasing pressure on semiconductor manufacturers to allocate resources to activities that enhance their competitive advantage  the increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for demand for semiconductors and the related focus on lower costs  have in turn resulted in the increasing importance of spares and service as a growing percentage of semiconductor equipment suppliers business 
these changes are also requiring semiconductor manufacturing equipment suppliers to provide increasing levels of process integration support 
if applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from these changes in the semiconductor industry  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base 
applied s customer base is highly concentrated 
orders from a relatively limited number of semiconductor manufacturers have accounted for  and likely will continue to account for  a substantial portion of applied s net sales  which may lead customers to demand pricing and other terms less favorable to applied 
in addition  sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if current customers delay  cancel or do not place orders  applied may not be able to replace these orders with new orders 
as applied s products are configured to customer specifications  changing  rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant and often non recoverable costs 
the resulting fluctuations in the amount of or terms for orders could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect applied s ability to meet customer demand 
applied s business depends on its ability to manufacture products that meet the rapidly changing demands of its customers 
applied s ability to manufacture depends in part on the timely delivery of parts  components  and subassemblies collectively parts from suppliers 
some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
significant interruptions of manufacturing operations as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts  natural disasters such as earthquakes or tornadoes  or other causes such as information technology or infrastructure failures  regional economic downturns  political instability or terrorist acts or acts of war could result in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies 
any or all of these factors could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is subject to risks of non compliance with environmental and safety regulations 
applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its business operations  including but not limited to regulations related to the development  manufacturing and use of its products 
failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities  the imposition of fines and or the suspension or termination of development  manufacturing or use of certain of its products  each of which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions 
applied has made  and may in the future make  acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  the inability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technology  and impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to multiple significant risks  and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment 
applied is subject to various risks related to new  different  inconsistent or even conflicting laws  rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and or regulatory agencies in the countries in which applied operates and with which applied must comply  and disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade 
for example  the world trade organization wto has determined that the us foreign sales corporation fsc and extraterritorial income eti exclusion constitute a prohibited export subsidy warranting the possible imposition of trade sanctions on certain goods  including semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
applied has benefited from fsc and eti tax provisions 
the elimination of these tax benefits or imposition of sanctions could materially and adversely affect applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  applied filed an application with the sec for an exemptive order confirming that it is not subject to the investment company act of the act  which requires companies primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities to comply with additional rules and regulations 
largely due to the industry downturn  applied s ratios of investments to total assets and of interest income to net income have increased  resulting in the risk that applied could be deemed to be covered by the act 
if the sec does not grant the exemption  applied may have to take other actions that could adversely affect its results of operations in order not to be subject to the act 
applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or claims 
applied currently is  and in the future may be  involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement  intellectual property rights  antitrust  environmental regulations  securities  contracts and other matters see item legal proceedings 
in addition  from time to time  applied receives notification from customers who believe that applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to infringement claims made against the customers by third parties 
these legal proceedings and claims  whether with or without merit  are time consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and divert management s attention and resources 
there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims 
in addition  applied s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented  invalidated or obsoleted by the rapid pace of technological change 
furthermore  the laws of other countries permit the protection of applied s proprietary rights to varying extents  compared to us laws 
applied s success is dependent in part upon the protection of its intellectual property rights 
infringement of applied s rights by a third party could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for applied 
if applied is not able to resolve a claim  negotiate a settlement of the matter  obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms  and or successfully prosecute or defend its position  applied s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at october   applied s investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
due to the short duration of applied s investment portfolio  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s long term debt bears interest primarily at fixed rates  therefore  applied s results of operations would be affected by interest rate changes only to the extent that variable rate short term notes payable are outstanding 
due to the short term nature and relatively insignificant amount of applied s short term notes payable  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro and british pounds 
applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied s results of operations for fiscal  or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen  euro and british pounds  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
applied s outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged  therefore  the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s downside risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option 
premiums paid for options outstanding at october  were not material
