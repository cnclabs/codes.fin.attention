item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in and prior years  the company provided systems and solutions for the intelligent transportation  electronic security and other markets 
the company s operations included the design  manufacturing  installation and support of hardware and software products utilizing the company s wireless data and security technologies 
the company determined in that the company s businesses were low margin and the markets in which they operated were approaching maturity 
accordingly  the company decided to exit its then current businesses  and during it sold all of its operating units 
the company then began evaluating new internet related business opportunities which it deemed to offer more promising prospects for growth and profitability than the previous businesses 
the company perceived a need for products and services to bring privacy  security and convenience to internet communications and since january  the company has been developing and marketing products and services that bring privacy  security and convenience to internet users 
in the first quarter of  the company began charging for the use of zixmail  its initial product in the secure e messaging space  and began focusing its sales and marketing efforts exclusively toward the business market 
in  the company significantly expanded its portfolio of commercial products and services  as detailed in item business products and services above  and rebuilt its sales and marketing work force under new executive leadership 
the foundation of the company s business model for its current set of products and services centers around the financial leverage expected to be generated by revenues that are believed to be predominantly recurring in nature and an efficient cost structure for its secure data center operations  the core of which is expected to remain relatively stable 
for financial accounting purposes  subscription fees will generally be recognized as revenue on a prorated basis over the length of the subscription period  usually one year 
subscription fees are generally expected to be collected annually at the beginning of the subscription period 
anacom communications  inc anacom  a privately held provider of real time transaction processing services to internet merchants purchased by the company in october  ceased operations in june following the unauthorized access to anacom s databases 
anacom  an independently operated subsidiary  was purchased in conjunction with the company s development of a potential product  zixcharge tm  which was never commercially released 
the cessation of the anacom operations had no effect on the company s secure e messaging services since the anacom business and technologies were not used in this part of the company s business 
operating losses and liquidity have been favorably impacted by anacom s shut down  as anacom recorded operating losses  excluding non cash charges  of  and  for and  respectively 
a development stage enterprise involves risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that the company will be successful in its efforts 
successful growth of a development stage enterprise  particularly internet related businesses  is costly and highly competitive 
the company s growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of its products and services 
in  the company had no significant revenues and utilization of cash resources continued at a substantial level 
the company anticipates further operating losses in  but expects the losses will be significantly less than those incurred in non cash charges in for stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization should be substantially less than the corresponding amounts in results of operations continuing operations revenues the company is in the development stage and had no significant revenues in  and substantially all of the company s revenues in and were generated by anacom which ceased operations in june the company first began charging for its products and services in the first quarter of subscription fees received from customers in advance are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenues ratably over the subscription period 
revenues for were primarily comprised of the amortization of subscription fees generated from us businesses and  or of annual revenues  resulting from the pro rata recognition of the future minimum payments associated with the company s marketing and distribution agreement with entrust 
entrust is scheduled to pay the company future minimum annual payments aggregating  through january  which are being recognized as revenue ratably over the four year maximum service period ending december additionally  in march  the company cancelled its agreement with computer co  ltd 
 its exclusive distributor in south korea  for failure to pay scheduled installment payments when due 
as a result  the  minimum payment previously received from was included in revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenues increased from  in to  in primarily due to a non cash charge of  for the write off of digital identification certificates in the fourth quarter of  as these certificates did not enter into the sales and marketing plans established by the company s new executive management team 
these digital identification certificates were not a component of the company s product set  and their write off had no effect on future operations 
additionally  depreciation and amortization costs increased by  from  in to  in the net decrease in cost of revenues from to of  consists primarily of the previously mentioned non recurring  non cash charge of  for the write off of digital identification certificates in and the reduction of  in non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment resulting from certain data center equipment becoming fully depreciated during in early  the company organized healthyemail  inc  a nonprofit organization established for the purpose of promoting the responsible use of email in the healthcare sector 
healthyemail  inc and the company have committed to provide zixmail licenses at no cost to physicians and two members of their office staff for a two year period to enable the healthcare industry to meet hipaa privacy requirements  which could potentially have an impact on the company s overall sales margins 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from  in to  in primarily due to increased employee compensation costs of  resulting from hiring additional technical personnel to support the development of the company s various internet products  substantially offset by reductions in third party consulting expenditures 
non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment was  and  for and  respectively 
in  research and development expenses decreased to  primarily due to continued decreases in third party consulting expenditures totaling  and reduced employee recruitment expenses of  non cash charges increased  from  in to  in due to a non recurring charge of  for the cost to license certain patents held by tumbleweed communications corp  partially offset by a  reduction in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment that became fully depreciated during selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from  in to  in and to  in the net decrease from to amounted to  expenses  excluding non cash charges  increased  in as the company increased its development stage efforts  primarily in the areas of direct sales and marketing support  as the company began commercially selling and charging for its zixmail product and related services in the first quarter of changes in expense levels between and  excluding non cash charges  included the costs for additional personnel added in totaling  and a reduction in discretionary advertising costs of  as the company re evaluated the effectiveness of certain advertising mediums previously utilized and shifted its focus to the commercial markets rather than the consumer markets 
in addition  with the closing of anacom s business mid year  selling  general and administrative expenses of anacom  excluding non cash charges  decreased from  in to  in other operating costs increased  due to increased occupancy and other costs related to the company s increased employee headcount 
non cash charges decreased from  in to  in primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation of  which included a  reversal of previously recorded unvested stock based compensation expense related to the ceasing of operations at anacom in june see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the net decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses from to amounted to  expenses  excluding non cash charges  decreased  in primarily due to reduced discretionary advertising expenditures of  resulting from the company s participation in fewer trade shows in and the april cancellation of the yahoo inc advertising commitment initiated in  all part of the company s efforts to re evaluate and redirect its advertising and marketing efforts 
also  contributing to the decrease between years were anacom expenditures of  that were eliminated in following cessation of anacom s operations in june and decreased employee recruitment expenditures of  in the third quarter of  the company established an office in ottawa  ontario canada  as a result of hiring available talent in the region to expand the company s sales and professional services capabilities 
in late  the company began expanding its marketing reach into the healthcare community by adding personnel to the sales organization 
non cash charges between and decreased by  primarily due to a decrease in stock based compensation related to stock option grants for employees and third party service providers of  partially offset by  of non recurring costs in related to yahoo inc and a non recurring reduction in expenses in of  related to anacom  which ceased operations in june investment and other income investment income decreased from  in to  in and further decreased to  in the continual decrease between years is primarily due to the decrease in invested cash and marketable securities and a continual lowering of interest rates 
interest expense interest expense incurred in totaled  resulting from the issuance of  in convertible notes 
due to a significant issuance discount on the convertible notes  primarily due to the fair value of associated warrants totaling  using the black scholes option pricing model  the company recorded a non recurring  non cash charge of  representing the beneficial conversion feature resulting from the convertible notes being convertible into  shares of common stock at an effective price less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date the convertible notes were issued 
in the fourth quarter of  the note holders converted the convertible notes and related accrued interest into  shares of the company s common stock  and the company recorded an increase to common stock and additional capital equivalent to the carrying value of the converted debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
realized and unrealized gains losses on investments realized and unrealized losses on investments in represents an impairment write down related to the company s equity investment in lante corporation lante of  representing the decline in market value that management believed was other than temporary 
in  realized and unrealized losses on investments include a realized loss of  for the disposition of the lante shares and an impairment write off of the company s  related party investment in maptuit corporation maptuit 
in october  in connection with the requirements of a  financing package executed by maptuit  the company exchanged its  debt and equity position in maptuit for  in cash  a non interest bearing  subordinated promissory note due in and two million shares of common stock of maptuit presently valued at less than 
any recovery of the company s investment in maptuit will be recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements at the time cash is received 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the income tax benefit on the loss from continuing operations in  and is different from the us statutory rate of  primarily due to unbenefitted us losses 
the company has fully reserved its net deferred tax assets in  and due to the uncertainty of future taxable income 
the  current tax benefit recorded in resulted from legislative changes extending the net operating loss carry back period from two years to five years 
there may be limitations on our ability to fully utilize our substantial net operating loss carryforwards against any future taxable income  including potential limitations due to ownership changes as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
loss from continuing operations as a result of the foregoing  the company experienced losses from continuing operations of  in   in and  in discontinued operations the company sold all of its remaining operating businesses during realizing follow on after tax gains of   and  in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s principal source of liquidity was its net working capital position of  including cash and marketable securities of  the company plans to continue to invest its excess cash primarily in short term  high grade us corporate debt securities  us government and agency securities or money market funds 
the company s loss from continuing operations included significant non cash expenses  aggregating  primarily consisting of depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
net cash used by continuing operations in  and totaled   and  respectively  primarily representing continued development and operating costs relating to establishing the company s internet related business 
the reduction in was primarily due to lower selling  general and administrative expenses discussed above 
the company currently has no significant revenues and utilization of cash resources continues at a substantial level 
the company anticipates further losses in  therefore its near term liquidity will be negatively impacted as the company continues its development stage activities 
under its reseller and distributor agreements with entrust and alphaomega soft co  ltd  the company expects to receive minimum payments of  through january  including  in during  and purchases of property and equipment totaled   and  respectively 
the recent trend for a reduced level of additions to property and equipment is expected to reverse in as the company upgrades certain computer hardware in its data center and acquires computer equipment to satisfy customer orders for the company s products and services  primarily zixvpm and zixworks 
in september  we completed a capital funding for  through the issuance of  of convertible notes and associated warrants   of series a convertible preferred stock and associated warrants and  of series b convertible preferred stock and associated warrants 
in the fourth quarter of  all of the convertible notes were converted into  shares of our common stock and  in convertible preferred stock was converted into shares of our common stock 
at december   the remaining securities were convertible and exercisable  in the aggregate  into approximately  shares of our common stock 
upon the occurrence of certain events  the company is either permitted or required to redeem outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock for cash rather than issue additional shares of its common stock 
separately  at december   there are additional outstanding warrants and stock options to acquire approximately  shares of the company s common stock  which if exercised would result in a significant level of new funding for the company 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our future cash requirements depend primarily on the market acceptance of our products and services and the timing and magnitude of cash flows generated from new customer orders 
cash flows will also be impacted by capital expenditure requirements  resources devoted to the additional development of our products and services and resources devoted to sales and marketing including discretionary advertising initiatives 
the company expects the market for its products and services to expand as the business community sees the importance of privacy and security for their email communications 
however  at least as long as the company has no significant revenues  the company will need to raise additional funds to sustain its operations or initiate reductions in operating expenses  or both 
the company currently has substantial flexibility in its cost structure 
we will continue to consider various capital funding alternatives in order to strengthen our financial position 
these capital funding alternatives could involve one or more types of equity securities  including convertible debt  common or convertible preferred stock and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
such equity securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our shares of common stock 
additionally  the company is considering lease financing options for its increased computer equipment needs 
the company currently has no existing borrowings or credit facilities 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to raise additional capital on satisfactory terms if and when needed 
critical accounting policies in preparing its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  the company must make a variety of estimates that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
the following accounting policies are currently considered most critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements software development costs costs incurred in the development and testing of software used in the company s internet products and services related to research  project planning  training  maintenance and general and administrative activities  and overhead costs are expensed as incurred 
the costs of relatively minor upgrades and enhancements to the software are also expensed as incurred 
certain costs incurred during software application development  including costs of materials  services and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly associated with the development project  qualify for capitalization 
due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future net revenues to be generated from the company s internet products and services  all development costs incurred through december  have been expensed and are included in research and development expenses 
property and equipment at december   approximately of the company s total assets consisted of property and equipment 
the net book value of property and equipment totaled  of which  was related to equipment in the zixsecure center 
the data center equipment is being depreciated over a three year useful life 
management performs periodic reviews of the carrying value of the data center equipment 
to date  no impairment write downs have been recorded on the data center equipment as it continues to be used in pursuit of the company s business goals  and such equipment is believed to have alternative uses which would allow the company to realize its carrying value 
if the company s plans change for the use of this equipment and if such alternative future uses change  the company may be required to record an impairment charge 
revenue recognition to date  the company s revenues from secure e messaging services have been derived principally from subscription fees generated from us businesses and revenues resulting from the pro rata recognition of the future minimum payments associated with the company s marketing and distribution agreement with entrust 
subscription fees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenues ratably over the subscription period 
under arrangements with resellers and distributors  revenue will generally be recognized as the company provides the related services 
determination of the timing of revenue recognition will be dependent on terms and conditions specified in individual contracts and could involve a significant level of judgment 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability be recognized for restructuring costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
sfas also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities and is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with earlier adoption encouraged 
however  the company does not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on its results of operations or its financial position 
risks and uncertainties as a development stage company  we have no significant revenues  and we continue to use significant amounts of cash 
since we have been developing and marketing products and services that bring privacy  security and convenience to internet users 
successful development of a development stage enterprise is costly and highly competitive 
a development stage enterprise involves risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts 
we currently have no significant revenues and utilization of cash resources continues at a substantial level 
the company anticipates further losses in the market may not broadly accept our products and services  which would prevent us from operating profitably 
we must be able to achieve broad market acceptance for our products and services in order to operate profitably 
we have not yet been able to do this 
to our knowledge  there are currently no secure e messaging management and protection businesses similar to ours  that currently operate at the scale that we would require  at our current expenditure levels and proposed pricing  to become profitable 
there is no assurance that our products and services will become generally accepted or that they will be compatible with any standards that become generally accepted  nor is there any assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate profitably 
competition in the secure e messaging business is expected to increase  which could cause our business to fail 
our solutions are targeted to the secure e messaging management and protection services market 
although there are many large  well funded participants in the information technology security industry  few currently participate in the secure e messaging management and protection services market 
our primary competitors in this market are tumbleweed communications  sigaba corporation  authentica  postx  critical path  clearswift  brightmail  frontbridge and messagelabs 
we believe that the secure e messaging management and protection services market is immature  and  for the most part  unpenetrated  unlike many segments of the information technology security industry which are saturated 
after several years of infrastructure development and product development  we believe that we are the only provider that has made the investments necessary to successfully penetrate the relatively untapped secure e messaging management and protection services market 
we do not believe that our primary competitors have made the infrastructure and development investments required to match our service offerings 
nevertheless  others may  over time  make the necessary investments in infrastructure and service offerings 
these competitors may develop new technologies that are perceived as being more secure  effective or cost efficient than our own 
if we are not successful in exploiting the technology advantage we believe we currently hold  these competitors could successfully garner a significant share of the market  to the exclusion of zixcorp 
furthermore  increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins or the failure of our business to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could harm our business 
our inability to develop and introduce new products and related services and to implement technological changes could harm our business 
the emerging nature of the secure e messaging management and protection services business and its rapid evolution  require us continually to develop and introduce new products and services and to improve the performance  features and reliability of our existing products and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
to date  we have achieved no significant revenues from the sale of any of our products and related services 
we also have under development new feature sets for our current product line and are considering new secure e messaging products 
the success of new or enhanced products and services depends on several factors primarily  market acceptance 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing new or enhanced products and services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 
this could harm our business 
if the market for secure e messaging management and protection services does not continue to grow  demand for our products and services will be adversely affected 
the market for secure internet e messaging is at an early stage of development 
continued growth of the secure e messaging management and protection services market will depend to a large extent on the market recognizing the need for secure e messaging communications 
failure of this market to grow could reduce demand for our products and services  which would harm our business 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project  and we may not be able to expand and upgrade our systems to meet increased use  which would result in reduced revenues 
while we have ample through put capacity to handle our customers requirements for the medium term  at some point we may be required to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage on our network 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and upgrade  in a timely manner  our systems and network hardware and software capabilities to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
if we do not timely and appropriately expand and upgrade our systems and network hardware and software  we may lose customers and revenues 
security interruptions to our secure data center could disrupt our business  and any security breaches could expose us to liability and negatively impact customer demand for our products and services 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our secure data center 
we must protect this center from loss  damage or interruption caused by fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other events beyond our control 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our secure data center operations could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to issue digitally signed certified time stamps and public encryption codes in connection with our products and services depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections between customers and our data center 
we depend on internet service providers efficiently operating these connections 
these providers have experienced periodic operational problems or outages in the past 
any of these problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction 
furthermore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and the market perceives them to be secure 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
in addition  we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data  resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events  therefore  it is possible that we may have to use additional resources to address these problems 
messages sent through our zixport and zixmessage center messaging portals will reside  for a user specified period of time  in our secure data center network 
any physical or electronic break ins or other security breaches or compromises of this information could expose us to significant liability  and customers could be reluctant to use our internet related products and services 
we determined in june that credit card databases at our independently operated subsidiary  anacom  had been improperly accessed 
as a result of this improper access  we shut down the anacom operations and anacom ceased doing business 
the zixmail and zixmessage center systems and our secure data center operations were entirely separate from the systems operated by anacom 
no zixcorp technologies or operations were involved in the incident  nor are the anacom technologies involved being used in our zix family of secure e messaging products and services 
accordingly  this breach has not had  and will not have  any effect on the development and deployment of our secure e messaging products and related services 
no claims have been asserted against us with respect to this incident 
we are unable to assess the amount of liability  if any  to anacom or us  which may result from any claims that may be asserted 
we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our products and services  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend our intellectual property rights or defend against claims that we are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing products or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to develop or license the necessary technology 
furthermore  it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property  thus enabling them to effectively compete against us 
our products and services could contain unknown defects or errors 
we subject our products and services to quality assurance testing prior to product release 
to date  we have not become aware after product release of any defect or error that materially affects their functionality 
nevertheless  our products and services could contain undetected defects or errors 
this could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs 
any of these could prevent us from implementing our business model and achieving the revenues we need to operate profitably 
public key cryptography technology is subject to risks 
our products and services employ  and future products and services may employ  public key cryptography technology 
with public key cryptography technology  a public key and a private key are used to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends  in large measure  on the integrity of the private key  which is dependent  in part  on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the integrity of the private key is predicated on the assumption that it is difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
should methods be developed that make it easier to derive the private key  the security of encryption products using public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated and such products could become unmarketable 
this could require us to make significant changes to our products  which could damage our reputation and otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  there have been public reports of the successful decryption of certain encrypted messages 
this  or related  publicity could adversely affect public perception of the security afforded by public key cryptography technology  which could harm our business 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team including our chairman  president and chief executive officer  john a 
ryan  and his direct reports and other key employees  particularly highly skilled technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate these individuals 
there are no binding agreements with any of our employees which prevent them from leaving zixcorp at any time 
there is competition for these personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate key employees could harm our business 
we could be affected by government regulation 
exports of software products using encryption technology are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our products to almost all countries in the world  the list of countries to which our products cannot be exported could be revised in the future 
furthermore  some foreign countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption products  such as our products 
failure to obtain the required governmental approvals would preclude the sale or use of our products in international markets 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
also  the market prices of securities of other internet related companies have been highly volatile and  as is well known  have generally declined substantially and broadly 
our directors and executive officers own a substantial percentage of our securities 
their ownership could allow them to exercise significant control over corporate decisions and to implement corporate acts that are not in the best interests of our shareholders as a group 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own shares of our securities that represent approximately of the combined voting power eligible to vote on matters brought before our shareholders  including securities and associated warrants beneficially owned by antonio r 
sanchez  jr  a director and current beneficial owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock  and john a 
ryan  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
also  mr 
sanchez and mr 
ryan collectively beneficially own approximately of the series a convertible preferred stock 
the consent of the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock  voting separately as a class  is required before we may enter into mergers or other business combination transactions 
therefore  our directors and executive officers  if they acted together  could exert substantial influence over matters requiring approval by our shareholders 
these matters would include the election of directors and  as noted above  the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
this concentration of ownership and voting power may discourage or prevent someone from acquiring our business 
a private investor owns a large percentage of our outstanding stock and could significantly influence the outcome of actions 
george w 
haywood  a private investor  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
furthermore  mr 
haywood and an ira for the benefit of mr 
haywood beneficially own approximately of our series b convertible preferred stock 
the consent of the holders of the series b convertible preferred stock  voting separately as a class  is required before we may enter into mergers or other business combination transactions 
therefore  mr 
haywood could exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and  as noted above  the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
mr 
haywood s interests may not be aligned with the interests of our other shareholders 
our private placement of equity securities in could further dilute the interests of our shareholders 
in september  we completed a capital funding for  through the issuance of  of convertible notes and associated warrants   of series a convertible preferred stock and associated warrants and  of series b convertible preferred stock and associated warrants 
in the fourth quarter of  the convertible notes were converted into  shares of our common stock and  in convertible preferred stock was converted into shares of our common stock 
at december   the remaining securities were convertible and exercisable  in the aggregate  into approximately  shares of our common stock 
one ninth of the shares of our series a convertible preferred stock and our series b convertible preferred stock are to be redeemed at two month intervals beginning in may the redemption amounts payable to the holders of series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock are paid in shares of our common stock 
the value of the common stock used to determine the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon redemption of shares of series a convertible preferred stock at the final redemption date that is  september will be the lesser of per share and the market value of the common stock at the time of redemption  based on a closing bid price average formula 
if the market price of the common stock declines  the number of shares of common stock issuable to the holders of series a convertible preferred stock upon such final redemption will increase  perhaps substantially 
there is no floor on the market value calculation and  therefore  there is no ceiling on the number of shares of common stock that may be issuable by us upon the final series a convertible preferred stock redemption 
a substantial decline in the market price of the common stock would result in significant dilution to the existing holders of common stock if the series a convertible preferred stock shares are redeemed at a substantially lower price 
the value of the common stock used to determine the number of shares of common stock to be issued upon redemption of shares of series b convertible preferred stock will be the lesser of the series b conversion price and of the market value of the common stock at the time of redemption  based on a volume weighted average formula 
if the market price of the common stock declines  the number of shares of common stock issuable to the holders of series b convertible preferred stock upon such automatic redemptions will increase  perhaps substantially 
there is no floor on the market value calculation and  therefore  there is no ceiling on the number of shares of common stock that may be issuable by us upon a series b convertible preferred stock redemption 
a substantial decline in the market price of the common stock would result in significant dilution to the existing holders of common stock if the series b convertible preferred stock shares are redeemed at a substantially lower price 
the series a convertible preferred stock and the series b convertible preferred stock are convertible by the holders into shares of common stock at any time 
the series a conversion price is initially per share and the series b conversion price is initially per share 
the conversion prices could be lowered  perhaps substantially  in a variety of circumstances 
in the event we issue  or are deemed to have issued  shares of common stock at a price per share that is less than the conversion prices then in effect other than certain specified exempt issuances  the conversion prices and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock and the series b convertible preferred stock are subject to weighted average anti dilution adjustment 
these anti dilution adjustments do not have a floor that would limit reductions in the conversion price of such shares 
correspondingly  there is no ceiling on the number of shares of common stock that may be issuable following such anti dilution adjustments 
we issued four year warrants first exercisable in march to the purchasers of series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock entitling the warrant holders to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the exercise price of these warrants is subject to weighted average anti dilution adjustment in the event we issue  or are deemed to have issued  shares of common stock at a price per share that is less than the exercise price then in effect other than certain specified exempt issuances 
the floor on such anti dilution adjustments is set at per share 
we issued three year warrants the notes warrants to the holders of certain secured convertible notes issued in september subsequently converted into shares of our common stock 
the warrants entitle the holders to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the number of shares of common stock for which these warrants are exercisable and the exercise price of these warrants are subject to full anti dilution adjustment in the event we issue  or are deemed to have issued  shares of common stock at a price per share that is less than the exercise price then in effect other than certain specified exempt issuances 
these anti dilution adjustments do not have a floor that would limit reductions in the exercise price and there is no ceiling on the number of shares of common stock that may be issuable following such anti dilution adjustments 
in march  we entered into an agreement with the holders of the notes warrants  which obligates the holders  subject to certain conditions  to exercise all or any portion of these warrants on each business day following a trading day on which the weighted average market price of our common stock is at least per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current shareholders 
at some point in the foreseeable future we may determine to seek additional capital funding 
this capital funding could involve one or more types of equity securities  including convertible debt  common or convertible preferred stock and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
such equity securities could be issued at or below the then prevailing market price for our common stock 
in addition  we incentivize employees and attract new employees by issuing options to purchase our shares of common stock 
therefore  the interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted by future stock option grants to employees and any equity securities issued in capital funding financings 
stock sales and hedging activities could affect our stock price 
to the extent the holders convert  redeem and exercise  as applicable  the series a convertible preferred stock and or the series b convertible preferred stock and related warrants and then sell the shares of our common stock they receive  our stock price may decrease due to the additional amount of shares available in the market 
the subsequent sales of these shares could encourage short sales that could place further downward pressure on our stock price 
this could lead to further increases in the already large short position in our common stock  shares as of february  
moreover  subject to applicable law and limitations as set forth in the documents governing the transactions  the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock  the series b convertible preferred stock and the notes warrants may hedge their positions in our stock by shorting our stock  which could further adversely affect the stock price 
furthermore  the perception that the holders of the series a convertible preferred stock  the series b convertible preferred stock and or the notes warrants may sell our common stock short may cause others to sell their shares as well 
an increase in the volume of sales of our common stock  whether short sales or not and whether the sales are by the holders of series a convertible preferred stock  the series b convertible preferred stock and the notes warrants or others  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
the effect of these activities on our stock price could increase the number of shares required to be issued on the next applicable conversion or redemption of the series a convertible preferred stock and the series b convertible preferred stock
