item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis  and other sections of this annual report  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances 
future economic and market circumstances  industry conditions  company performance and financial results  operating efficiencies  availability and price of raw materials  availability and market acceptance of new products  product pricing  domestic and international competitive environments  actions and policy changes of domestic and foreign governments and other risks described from time to time in the company s reports to the securities and exchange commission are examples of factors  among others  that could cause results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
change change dollars in millions  except per share amounts consolidated net sales gross profit as a percent of sales sg a expense as a percent of sales operating income as a percent of sales net interest expense effective tax rate net earnings earnings per share infrastructure businesses poles segment net sales operating income wireless communication segment net sales operating income loss coatings segment net sales operating income total infrastructure businesses net sales operating income agricultural businesses irrigation segment net sales operating income tubing segment net sales operating income total agricultural businesses net sales operating income other net sales operating income loss results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated the sales decrease in as compared with was primarily due to lower sales in the wireless communication segment  offset somewhat by sales increases in the irrigation  poles and tubing segments 
the increase in gross profit as a percent of sales was due to improved margins in all segments  particularly in the irrigation segment 
margins were enhanced through improved factory productivity and cost control throughout most of our businesses 
in addition  the gross profit margin improvement was aided by a million gain on sale of a production facility in the coatings segment and the gross profit was negatively impacted by the inventory write off of million in the wireless communication segment 
hot rolled steel prices rose sharply during the first half of before prices declined somewhat in the fourth quarter 
the gross profit impact of these increases was not significant  as we were able to manage these increases through sales price increases and advance purchase contracts 
the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses was due to increases in employee incentives and a supplemental match of employee k contributions totaling million due to improved earnings and return on invested capital 
in addition  included a full year of expenses of pirod  which was acquired on march  and an increase in wind energy development expenses of million as compared with these increases were offset to some extent by the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in  when we stopped amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
the impact of sfas in was a reduction in sg a expenses of million 
net interest expense decreased significantly in  due mainly to our reduction of interest bearing debt 
we also benefited from lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the positive impact of lower interest rates was million in our effective tax rate was slightly lower in than  due to increased tax credits associated with research and development activities and the elimination of goodwill amortization 
losses in nonconsolidated subsidiaries narrowed by million  due mainly to a lower net loss in our mexican pole joint venture 
in  we recorded a million impairment charge in our investment in our irrigation distributor in argentina  due to the economic problems in the argentine economy 
in  we recognized a million impairment charge in our investment in a nonconsolidated irrigation segment operation 
this impairment charge was due to a reduced market demand for irrigation products in that operation s market area 
poles segment in north america  sales of lighting and traffic products were modestly higher as compared with government programs to develop and upgrade road  highway and traffic control systems helped support sales demand in the lighting and traffic product line 
commercial lighting sales were stable  as new alliance relationships with certain lighting fixture manufacturers offset overall weaker market demand and lower levels of commercial construction 
sales of aluminum pole products such as flag poles were improved over utility product sales in north america were lower than in  as demand for steel transmission  substation and distribution poles weakened steadily throughout utility companies and independent power producers are delaying plans to develop new electrical generation due to a slow us economy and financing constraints  which is resulting in lower demand for our products 
we entered with a large backlog in utility  which helped sustain sales through the first half of however  market conditions this year led to lower sales volumes in the second half of the year 
over the long term  we believe the key market drivers of increasing electricity consumption  overall economic growth  lack of electrical transmission capacity and deregulation of the electrical utility industry provide a solid basis for future sales 
in  rising steel prices throughout much of the year and a competitive pricing environment  especially in the utility product line in the second half of the year put some pressure on margins  but factory productivity improvements helped minimize the impact of these conditions on operating income 
sg a spending was comparable to  as lower incentive payments were offset by start up spending in our new plant in morocco and increased depreciation charges 
in europe  sales were modestly higher than in market conditions improved during the year 
we expanded our sales presence in europe and started up a factory in morocco 
profitability in europe improved mainly through improved factory performance 
in our china operation  sales were stable in china and export sales improved over profitability also improved over wireless communication segment in  sales in north america were lower than in wireless carriers and build to suit companies continue to be plagued by lack of capital and inventories of uninstalled structures 
we recognized these conditions as indications of market weakness and took actions to reduce expenses  consolidate product offerings and organize operations in line with then current market conditions 
despite the large sales decrease  operating profit only fell by million from factory costs were reduced by over and sg a spending was reduced by over this year  which helped minimize the operating income impact from the lower sales volumes 
we believe that  over time  carriers will have to add structures and antennas to improve service and keep up with the continuing growth in number of subscribers and airtime usage by subscribers 
with the cost reductions  we believe we are positioned to take advantage of the eventual recovery of this market 
in addition to reducing the cost structure of the business  this segment is using its engineering and design expertise to work with the poles segment in developing products for the sign structure business 
we have successfully delivered our first steel sign structures and are scheduled to deliver aluminum sign structures in sales of communication poles in china were slightly lower than our record sales of china  however  is continuing the buildout of its wireless phone infrastructure  which helped support sales 
this unit continues to contribute profitably to the performance of the wireless communication segment 
coatings segment sales in the coatings segment were down slightly from this business generally reflects the industrial us economy and the weak us economic growth resulted in sluggish sales 
earnings improved over due to reduced amortization of goodwill due to the adoption of sfas of million and a sale of a production facility that resulted in a gain of million 
however  fixed factory and sg a expenses continued notwithstanding the lower sales volumes  including lower sales to the poles and wireless communication segments 
the impact of these reduced sales on operating income was approximately million  but was partially offset by lower zinc and natural gas costs 
irrigation segment the increase in irrigation segment sales was due to improved market conditions in most markets 
in north america  improved crop prices and generally dry growing conditions resulted in stronger market demand for mechanized irrigation machines and related service parts 
profitability in north america improved due to sales volume increases  a stronger pricing environment  effective management of steel costs and more efficient factory performance 
sg a expenses increased approximately million as compared with due to increased compensation costs including higher employee incentives and increases in promotional spending 
international sales and profits were at record levels in  as most markets were stronger as compared with in addition to the increases in volume  profits were enhanced by improved pricing in most markets 
latin america  brazil and south africa were the main contributors to the increase in sales and profitability 
latin america sales improved due to development of new markets in the region and higher sales in mexico  which were driven by improved crop prices and government subsidies 
in brazil  sales were down due to government imposed electricity and water restrictions caused by drought 
in  these restrictions were lifted  resulting in improved market demand and pricing 
in south africa  dry growing conditions  improved crop prices and expanded sales efforts led to increased sales and profits 
our strategy of manufacturing and distribution presence in major markets has put us in a good position to compete effectively on a local basis and minimize the impacts of exchange rates on our sales and profitability 
tubing segment tubing segment product demand was similar to  due to the sluggish us industrial economy 
steel prices increased dramatically during the first half of before falling somewhat in the fourth quarter 
in addition to the effective management of higher steel prices  we were able to pass some of these price increases along to our customers  which accounted for much of the net sales increase as compared with improved factory performance and favorable product mix were the main reasons for the increase in operating income in other our other businesses include manufacture of machine tool accessories  distribution of industrial fasteners and wind energy development 
the main reason for the reduced aggregate earnings of these operations in was million spent on developing a structure for the wind energy industry  as compared with million spent in sales and profits in the machine tool accessory business were also lower than by million due to lower customer demand this year  which mainly serves the automotive industry 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated the sales increase was due to sales increases in the infrastructure businesses offset by sales decreases in the agricultural businesses 
the increase in wireless communication segment sales was attributable to the pirod acquisition  which was completed on march  in  gross profit as a percent of sales was virtually unchanged from higher margins in the poles segment essentially offset lower margins in the other segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a as a percent of sales increased in due to lower sales in the irrigation and wireless communication segments 
while expenses were reduced in these segments  sales decreased more than expenses 
the decrease in operating income was due to improved profits in the poles segment which partially offset profitability decreases in the other segments 
net interest expense was essentially unchanged between and while interest bearing debt was reduced in  average borrowing levels were higher than in the effect on interest expense from these higher borrowing levels was offset by declining interest rates throughout most of on our variable interest rate debt 
declining interest rates resulted in a positive impact on interest expense of million in our effective tax rate increased from in to in the rate increase was mainly associated with taxes related to distributions from foreign entities and increased goodwill amortization expenses that were not tax deductible 
losses in nonconsolidated subsidiaries increased in due to unprofitable operations in our mexican joint venture and an impairment charge of million in an investment in an irrigation distributor in argentina 
the mexico performance related to poor local market demand for pole products in the second half of and start up production inefficiencies 
the argentina writedown was prompted by the recent difficulties encountered in the argentine economy 
net earnings decreased to million in from million in diluted earnings per share decreased from to 
the percentage drop in earnings per share was more than the decrease in net earnings due to the additional shares outstanding in related to the shares issued as part of the pirod acquisition 
poles segment the improvement in sales and operating profit was attributable to strong performance in north america 
north america sales in lighting and traffic products were up due to government funding for the us highway program  where the emphasis on safety and traffic control drove demand for our street  area and highway lighting products as well as traffic poles and sign structures 
sales in the commercial lighting market also improved slightly over  as increased alliances with lighting fixture oem s helped maintain order rates despite a slowdown in commercial construction activity 
utility product sales also improved substantially over as electric utility companies and independent power producers have been adding new capacity  our transmission  substation and distribution poles are needed to bring this newly generated electricity from the generation source to users 
the operating profit improvement in north america was in part due to the improved sales volumes as well as margin enhancements associated with improved manufacturing productivity  stable material prices and effective utilization of capacity expansions 
we closed our composite pole facility in late  which contributed to the operating profit improvement 
this facility recorded a loss of million in in europe  lighting sales were down as compared with preparations for local elections in france increased sales early in the year  but the european economy weakened throughout the remainder of  lowering market demand for lighting structures 
despite the lower sales  operating profit was slightly improved  the result of factory and sg a expense control and improved operations 
sales and profits in china were similar to wireless communication segment the sales and operating profit of the wireless communication segment for include the operations of pirod after its acquisition at the end of the first quarter 
if pirod s sales are excluded from  worldwide sales would have been down 
sales in north america without pirod were down from  with market demand slowing more dramatically as progressed 
this was due to the general slowdown of the economy and particularly the slumping telecommunications industry  which hampered our customers ability to sustain funding of its strong network buildout of furthermore  the installation of many of the structures sold in was delayed  which also reduced demand for new structures 
sales of components  which are parts that attach antennas to structures such as poles  towers and buildings  were relatively stable 
components were used to support subscriber growth and bandwidth demand by allowing more antennas to be installed on existing structures 
this reduction in market demand for structures especially towers resulted in a drop in gross profit margins and operating income in unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost coverage in our nebraska and oregon plants due to the lower production volumes reduced operating profit by approximately million 
we elected in the fourth quarter to eliminate some overlapping product lines between the pirod and valmont microflect brands  resulting in a pretax million inventory valuation charge 
pirod was accretive to net income and neutral to earnings per share in sales of communication poles in china improved over  as a continuing wireless network buildout drove increased demand 
coatings segment the sales increase in the coatings segment related to a significant sales improvement at one location  where we provide coating and assembly services to a large customer 
aside from this location  sales were down 
furthermore  galvanizing services provided to the irrigation segment were down from  due to lower production levels in that segment and further transfer of irrigation production to its mccook  nebraska facility  which galvanizes its own production 
the reduction in operating income in mainly related to reduced fixed cost coverage due to the generally lower production levels  an operating income reduction of approximately million 
higher energy prices also negatively impacted profitability by approximately million 
irrigation segment sales in the irrigation segment were lower  both in north american and international markets 
weak commodity prices  high input costs for farmers related to energy prices and uncertainty over future us farm policy all contributed to weaker market conditions in north america 
as a result  management reduced employment and planned spending levels in early north american operating profit was down as compared to  but improved pricing discipline  customer service improvements and the spending reductions taken early in the year resulted in an improved operating profit percentage 
sales and profits in international markets were lower in  mainly due to poor market conditions in brazil 
government imposed electricity and water restrictions brought about by drought reduced farmers ability to obtain permits to irrigate  which reduced demand for irrigation machines 
the combined impact on operating profit of lower sales and margin was million 
sales and profits in other international markets in total were similar to our strategy of local manufacturing and distribution in international markets has enabled it to remain competitive  despite the continued strength of the us dollar 
tubing segment the tubing segment recorded slightly lower sales than in  due to a weaker us economy 
sales to the irrigation segment fell  due to lower irrigation sales and transfer of production to its mccook facility  which produces its own tubing 
these lower production levels resulted in unfavorable manufacturing fixed cost coverage  estimated at million 
pricing competition due to a weakening us economy and falling steel prices resulted in further margin pressure 
sg a spending was reduced in light of weaker sales and margins to mitigate the impact of lower margins on operating profit 
liquidity and capital resources general net working capital was million at fiscal year end  as compared with million at year end the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of december   as compared with at december  working capital was up due to increased inventories 
irrigation segment inventories are up due to stronger sales demand in late as compared with and anticipated sales increases in in the poles and tubing segments  we increased our stocks of hot rolled steel late in the year to guard against potential availability problems associated with turmoil in the us steel industry 
operating cash flow was million in  as compared with million in the stronger operating cash flow in related principally to substantial reductions in inventory that year  since our inventories were at relatively high levels in this inventory increase in also was the main reason for the relatively low operating cash flow in approximately million 
the average annual operating cash flow for through was approximately million 
capital spending was million in  down from the million that was spent in our depreciation and amortization expenses for and were million and million  respectively 
our capital spending is at low levels from recent history  as we have not made any substantial capacity additions in the past two years 
we made no acquisitions in in  million cash was expended as part of the pirod acquisition  which was completed on march  we do not expect that capital spending will remain at the level in the future  but we do not anticipate that capital spending will exceed depreciation expense in the foreseeable future 
we currently expect capital spending to be to million in strong operational cash flow  combined with lower capital spending and the lack of acquisitions  enabled us to reduce interest bearing debt from million at december  to million at december  we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions by a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
our long term objective is to maintain long term debt as a percent of capital below  although we may exceed that percentage from time to time for major strategic purposes  such as acquisitions 
at year end  long term debt was of invested capital  down from at year end barring significant acquisition activity  we expect that our long term debt to invested capital ratio to remain at or below in our debt financing consists of a combination of short term credit facilities and long term debt 
the short term credit facilities are with various banks and amounted to million at the ending of as compared with million at the end of on december   million of these short term credit facilities were available 
the major components of our long term debt include a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks and a long term unsecured credit facility with an insurance company 
under the revolving credit agreement  we may borrow up to million in multiple currencies 
the facility is unsecured and any outstanding principal balance is due in august the outstanding balance may be paid down at any time and additional funds may be borrowed up to the million maximum 
at december   the outstanding principal balance was million  compared with million at the end of fiscal our borrowings under the unsecured facility with an insurance company are million 
the annual principal payments due under this facility are in varying amounts starting in and ending in the principal may be prepaid at any time  subject to applicable yield maintenance provisions 
we also have certain minor long term borrowings  including capital lease arrangements 
debt covenants under the revolving credit agreement and the unsecured facility with an insurance company require us to maintain certain leverage and fixed charge ratios for the duration of the agreements 
at the end of fiscal  we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
in  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
as of december    shares had been repurchased under this authorization for a total of million 
our priorities in use of future free cash flows are as follows fund internal growth initiatives in core businesses  pay down interest bearing debt  invest in acquisitions clearly connected to our core businesses or an existing competency  and return money to our shareholders through increased dividends or common stock repurchases at appropriate share prices 
in the event of a sharp decrease in demand for our products  resulting profitability reductions would reduce our operating cash flows and affect our ability to grow 
likewise  low profitability or operating losses could impact our compliance with key long term debt covenants  which could ultimately result in default of these debt agreements and acceleration of payments due 
these factors could come from a number of sources  such as a prolonged depression in the us farm economy  a substantial reduction in government including state and local funding of the federal highway program and a prolonged us economic recession 
financial obligations and commercial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  including capital lease obligations and various operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized as follows  in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt capital leases unconditional purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consists of the revolving credit agreement and the unsecured credit facility with an insurance company 
obligations under these agreements could be accelerated in event of non compliance with loan covenants 
unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for aluminum and zinc for periods up to one year 
these obligations also include steel held by us on consignment from certain vendors 
we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
the most significant operating leases are the lease of our corporate headquarters office building in omaha  nebraska and a lease of company aircraft 
on the corporate headquarters lease  we lease the entire office complex and sublease other office space in the complex to outside parties 
the current lease obligation expires in  at which time we may elect to renew the lease at a negotiated rate and duration  purchase the facility from the bank for million  or terminate the lease 
in the event that we terminate the lease and the facility is sold for less than million  we are obligated to pay the difference between the sales price and million to the owner 
the lease of our airplane expires in our options at the end of that lease are similar to the corporate headquarters lease  except that the purchase option at the end of the lease is approximately million 
we are in the process of reviewing these leases in light of fas interpretation consolidation of variable interest entities  which was finalized in january while we have not yet completed our evaluation of these leases under the provisions of this interpretation  we may be required to capitalize one or both of the leases in our financial statements 
we have not yet determined the financial impact of this interpretation on us  but it appears that if we are required to capitalize these leases  we would record the assets and related long term debt on our balance sheet  recognize annual depreciation expense and record the lease payments as interest expense 
the pre tax impact on earnings if we are required to capitalize both leases on our financial statements would be the amount of the annual depreciation  which we estimate to be approximately million to million 
the impact of capitalizing these leases on the balance sheet would be increases in the amount of property  plant and equipment and long term debt  which would also increase our long term debt to total invested capital ratio 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us that did not meet the requirements for balance sheet recognition at yearend these commitments at december  are as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby lines of credit guarantees total commercial commitments the above commitments include in loan guarantees of non consolidated subsidiaries in argentina and mexico and are in proportion to our ownership percentage of these companies or are accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
as the likelihood of nonperformance under these commitments was not considered to be probable  they are not recognized on the balance sheet at december  changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
in  hot rolled steel prices increased significantly in the first half of the year before decreasing somewhat later in the year 
in  natural gas prices were very volatile 
our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to minimize the impact of volatility in prices and sales price increases where possible 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates we manage interest expense using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an impact on interest expense of approximately million in and million in foreign exchange exposure to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are immaterial 
we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions europe south america asia south africa outlook in  we expect the poles segment sales to be essentially flat with lighting and traffic structure sales are expected to increase  offset by lower utility structure sales 
backlogs in utility products are over lower than last year and we do not anticipate the market will improve in wireless communication sales were slow at the start of and we do not expect sales to be any better than coatings sales will follow the general industrial economy in the us  so if there is any improvement in the us economy  we should see some improvement in demand for coatings services 
irrigation sales look to be moderately improved in  as compared with overall dry growing conditions  government farm programs and improved commodity prices should result in higher sales in north america 
in the international markets  the political situation in the middle east is somewhat unknown  although war or unrest in the region would likely result in lower sales in overall  we expect to grow earnings modestly in we will continue our focus on looking for new growth opportunities through internal initiatives or acquisitions  improving our cost structure and using free cash flows to reduce interest bearing debt 
we were generally pleased with our performance in  especially in light of a difficult overall economic environment 
however  we believe there is opportunity for improvement in each of our businesses and we intend to grow and leverage our products  markets and competencies going forward 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed periodically with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information  and reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customer s financial condition were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs  costs for replacement parts  other direct costs associated with warranty claims  and the number of product units subject to warranty claims 
in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumption in our estimate is the rate we apply to those recent sales  which is based on historical claims experience 
if this estimate changed by  the impact of operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value of the majority of our inventory 
the remainder of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in  we experienced higher costs to produce inventory than in  due mainly to higher costs for steel and other commodities 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income of approximately million than if all of our inventory had been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional write downs of the inventory may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that were acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets which range from to years 
we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which coincides with our strategic planning process 
we value our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value 
the key assumptions are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under sfas  we can rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination  and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
in the case of most of our reporting units  the above criteria have been met and no further evaluation was required 
in regard to the wireless communication segment  an evaluation was performed in the third quarter of and we concluded that no impairment was evident 
we will continue to monitor the goodwill associated with the wireless communication segment 
if our assumptions about intangible assets change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe the assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
for example  in we determined through this process that the company s investment in an argentine irrigation distributor was impaired  due to recent difficulties in argentina s economy  and we wrote down the value of the investment by million 
in  we determined that our investment in an irrigation dealer in north america was impaired  which resulted in a writedown of million 
stock options our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
as allowed under generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we do not record any compensation expense on the income statement with respect to options granted to employees and directors 
alternatively  under gaap  we could have recorded a compensation expense based on the fair value of employee stock options 
as described in note in the consolidated financial statements  had we recorded a fair value based compensation expense for stock options  earnings per share would have been to less than what was reported for the  and fiscal years 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while future taxable income and tax planning strategies are considered in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if a deferred tax asset is estimated to be not fully realizable in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net income in the period the determination was made 
likewise  should we subsequently determine that we would be able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets related mainly to tax credit carryforwards that we believe do not require a valuation allowance based on the facts and circumstances available today 
if circumstances change in the future  we may be required to establish a valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase in income tax expense and a reduction in net income 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard establishes criteria for recognizing costs and liabilities related to activities such as employee termination costs  contract termination costs and costs associated with consolidating facilities and relocating employees 
specifically  costs and liabilities related to qualifying exit or disposal activities are recognized and measured at fair value when incurred  with subsequent adjustment in future periods 
this standard is applicable to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  this standard is not expected to have a significant effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin establishes disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also establishes that  for guarantees initiated after december   a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the fair value of this obligation is also required to be adjusted in the financial statements of the guarantor in subsequent periods 
we do not expect fin to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity 
the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a 
the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights b 
the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities c 
the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing the expected losses 
fin is effective for us at the beginning of the third quarter and we are in the process of evaluating the impact of this interpretation on our financial statements 
fin could result in us capitalizing our leases on the corporate headquarters office building and company aircraft see off balance sheet arrangements above 
the pre tax impact on earnings if we are required to capitalize both leases on our financial statements would be the amount of the annual depreciation  which we estimate to be approximately million to million 
the impact of capitalizing these leases on the balance sheet would be increases in the amount of property  plant and equipment and long term debt  which would also increase our long term debt to total invested capital ratio
