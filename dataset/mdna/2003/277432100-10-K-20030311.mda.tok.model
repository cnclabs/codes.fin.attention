item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements for eastman chemical company eastman or the company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
all references to earnings per share contained in this report are diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the company s management must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and assumptions on which to base estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  impaired assets  restructuring of operations  environmental costs  pensions and other postemployment benefits  goodwill and intangible assets  and litigation and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s management believes the critical accounting policies described below are the most important to the fair presentation of the company s financial condition and results 
the policies require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
customer programs and incentives the company records estimated obligations for customer programs and incentive offerings  which consist primarily of revenue or volume based amounts that a customer must achieve over a specified period of time  as a reduction of revenue to each underlying revenue transaction as the customer progresses toward reaching goals specified in incentive agreements 
these estimates are based on a combination of forecast of customer sales and actual sales volumes and revenues against established goals  the customer s current level of purchases  and eastman s knowledge of customer purchasing habits and industry pricing practice 
the incentive payment rate may be variable  based upon the customer reaching higher sales volume or revenue levels over a specified period of time in order to receive an agreed upon incentive payment 
the company s reserve for customer programs and incentives was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively  and was recorded as a reduction of trade receivables 
if market conditions change  the company may take actions to adjust customer incentive offerings to maintain market share and capacity utilization 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
management continuously assesses the financial condition of the company s customers and the markets in which these customers participate and adjusts credit limits or the allowance for doubtful accounts based on this periodic review 
actual losses for uncollectible accounts have historically been consistent with the company s estimates 
however  deteriorating financial conditions of certain key customers or a significant continued slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on the company s ability to collect on accounts  in which case additional allowances may be required 
the company s allowance for doubtful accounts was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
further information is provided in schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts 
in response to economic developments in argentina in late  management established a reserve for credit risks related to devaluation of the peso 
at december   the reserve was established at million and at december   million remained in the reserve 
management believes the reserve balance at december  adequately reflects the company s potential losses 

table of contents eastman chemical company and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations inventory reserves inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the company determines the cost of most raw materials  work in process  and finished goods inventories in the united states of america by the last in  first out lifo method 
at december    and the company had million  million  and million  respectively  recorded in the lifo reserve 
the cost of all other inventories  including inventories outside the united states of america  is determined by the average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out method 
the company regularly compares inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future requirements to identify and evaluate inventory items for obsolescence and excessive quantities 
several factors  such as decisions to exit product lines  technological changes  changes in customer requirements  and new product development  could result in a change in the amount of obsolete or excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case excess and obsolete inventory provisions may be understated or overstated 
the company writes down its inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company s reserve for excess and obsolete inventories was million at december   and million at december  and impaired assets the company evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to be held and used  including definite lived intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the total projected undiscounted cash flows from such asset are separately identifiable and are less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on long lived assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
as the company s assumptions related to assets to be held and used are subject to change  additional write downs may be required in the future 
if estimates of fair value less costs to sell are revised  the carrying amount of the related asset is adjusted  resulting in recognition of a charge or benefit to earnings 
restructuring of operations the company records restructuring charges incurred in connection with consolidation or relocation of operations  exited business lines  or shutdowns of specific sites 
these restructuring charges  which reflect management s commitment to a termination or exit plan that generally will begin and will be substantially completed within months  are based on estimates of the expected costs associated with site closure  legal and environmental matters  demolition  contract terminations  or other costs directly related to the restructuring 
if the actual cost incurred exceeds the estimated cost  an additional charge to earnings will result 
if the actual cost is less than the estimated cost  a credit to earnings will be recognized 
at december    and  the company s reserve for restructuring of operations  including severance and site closure costs  was million  million  and million  respectively 
for additional information see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental costs the company accrues environmental costs when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
when a single amount cannot be reasonably estimated but the cost can be estimated within a range  the company accrues the minimum amount 
the amount accrued reflects the company s assumptions about remediation requirements at the contaminated site  the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based  unanticipated government enforcement action  or changes in health  safety  environmental  and chemical control regulations and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs 
estimated future environmental contingencies ranged from the minimum or best estimate of million to the maximum of million at december  the company s reserve for environmental contingencies was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively  representing the minimum or best estimate for remediation costs and  for closure postclosure  costs accrued to date over the facilities estimated useful lives 
for additional information see note to the company s consolidated financial statements and schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts 

table of contents eastman chemical company and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pension and other postemployment benefits the company maintains defined benefit plans that provide eligible employees with retirement benefits 
additionally  eastman provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions related to general economic conditions particularly interest rates  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase for employees and health care cost trends 
at december   the company assumed a discount rate of  an expected return on assets of  a rate of compensation increase of  and an initial health care cost trend of 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
for example  a increase in health care cost trend would increase the service and interest costs by million  and the benefit obligation by million 
a decrease in health care cost trend would decrease the service and interest costs by million  and the benefit obligation by million 
for additional information see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangibles prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company amortized certain intangible assets on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 effective january  under the provisions of sfas no 
 the company performs the annual review for impairment at the reporting unit level  which eastman has determined to be one level below its operating segment level and considers the criteria set forth in sfas no 
in aggregating the reporting units 
the tests are performed by determining the fair values of the reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and comparing those fair values to the carrying values of the reporting units  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the company then allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the reporting unit s fair value was the price to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess 
events or changes in circumstances could occur that may create underperformance relative to projected future cash flows which could create future impairments 
at december    and  the company recorded approximately million  million  and million  respectively  of goodwill and million  million  and million  respectively  of other intangibles 
litigation and contingent liabilities from time to time  the company and its operations are parties to or targets of lawsuits  claims  investigations and proceedings  including product liability  personal injury  patent and intellectual property  commercial  contract  environmental  antitrust  health and safety  and employment matters  which are handled and defended in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues a liability for such matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the company believes the amounts reserved are adequate for such pending matters  however  results of operations could be affected by significant litigation adverse to the company 

table of contents eastman chemical company and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations nonrecurring items it is the company s policy to report as a nonrecurring item a material charge or gain that is not associated with on going operations or that is caused by unique events not reflective of the company s normal business activities in the period if such items individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on a specific line item in the consolidated statements of earnings loss or have a material impact on results overall 
the company believes that separately reporting such charges or gains enhances transparency and comparability of results by removing distortion that would otherwise occur 
examples of such items that have been separately reported in the past under this policy include material charges or gains resulting from asset impairments and restructuring of operations  including employee terminations  litigation not related to on going operations  discontinued businesses  and acquisition charges including those related to acquired in process research and development 
nonrecurring items are appropriately identified in the consolidated statements of earnings loss

operational disruptions at the company s plants in rotterdam  the netherlands and columbia  south carolina negatively impacted gross profit by approximately million 
fourth quarter asset charges relating primarily to equipment dismantlements and other write offs totaling approximately million also had a negative impact on gross profit 
the following factors affect the company s ability to impact margins by increasing selling prices the worldwide supply demand balance of products and services sold by the company  the relative cost positions of the company s competitors  the power of the company s customers to resist rising selling prices  and whether or not the company s products and services are different or unique compared to products offered by its competitors 
the company expects that higher raw material costs and a sluggish global economy in will negatively impact operating results unless the company is able to offset this impact in part through price increases for certain of its products and through various cost control measures 
in addition  the company has begun taking the following actions to improve its near term and long term profitability immediate corporate actions to reduce costs in the areas of labor  travel  contractors  fees and out of pocket purchases of all kinds  implementation of organizational changes to improve efficiency and better enable strategy execution  and review of the company s portfolio of products and businesses  primarily in the eastman division  the company expects that some of its product lines or businesses may be removed from its portfolio to improve profitability

table of contents eastman chemical company and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary by operating segment the company s products and operations are managed and reported in five operating segments 
effective january   the company implemented a divisional structure that separated the businesses into two divisions 
eastman division consists of the caspi segment  the pci segment and the sp segment 
voridian division contains the polymers segment and the fibers segment 
the divisional structure has allowed the company to align costs more directly with the activities and businesses that generate them 
the divisional and segment results for  but not for prior periods  reflect this new cost structure 
with the implementation of the divisional structure  goods and services are transferred between the two divisions at predetermined prices that may be in excess of cost 
accordingly  the divisional structure results in the recognition of interdivisional sales revenue and operating earnings 
such interdivisional transactions are eliminated in the company s consolidated financial statements 
prior to  segment sales revenue reflected only actual sales to third parties and the intersegment transfer of goods and services  recorded at cost  had no impact on segment earnings 
all eastman chemical company assets were allocated to the divisions as of january  corporate  general purpose and other nonoperating assets were allocated to segments within each division based on process or product responsibility 
certain infrastructure assets at each site  primarily utilities that were previously allocated to all five segments  were allocated to the primary division at that site 
the primary division invoices the other division for services provided by such infrastructure assets 
effective january   sales and operating results for cendian  the company s logistics subsidiary and an eastman division initiative  are included in amounts for the caspi  pci and sp segments  and have been allocated to these segments on the basis of sales revenues for each of these segments 
prior to  sales and operating results for cendian were allocated to all five segments 
effective january   certain compounded polyethylene products were moved from the polymers segment to the sp segment 
accordingly  amounts for and have been reclassified to reflect this change 
operating earnings for for the caspi segment and the sp segment have been reclassified from those presented in the company s january  sales and earnings press release 
the caspi segment manufactures raw materials  additives and specialty polymers  primarily for the paints and coatings  inks and graphic arts  adhesives and other markets 
the caspi segment s products consist of binders and resins  liquid vehicles  pigment concentrates and additives  unsaturated polyester resins and polyester and acrylic emulsions

in addition to the factors described in this report  the following are some of the important factors that could cause the company s actual results to differ materially from those in any such forward looking statements the company has manufacturing and marketing operations throughout the world  with approximately of the company s revenues attributable to sales outside the united states 
economic factors  including foreign currency exchange rates  could affect the company s revenues  expenses and results 
although the company utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate market fluctuations in foreign currencies  any changes in strategy in regard to risk management tools can also affect revenues  expenses and results and there can be no assurance that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  changes in laws  regulations  or other political factors in any of the countries in which the company operates could affect business in that country or region  as well as the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company has made and may continue to make acquisitions  divestitures and investments  and enter into alliances  as part of its growth strategy 
the completion of such transactions are subject to the timely receipt of necessary regulatory and other consents and approvals needed to complete the transactions which could be delayed for a variety of reasons  including the satisfactory negotiation of the transaction documents and the fulfillment of all closing conditions to the transactions 
additionally  after completion of the transactions  there can be no assurance that such transactions will be successfully integrated on a timely and cost efficient basis or that they will achieve projected operating earnings targets 
the company has made strategic technology investments  including formation of joint ventures and investments in other technology businesses  in order to build certain eastman capabilities 
there can be no assurance that such investments will achieve their objectives or that they will be beneficial to the company s results of operations 
the company owns assets in the form of equity in other companies  including joint ventures  technology investments and genencor 
such investments are minority investments in companies which are not managed or controlled by the company and are subject to all of the risks associated with changes in value of such investments including the market valuation of those companies whose shares are publicly traded 

table of contents eastman chemical company and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company has undertaken and will continue to undertake productivity and cost reduction initiatives and organizational restructurings to improve performance and generate cost savings 
there can be no assurance that these will be completed as planned or beneficial or that estimated cost savings from such activities will be realized 
in addition to cost reduction initiatives  the company is striving to improve margins on its products through price increases  where warranted and accepted by the market  however  the company s earnings could be negatively impacted should such increases be unrealized  not be sufficient to cover increased raw material costs  or have a negative impact on demand and volume 
the company is reliant on certain strategic raw materials for its operations and utilizes risk management tools  including hedging  as appropriate  to mitigate short term market fluctuations in raw material costs 
there can be no assurance  however  that such measures will result in cost savings or that all market fluctuation exposure will be eliminated 
in addition  changes in laws or regulations  war or other outbreak of hostilities  or other political factors in any of the countries or regions in which the company operates or does business  or in countries or regions that are key suppliers of strategic raw materials  could affect availability and costs of raw materials 
while temporary shortages of raw materials and energy may occasionally occur  these items are generally sufficiently available to cover current and projected requirements 
however  their continuous availability and price are subject to unscheduled plant interruptions occurring during periods of high demand  or due to domestic or world market and political conditions  changes in government regulation  war or other outbreak of hostilities 
eastman s operations or products may  at times  be adversely affected by these factors 
the company s competitive position in the markets in which it participates is  in part  subject to external factors 
for example  supply and demand for certain of the company s products is driven by end use markets and worldwide capacities which  in turn  impact demand for and pricing of the company s products 
the company has an extensive customer base  however  loss of certain top customers could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations until such business is replaced 
limitation of the company s available manufacturing capacity due to significant disruption in its manufacturing operations could have a material adverse affect on revenues  expenses and results of operations and financial condition 
the company s facilities and businesses are subject to complex health  safety and environmental laws and regulations  which require and will continue to require significant expenditures to remain in compliance with such laws and regulations currently and in the future 
the company s accruals for such costs and associated liabilities are believed to be adequate  but are subject to changes in estimates on which the accruals are based 
the estimates depend on a number of factors including those associated with on going operations and remedial requirements 
on going operations can be affected by unanticipated government enforcement action  which in turn is influenced by the nature of the allegation and the complexity of the site 
likewise  changes in chemical control regulations and testing requirements can increase costs or result in product deselection 
remediation requirements at contaminated sites are dependent on the nature of the remedy  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi party sites  and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties 
the company accesses the capital and credit markets on a regular basis 
access to these markets and the cost of capital and debt financing is dependent upon the company s credit rating received from independent credit rating agencies 
a downgrade of one level in the company s credit rating is not anticipated  but should it occur  would not cause a significant impact on the commitments or sources of capital or debt available to the company  and would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
however  an adverse change in the company s credit rating could affect the renewal of existing credit facilities or the company s ability to obtain access to new credit facilities in the future  could adversely affect the terms under which the company can borrow  and could increase the cost of borrowings under such facilities

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of its business due to its use of certain financial instruments as well as transacting in various foreign currencies and funding of foreign operations 
to mitigate the company s exposure to these market risks  eastman has established policies  procedures  and internal processes governing its management of financial market risks and the use of financial instruments to manage its exposure to such risks 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its borrowing activities  which include short term commercial paper and long term borrowings used to maintain liquidity and to fund its business operations and capital requirements 
currently  these borrowings are predominately us dollar denominated 
the nature and amount of the company s long term and short term debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions  and other factors 
the company s operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company continually evaluates its foreign currency exposure based on current market conditions and the locations in which the company conducts business 
in order to mitigate the effect of foreign currency risk  the company enters into forward exchange contracts to hedge certain firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies and currency options to hedge probable anticipated but not yet committed export sales and purchase transactions expected within no more than two years and denominated in foreign currencies 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of related exposures 
it is the company s policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above 
the company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative purposes 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in market prices for certain of its major raw materials 
to mitigate short term fluctuations in market prices for certain commodities  principally propane  ethane  and natural gas  the company enters into forwards and options contracts 
the company determines its market risk utilizing sensitivity analysis  which measures the potential losses in fair value resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and or commodity prices 
for and  the market risk associated with the fair value of interest rate sensitive instruments  assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in interest rates of are approximately million and million  respectively  and an additional million for each one percentage point change in interest rates thereafter 
this exposure is primarily related to long term debt with fixed interest rates 
the market risk associated with foreign currency sensitive instruments utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model and a adverse move in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency hedged by the company is approximately million and million and an additional million and million for and  respectively  for an additional one percentage point adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
further adverse movements in foreign currencies would create losses in fair value  however  such losses would not be linear to that disclosed above 
this exposure  which is primarily related to foreign currency options purchased by the company to manage fluctuations in foreign currencies  is limited to the dollar value of option premiums payable by the company for the related financial instruments 
in  the market risk associated with foreign currency options utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model and a adverse change in the us dollar relative to each foreign currency results in a million loss in fair value 
furthermore  since the company utilizes currency sensitive derivative instruments for hedging anticipated foreign currency transactions  a loss in fair value for those instruments is generally offset by increases in the value of the underlying anticipated transactions 
the market risk associated with feedstock options and natural gas swaps assuming an instantaneous parallel shift in the underlying commodity price of is approximately million and an additional million and million for and  respectively  for each one percentage point move in closing prices thereafter
