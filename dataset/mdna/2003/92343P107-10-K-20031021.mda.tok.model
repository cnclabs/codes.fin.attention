item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors 
part i item business general we are a leading provider of integrated geophysical services to the petroleum industry worldwide 
our customers include major  national and independent oil and gas companies that utilize geophysical technologies to identify new areas where subsurface conditions are favorable for the production of hydrocarbons 
determine the size and structure of previously identified oil and gas fields 
optimize development and production of hydrocarbon reserves 
we acquire  process  and interpret geophysical data and produce geophysical surveys that are either d or d images of the subsurface geology in the survey area 
we also produce d surveys  which record fluid movement in the reservoir  by repeating specific d surveys over time 
additionally  we use geophysical data for reservoir characterization to enable our customers to maximize their recovery of oil and natural gas 
services and markets we conduct geophysical surveys on both a contract and a multi client basis 
when we conduct surveys on a contract basis  we acquire and process data for a single client who pays us to conduct the survey and owns the data we acquire 
when we conduct surveys on a multi client basis  we acquire and process data for our own account and license that data and associated products to multiple clients 
approximately of our fiscal revenue was generated through the licensing of multi client data 
the high cost of acquiring and processing geophysical data on an exclusive basis has prompted many oil and gas companies to license surveys on a multi client basis 
in response to this demand  we have built a large library of surveys consisting of  line kilometers of d survey data and  square kilometers of d data 
our marine library includes surveys in the gulf of mexico  the north atlantic  southeast asia  west africa  north africa  canada and brazil 
our land data library includes surveys in texas  mississippi  oklahoma  wyoming and alberta  canada 
the following tables describe our revenues by contract type and geographic area years ended july  revenues by contract type in thousands contract work    licensing of multi client data    total    years ended july  revenues by geographic area in thousands united states    canada    latin america    europe    middle east africa    asia pacific    total    in fiscal  and   and  respectively  of our revenues were attributable to non us operations and export sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional geographic and segment information principal operating assets we acquire  process  and interpret geophysical information utilizing a wide array of assets as follows land acquisition our land acquisition activities are performed with technologically advanced geophysical equipment 
as of july   the equipment had a combined recording capacity of  channels 
this equipment is deployed in north and south america and oman by crews of varying size 
crew count varies widely as land acquisition is a seasonal activity in many markets  primarily due to weather 
each crew consists of a surveying unit that lays out the lines to be recorded and marks the site for shot hole placement or equipment location  an explosive or mechanical vibrating unit that produces the acoustical impulse and a recording unit that synchronizes the shooting and captures the signal via geophones 
on a land survey where explosives are used  the geophysical crew is supported by several drill crews  which are typically furnished by third parties under short term contracts 
drill crews operate in advance of the geophysical crew and bore shallow holes for explosive charges which  when detonated by the geophysical crew  produce the necessary acoustical impulse 
marine acquisition our marine acquisition crews operate from both owned and chartered vessels that have been modified or equipped to our specifications 
all of the vessels we utilize are equipped to perform both d and d geophysical surveys 
during the last several years  the majority of the marine geophysical data acquisition services we performed involved d surveys 
the following table contains certain information concerning the geophysical vessels we operate 
year entered vessel service length beam charter expiration pacific sword feet feet october seisquest feet feet may veritas viking feet feet may veritas viking ii 
feet feet may veritas vantage feet feet april veritas searcher feet feet owned each vessel has an equipment complement consisting of geophysical recording instrumentation  digital geophysical streamer cable  cable location and geophysical data location systems  multiple navigation systems  a source control system that controls the synchronization of the energy source and a firing system that generates the acoustical impulses 
streamer cables contain hydrophones that receive the acoustical impulses reflected by variations in the subsurface strata 
at present  five of our vessels are equipped with multiple streamers and multiple energy sources 
these vessels acquire more lines of data with each pass  which reduces completion time and the acquisition cost 
the veritas vikings and the veritas vantage are each capable of deploying streamers simultaneously  although each is currently equipped to tow eight 
the veritas viking  veritas vantage and veritas searcher are equipped with solid streamers that offer numerous advantages over oil filled streamers 
the solid streamers allow these vessels to work in rougher seas and record more desirable frequencies with less noise and less downtime than is possible with oil filled streamers 
the viking ii is expected to be equipped with solid streamers during fiscal we plan to upgrade the remainder of the fleet with solid streamers as replacement is required through normal attrition 
data processing and interpretation we operate data processing centers capable of processing d and d data 
most of our data processing services are performed on d seismic data 
the centers process data received from the field  both from our own and other geophysical crews  to produce an image of the earth s subsurface using proprietary computer software and techniques 
we also reprocess older geophysical data using new techniques designed to enhance the quality of the data 
our data processing centers have opened at various times since and are at present located in europe africa north america south america middle east asia pacific houston  texas buenos aires  argentina crawley  england singapore calgary  canada caracas  venezuela stavanger  norway perth  australia aberdeen  scotland jakarta  indonesia lagos  nigeria kuala lumpur  malaysia our processing centers operate high capacity  advanced technology data processing systems on high speed networks 
these systems run our proprietary data processing software 
the marine and land data acquisition crews have software compatible with that utilized in the processing centers  allowing for ease in the movement of data from the field to the data processing centers 
our centers can generally process both land and marine data and we tailor the equipment and software deployed in an area to meet the local market demands 
we operate four visualization centers in houston  calgary  perth  and crawley 
these centers allow teams of geoscientists and engineers to view and interpret large volumes of complex d data 
the visualization centers have imaging tools used for advanced interpretive techniques that enhance the understanding of regional geology and reservoir modeling 
these visualization centers allow us to offer the type of collaborative geophysical model building that is enabling oil companies to explore areas of complex geology such as the large sub salt plays in the deepwater gulf of mexico 
we have groups of scientists and engineers located in calgary  houston  and leoben  austria who perform advanced geophysical interpretation on a contract basis 
these geophysical experts work around the world  using third party and our proprietary software to create subsurface models for our clients and advising our clients on how best to exploit their reservoirs 
their work is related to exploration as well as production activities 
additionally  we license the proprietary software obtained through our acquisition of hampson russell to companies desiring to do their own geophysical interpretation 
technology and capital expenditures the geophysical industry is highly technical  and the requirements for the acquisition and processing of geophysical data have evolved continuously during the past years 
accordingly  it is critical that our technological capabilities are comparable or superior to those of our competitors 
we maintain our technological capabilities through continuing research and development  strategic alliances with equipment manufacturers  and by acquiring technology under license from others 
currently  we employ approximately people in our research and development activities  substantially all of who are scientists  engineers or programmers 
during fiscal  and  research and development expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
our research and development budget for fiscal is million 
during fiscal  and  capital expenditures for equipment were million  million and million  respectively 
the higher capital spending in and was due primarily to the outfitting of new seismic vessels 
our capital expenditure budget for equipment in fiscal is approximately million 
the actual level of future capital expenditures for equipment will depend on the availability of funding and market requirements as dictated by oil and gas company spending levels 
a substantial portion of our fiscal capital budget is allocated to replacement and upgrading of existing equipment  particularly land acquisition equipment 
only million of the budget is allocated to capacity expansion  contingent upon execution of a new land acquisition contract in oman 
during fiscal  and  cash multi client investment was million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  we are planning to reduce our cash multi client investment to approximately million 
we intend to manage our capital spending and investment in multi client library data in order to generate positive free cash flow in fiscal competition the acquisition and processing of geophysical data for the oil and gas industry has historically been highly competitive worldwide 
success in marketing geophysical services is based on several factors  including price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise  reputation for quality and dependability and  in the case of multi client surveys  availability of surveys in the area of current customer interest 
our largest global competitors are western geco a joint venture between schlumberger and baker hughes  compagnie generale de geophysique and petroleum geo services asa 
additionally  there are a large number of seismic companies  mostly small and local  in the land acquisition and land processing areas where financial and technical barriers to entry are minimal 
in the multi client library business  we compete with the full service seismic companies mentioned above  as well as with specialty library companies such as tgs nopec geophysical company asa and seitel inc we compete to a lesser degree with large  state controlled companies such as bgp of china primarily land acquisition and smng of russia primarily marine acquisition 
these companies are large providers of seismic services in their home countries and have recently been expanding their operations to include other parts of the world 
they are particularly aggressive in price sensitive markets  such as those involving large tenders to national oil companies  where low price is of paramount importance 
due to the constantly changing configurations of seismic crews and the immense numbers of channels in the market  it is impossible to discuss the global competition in land acquisition in any quantitative fashion 
tracking is easier in the marine acquisition market  where our six vessels routinely compete against to other vessels 
as of july   our competitive analysis showed a total of vessels working in our markets  of which were d capable and which were used only on d surveys 
vessel capacity exceeds current demand  often resulting in aggressive price competition in this business 
we have been able to obtain relatively full utilization of our fleet  with very little downtime between projects  with a combination of contract and multi client work 
backlog at july   our backlog of commitments for future revenue was million  compared with million at july  approximately of this backlog is related to multi client surveys 
we anticipate that the vast majority of the july  backlog will be completed in the next months 
this backlog consists of written orders or firm commitments 
contracts for services are subject to modification by mutual consent and in certain instances are cancelable by the customer on short notice without penalty 
as a result of these factors  our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of our actual operating results for any succeeding period 
significant customers historically  our principal customers have been major oil and gas companies  national oil companies and independent oil and gas companies 
in fiscal and  no customer accounted for or more of total revenues 
in fiscal  petroleo brasileiro sa accounted for of our revenue due to their funding of several multi client surveys in brazil 
employees during fiscal  we employed an average of  people on a full time basis 
our number of employees varies greatly due to changing activity in our land acquisition business and ranged this year from a low of  to a high of  a total of employees in bolivia  in argentina  in peru and in singapore are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good

these leases expire at various times through fiscal we also own and charter seismic acquisition vessels as listed under item business principal operating assets marine acquisition of this report 
item legal proceedings on september   we filed suit in federal court against one of our customers seeking million in damages for its failure to pay past due invoices and for other damages 
the customer has  in turn  filed a counterclaim against us alleging that the services were not properly performed  although the counterclaim did not specify the amount of damages claimed 
we believe the facts in the matter are in our favor  however  during our third quarter we reserved million of the related receivable in response to a going concern qualification to the audit opinion in the customer s form k filing 
as of its most recent q  the customer is continuing to have borrowing base issues with its lenders 
we will continue to monitor the financial condition of the customer and  if necessary  adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect current circumstances 
the matter has currently been ordered to mediation by the judge 
our remaining balance sheet exposure to this claim is million at july  on occasion  we are named as a defendant in litigation relating to our normal business operations 
although we are insured against various business risks to the extent we believe prudent  there is no assurance that the nature and amount of such insurance will be adequate in every case

fiscal included charges of million for impairment of multi client surveys  million for costs of a terminated merger  and million valuation allowance for argentine deferred tax assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted the use of these new accounting statements in august sfas no 
defines the booking and subsequent treatment of goodwill and other intangible assets derived from business combinations and supercedes apb opinion no 
this statement required us to discontinue our amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization is not included in the net losses for fiscal and in fiscal  due to market conditions  we determined that all of our goodwill was impaired and  as a result  incurred a million charge  which was included in our operating loss for the year 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal was a transitional year for veritas 
since the veritas digicon merger in  we have been focused on growing the company using prudent amounts of cash from outside sources  including equity sales and debt 
at the beginning of fiscal  we decided to grow only as fast as our internal cash generation would allow and we set a goal to be free cash flow positive for the year 
in order to achieve that goal we sought contract work more aggressively and reduced our capital spending to a level well below that of prior years 
we also reduced our investment in multi client library 
these actions enabled us to generate million of free cash flow in a difficult market environment 
the million of free cash flow is the difference between the million of cash we generated from operating activities and the million we reinvested in our multi client library and capital equipment 
we believe this achievement represents a turning point for our company and we expect to continue to generate positive free cash flow in the coming year 
the past year was also a transitional year for many other companies in the seismic industry 
two of our competitors  petroleum geo services and seitel inc have filed for bankruptcy protection and several others are re evaluating their business strategies 
few  if any  companies in the industry are operating in a business as usual manner 
while this has been a difficult year for the seismic industry  our customer base  overall  has been financially healthy due to continued high commodity prices 
however  many of our customers have been using a substantial portion of their discretionary cash to pay down debt  buy back their stock  drill low risk prospects and maximize production from existing fields rather than exploring for new prospects 
we do not see any indications that this spending pattern will change much in the next to months 
fiscal looks like it will again be a difficult year as we foresee the operating environment will be similar to that of fiscal our plans include maintaining our focus on cash flow and  therefore  doing more contract work and investing less in our multi client library 
with other full service geophysical contractors adopting a similar strategy  this may increase pricing pressure in the contract business 
on a longer term basis  we believe that our customers will need to explore more aggressively to maintain their petroleum reserves 
there are many areas where an upturn in exploration is possible  most significantly the deepwater gulf of mexico and offshore brazil 
licenses to many of the deepwater blocks in the gulf of mexico  originally licensed in the mid to late s will be expiring over the years  stimulating interest from new players in that market 
we have extensive multi client surveys in this region and could profit from the turnover of licenses 
similarly  petrobras has made large discoveries in offshore brazil  where we have invested heavily in multi client surveys and blocks are licensed in a manner resulting in turnover every three years 
our data will provide timely information to potential new entrants in that growing market 
in the current environment  meanwhile  we will continue to improve and expand our technical capabilities while maintaining our financial flexibility 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal multi client revenues decreased primarily due to lower sales of completed surveys in the gulf of mexico and canada offshore partially offset by increased revenue from the canadian foothills  nigeria and brazil 
contract revenues increased due to projects in the gulf of mexico  trinidad  asia pacific and us onshore 
contract revenue represented of the total revenue in fiscal  compared to in  and management expects it to comprise the majority of our revenue in the upcoming years 
operating income loss 
the operating loss increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the current year includes an impairment charge for goodwill of million  an impairment of multi client surveys of million and a reserve for the sale of rc of million 
the prior year included a million impairment of multi client surveys and a million charge for merger costs 
operating income  excluding the charges of for the current year and million for the prior year  decreased by 
although contract margins increased due to higher pricing and favorable geographic mix  overall margins declined due to lower margins from multi client revenue caused by lower sales of fully amortized  margin  surveys 
operating income in fiscal was further reduced by million of forced amortization of slow moving surveys  as compared to million in fiscal forced amortization is the amortization required to reduce the book value of a survey to the value that would have been recorded had the survey been subject to straight line amortization over the last months of book life  rather than amortization resulting from application of the sales forecast method 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of multi client accounting forced amortization does not indicate that a survey is impaired  only that sales to date have been insufficient to maintain a minimum cumulative amortization 
as of the first quarter of fiscal  we will change our multi client amortization policy to include minimum amortization of surveys from their date of completion instead of only in the last months of survey book life 
however  the sales forecast method will continue to be the primary method of recording cost of services 
this change will result in a catch up adjustment of million that will be recognized as additional amortization expense during the first quarter of fiscal additionally  we expect the new policy to result in at least million of forced amortization  up from the million recognized in fiscal we periodically review the carrying value of the multi client data library to assess whether there has been a permanent impairment of value and record losses when it is determined that estimated sales would not be sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset 
in fiscal  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge related to a survey in the gulf of mexico that we have been unable to license 
this survey was acquired at right angles to an existing survey  and while a technical success  customers have not been willing to pay for the increased resolution 
in fiscal  we recognized a million pretax impairment charge related to of our multi client library surveys 
seven of these were land surveys located in the gulf coast region 
exploration spending has been very low in this region since we completed these surveys  and we do not anticipate any sales of these surveys in the foreseeable future 
therefore  these surveys were written off  with a net charge of million 
we have one survey in the gulf of mexico that was shot at a cost significantly exceeding its original budget 
as we did not forecast enough sales to amortize the remainder of the cost of the survey  we wrote it down by million 
this left million of cost for this survey  an amount we believed to be the fair value of the survey based on future estimated sales 
in the shetland faroes area of the north sea  we have a large survey that has been troubled by an ongoing territorial dispute 
when the dispute was settled  nine year concessions were awarded to various licensees 
given the length of the license period  we did not foresee significant near term additional licensing of this survey  and we wrote it off with a net charge of million 
we also have two small d surveys off africa that were written off with a net charge of million 
operating income in fiscal was reduced by million as a result of a charge to establish a reserve against our account receivable from one of our customers 
we have filed suit against the customer for full recovery of our receivable  as described in item  legal proceedings  on page of this report 
our remaining balance sheet exposure to this claim is million  as of july operating income in fiscal was reduced by million due to costs associated with our terminated merger with pgs 
we have not been satisfied with the results of the software operation acquired with the rc business in february we were not making the software sales projected in our acquisition plan and were ineffective at bringing any new products to market 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to sell this operation and entered into a letter of intent with seismic micro technology  inc  a company more focused on software development 
we have also taken a charge in the fourth quarter of million related to these operations 
million of this charge was applied to reduce the carrying value of the rc software to its estimated market value of million 
the remaining million primarily relates to employee severance and facility costs 
the sales agreement allows us to continue using the rc suite of software in our reservoir consulting business 
the sale closed in september  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our reduced earnings  coupled with the instability in the industry  have led to a sharp decline in our stock price  leaving our market value below our book value 
as a result of our continued weak stock price and the sale of the rc software business  we performed an evaluation of our existing goodwill balance at the end of fiscal this analysis indicated our goodwill was impaired and  as a result  we recognized an impairment charge of million  an amount equal to our entire goodwill balance 
general and administrative expense increased by million from the prior year primarily due to severance costs related to our overhead reduction efforts 
interest expense increased by  or million  due to the increased average balance of outstanding long term debt and the expensing of the remainder of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with our senior notes  which were retired in the third quarter of fiscal other expense income  net 
other expense income  net decreased from an expense of million in fiscal to an expense of million in fiscal foreign exchange losses in argentina and canada contributed million of net expense to the prior year 
additionally  a loss on investment contributed million of additional expense in the prior year 
this was partially offset by a decrease in interest income from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of lower cash balances in the first half of the fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  our unconsolidated joint venture in indonesia incurred a loss of million in fiscal compared to income of million in fiscal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by million from fiscal to fiscal due to unbenefitted net operating losses in the current year  non deductibility of our goodwill impairment and increased valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on deferred taxes fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues decreased  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal multi client revenues increased due to highly pre funded projects in brazil and the north sea  offset by declines in licenses of us land surveys 
contract revenues decreased due to continued overcapacity and aggressive industry pricing which kept our marine fleet focused on multi client projects 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased by million  to a loss of million  due to the impairment of multi client surveys and merger costs 
operating income  excluding the charges of million previously described  increased by 
the largest contributor to the increase was improved contract margins and a favorable revenue mix towards multi client  rather than contract  work 
this is reflected in the reduction in cost of services as a percentage of revenues from in fiscal to this year 
we also benefited by million from the elimination of goodwill amortization in fiscal due to a change in accounting rules  and by million of reduced general and administrative costs related to reduced information technology expenses and lower employee bonuses 
in fiscal  we recorded an expense of million related to the doubtful collection of our miller exploration company long term receivable 
in fiscal  we had released the million reserve related to this receivable based on miller exploration company s public reporting of their intent and ability to pay amounts owed to us 
partially offsetting these decreases was an additional million  a increase  in research and development expense in fiscal other expense income  net 
other expense income  net was reduced from million of income in fiscal to an expense of million in fiscal interest income of million in the prior year was reduced to million in fiscal due to lower cash balances 
foreign exchange losses in argentina and canada added million of net expense 
additionally  a loss on investment in miller exploration company s stock and warrants in contributed million of additional expense 
in the fourth quarter of  we initiated a program to liquidate our investment in miller exploration company and recognized the unrealized loss as expense  as we felt that the reduction in value was other than temporary 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased by million from fiscal to fiscal due to the tax loss incurred in the tax benefit related to the million charge was million 
additionally  we recorded a million tax valuation allowance related to net operating losses in argentina  the value of which are not likely to be realized due to our suspension of activity there 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses our internal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and cash flow from operations 
external sources include public financing  equity sales  equipment financing  our revolving loan facility and trade credit 
we believe that our current cash balance and cash flow from operations are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for fiscal for the past three years  cash provided by our operating activities has been relatively constant  varying between million and million 
however  combined expenditures for capital equipment and multi client surveys have consistently dropped over the three periods  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and finally to million in fiscal we expect spending to increase modestly in fiscal  but also expect that cash provided by operating activities will again exceed our investment in our operations 
for fiscal  we have budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million approximately million committed and cash multi client library investment of approximately million  for a combined million investment 
these amounts are relatively flexible and will be adjusted to meet the needs of the business 
in addition to these amounts we plan to spend approximately million for research and development  approximately equal to the million we spent in fiscal free cash flow from operations has become an important measure of liquidity for us 
we define free cash flow as cash from operating activities less cash multi client spending and capital expenditures 
this non gaap liquidity measure is useful as an addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of cash provided by operating activities because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets and therefore presents a more complete picture of net cash flow from ongoing operations 
this measure excludes items such as proceeds from the disposal of assets  cash paid for acquisitions and all financing activities 
a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by operating activities is presented in the following table years ended july  in thousands free cash flow    add back multi client expenditures  net cash    capital expenditures    total cash provided by operating activities    on february   we entered into a credit agreement the credit agreement with deutsche bank ag  new york branch  as administrative agent  deutsche bank ag  canada branch  as canadian administrative agent  and certain other lending institutions 
the credit agreement provides term financing of million under term a  term b and term c tranches the term loans  a revolving loan facility aggregating million  including a facility for swing line loans of up to million and the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to million 
proceeds from the term loans were used to satisfy the obligations under our previous credit agreement and our senior notes 
the term a loan was in the original principal amount of million and matures in february  and requires quarterly interest payments at a rate  at our election  of libor plus a margin ranging from to or a base rate plus a margin ranging from to 
these margins are based on certain of our financial ratios 
the term b loan was in the original principal amount of million  matures in february  and requires quarterly interest payments at a rate  at our election  of libor plus  subject to a libor floor or a base rate plus 
the term c loan was in the original principal amount of million  matures in february  and requires quarterly interest payments at a rate  at our election  of libor plus  subject to a libor floor or a base rate plus 
the term a and term b loans require quarterly combined principal payments of  representing of the initial principal balances 
should there be an event of default or an unmatured event of default exists  or the credit rating of any of the debt falls below moody s ba or s p s bb  or our leverage ratio as of the last day of the most recent excess cash flow calculation period rises above certain levels  the term a and b loans also require principal payments of of the prior fiscal year s cash flow  calculated as per the loan agreement 
this payment is due days after the end of the fiscal year 
as our lowest debt ratings are ba by moody s and bb by s p  veritas will pay million of principal in november related to the company s cash flow from january  through july  future payments of this type  if any  will be based on cash flow for full fiscal years 
loans made under the revolving loan facilities  including swing line loans  bear interest at a variable rate determined on the date of borrowing that is related to various base rates and margins depending upon our leverage ratio and the location of the borrowing 
the revolver expires in february the financing is secured by assets  including equipment  vehicles  multi client data library  intellectual property  and stock of certain material subsidiaries  owned by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
at july   the carrying value of the secured assets  including intercompany receivables  was billion 
the credit agreement and related documents contain a number of covenants  including financial covenants relating to interest coverage  leverage and net worth 
on february   the term loans totaling million were funded and letters of credit in the amount of approximately million then outstanding from the previous credit agreement were transferred to the credit agreement 
proceeds from the term loans were used to satisfy the obligations under the previous credit agreement and the senior notes 
we incurred million of debt issuance costs related to the new credit agreement 
these costs were capitalized to prepayments and other assets and are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt 
the following represents our financial contractual obligations and commitments as of july  for the fiscal years through and thereafter and contractual cash obligations total thereafter in thousands scheduled principal payments under debt obligations       potential payments under letters of credit    payments due for lease obligations       forward exchange contracts   while we believe that we have adequate sources of funds to meet our liquidity needs  our ability to meet our obligations depends on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to many factors beyond our control 
key internal factors affecting future results include utilization levels of acquisition and processing assets and the level of multi client data library licensing  all of which are driven by the external factors of exploration spending and  ultimately  underlying commodity prices 
off balance sheet instruments our limited hedging program consists of off balance sheet instruments to fix the us dollar value of foreign currency payments to be made under a norwegian vessel charter and interest rate swap contracts that effectively fix the interest rate on million of our variable rate long term debt 
none of these hedges are critical to our operations but they reduce our exposure to currency and interest rate fluctuations and allow us to better plan our future cash flows 
these instruments are described in detail in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk as well as in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies while all of our accounting policies are important in assuring that we adhere to current accounting standards  certain policies are particularly important due to their impact on our financial statements 
these are described in detail below 
revenue recognition for contract work  we recognize revenue on a percent complete basis as work is performed 
this method requires that we recognize revenue based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers shot or processed 
during the acquisition and processing phase of a multi client survey  we recognize pre funding revenue based on percentage completion  similar to the method for contract projects 
after completion of a multi client survey  we recognize revenue upon delivery of data to our customer or the customer s designee 
multi client data library for our multi client data library  we collect and process geophysical data for our own account and retain all ownership rights 
we license the data to clients on a non transferable basis 
we capitalize costs associated with acquiring and processing the data as an investment in our multi client data library 
the capitalized cost of multi client data is charged to cost of services in the period sales occur based on the percentage of total estimated costs to total estimated sales multiplied by actual sales  a process called the sales forecast method 
any costs remaining months after completion of a survey are charged to cost of services over a period not to exceed months 
the total amortization period of months represents the minimum period over which benefits from these surveys are expected to be derived 
we periodically review the carrying value of the multi client data library to assess whether there has been a permanent impairment of value and record losses when it is determined that estimated sales would not be sufficient to cover the carrying value of the asset 
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal  we changed our multi client policy to include a minimum amortization from the date of survey completion  instead of only during the last months of survey book life 
however  the sales forecast method remains the primary method of calculating cost of services 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information deferred tax asset deferred taxes result from the effect of transactions that are recognized in different periods for financial and tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance  by tax jurisdiction  is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is then adjusted when the realization of deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not 
during fiscal  we increased our valuation allowances by million as the available evidence  including historical losses  did not support a more likely than not conclusion that this portion of our deferred tax assets would be realized 
adjustments are also made to recognize the expiration of net operating loss and investment tax credit carryforwards 
in the future  should available evidence result in a different judgment concerning the realization of deferred tax assets  further adjustments  up or down  to the valuation allowances will be made 
since our quasi reorganization on july  with respect to digicon inc  the tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization have been recognized through a direct addition to additional paid in capital  when realization is more likely than not 
additionally  the utilization of the net operating loss carryforwards existing at the date of the quasi reorganization is subject to certain limitations 
during fiscal  we recognized million related to these benefits 
software capitalization and amortization software available for sale is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
software acquired through the purchase of software companies is capitalized at estimated fair market value through allocation of the purchase price 
for internally developed software  we capitalize costs associated with the development of the product from the time the product reaches technological feasibility until it is ready for commercial release 
the capitalized cost of the software  whether developed or purchased  is charged to cost of services in the period sales occur based on the percentage of total cost to total estimated sales multiplied by actual sales during the period 
the period of amortization begins when the software is released to the market 
in no case is the cumulative amortization for a product allowed to fall below the amount that would be recorded using straight line amortization for that product s estimated useful life 
estimated useful lives of our software products range from three to five years

risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to a number of risks discussed below 
you should carefully consider these discussions of risks and the other information included in this report 
as a provider of geophysical technologies  our business is substantially dependent on the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas companies 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies are affected by several factors including actual and forecast petroleum commodity prices and the companies own short term and strategic plans 
these capital expenditures may also be affected by worldwide economic conditions 
should there be a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies the demand for geophysical services likely will drop and there will be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period 
recently  many of our customers have been using a substantial portion of their discretionary cash to pay down debt  buy back their stock  drill low risk prospects and maximize production from existing fields rather than exploring for new prospects 
we do not see any indications that this spending pattern will change much in the next to months 
weak demand or technological obsolescence could impair the value of our multi client data library 
we have invested significant amounts in acquiring and processing multi client data and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will recover all the costs of such surveys 
technological  regulatory or other industry or general economic developments could render all or portions of our multi client data library obsolete or reduce its value 
for example  in fiscal and fiscal we incurred million and million  respectively  in impairment charges related to slow moving surveys in our multi client library 
these surveys were found to be impaired for various reasons  including slow acreage turnover in the case of us land surveys  a border dispute in the case of a shetland faroes survey and excessive acquisition cost in the case of a gulf of mexico survey 
we are dependent on achieving and maintaining technological advances  which creates risks regarding technological obsolescence  requirements for substantial future capital expenditures  the unavailability of necessary technology and the failure of new technologies 
the development of geophysical data acquisition and processing equipment has been characterized by rapid technological advancements in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue 
we will be required to invest substantial capital in the future to maintain our technology 
furthermore  manufacturers of geophysical equipment may develop new systems that render our equipment  even if recently acquired  obsolete or less desirable  requiring significant additional capital expenditures 
since some of our competitors are themselves leading designers and manufacturers of seismic equipment  we may not have access to their technology 
even if critical new and advanced equipment is available to us  we may not have funds available or be able to obtain necessary financing on acceptable terms to acquire it 
further  any investment we may make in a perceived technological advance may not be effective  economically successful or otherwise accepted in the market 
we face intense competition in our industry  which could adversely affect our results 
competition among geophysical service providers historically has been  and will continue to be  intense 
competitive factors in recent years have included price  crew experience  equipment availability  technological expertise and reputation for quality  safety and dependability 
some of our competitors operate substantially more data acquisition crews and have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
these larger and better financed operators could enjoy an advantage over us in a competitive environment for contract awards and data sales and in the development of new technologies 
other competitors operate with extremely low overhead and compete vigorously on price in certain markets where that is the determining factor in awarding work 
these low cost competitors can have a competitive advantage over us in these markets 
high fixed costs could result in operating losses 
our business has high fixed costs 
as a result  downtime or low productivity due to reduced demand  weather interruptions  equipment failures or other causes can result in significant operating losses 
low utilization rates may hamper our ability to recover the cost of necessary capital investments 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could adversely affect our results of operations in any financial period 
our operating results vary in material respects from quarter to quarter and will most probably continue to do so in the future 
factors that cause variations include the timing of the receipt and commencement of contracts for data acquisition  customers budgetary cycles  the timing of offshore lease sales and the effect of such timing on the demand for geophysical activities  seasonal factors and the timing of sales of geophysical data from our multi client data library  which may be significant to us and which are not typically made in a linear or consistent pattern 
combined with our high fixed costs  these revenue fluctuations could produce unexpected adverse results of operations in any fiscal period 
we may be unable to attract and retain key employees  which could adversely affect our business 
our success depends upon attracting and retaining highly skilled professionals and other technical personnel 
a number of our employees are highly skilled scientists and highly trained technicians  and our failure to continue to attract and retain such individuals could adversely affect our ability to compete in the geophysical services industry 
we may confront significant and potentially adverse competition for key personnel  particularly during periods of increased demand for geophysical services 
in addition  our success will depend to a significant extent upon the abilities and efforts of members of our senior management  the loss of whom could adversely affect our business 
of relevance to this risk factor  our chairman of the board and chief executive officer  david robson  has announced his intention to resign and our board of directors has initiated a search for his replacement 
we face risks associated with our foreign revenue generating activities 
substantial portions of our revenues are derived from foreign activities and  as a result  significant portions of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
these revenues are impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  net assets reflected on the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries  and therefore on our consolidated balance sheet  are subject to currency fluctuations 
foreign revenues are also subject to special risks that may disrupt markets  including the risk of war  terrorism  civil disturbances  embargo  and government activities 
revenue generating activities in certain foreign countries may require prior united states government approval in the form of an export license and otherwise be subject to tariffs and import export restrictions 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign revenues and  in particular  adverse effects from foreign currency fluctuations 
we operate under hazardous conditions that subject us to risk of damage to property or personal injuries and may interrupt our business 
our seismic data acquisition activities involve operating under extreme weather and other hazardous conditions 
these operations are subject to risks of loss to property and injury to personnel from fires  accidental explosions  ice floes  and high seas 
these events could result in an interruption of our business or significant liability 
we may not obtain insurance against all risks or for certain equipment located from time to time in certain areas of the world 
the trading price of our securities could be subject to significant fluctuations 
the trading prices of our securities fluctuate 
factors such as fluctuations in our financial performance  and that of our competitors  as well as general market conditions could have a significant impact on the future trading prices of our securities 
the trading prices also may be affected by weakness in oil prices  changes in interest rates and other factors beyond our control 
these factors may have an adverse effect on the trading price of our securities 
our business is subject to governmental regulation  which may adversely affect our future operations or the accounting thereof 
our operations are subject to a variety of federal  provincial  state  foreign and local laws and regulations  including environmental laws 
we invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws and related permit requirements 
failure to timely obtain the required permits may result in crew downtime and operating losses 
because laws and regulations change frequently  we cannot predict the impact of government regulations on our future operations 
the adoption of laws and regulations that have the effect of curtailing exploration by oil and gas companies could also adversely affect our operations by reducing the demand for our geophysical services 
we follow the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states gaap as promulgated and or enforced by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission and other organizations 
gaap is subject to change  with such changes occurring at a rapid rate in recent years 
changes in gaap can affect the reporting of our future results 
for example  we do not currently expense stock options granted to our employees and directors 
it is possible that the accounting rules will change  directing us to expense stock options 
this could reduce the reported earnings of the company  as shown on a pro forma basis in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain provisions of our charter  delaware law and our shareholder rights plan may make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even in situations that may be viewed as desirable by our stockholders 
the general corporation law of the state of delaware contains provisions that may delay or prevent an attempt by a third party to acquire control of the company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that authorize the issuance of preferred stock  and establish advance notice requirements for director nominations and actions to be taken at stockholder meetings 
these provisions could also discourage or impede a tender offer  proxy contest or other similar transaction involving control of us  even if viewed favorably by stockholders 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would likely discourage a hostile attempt to acquire control of us 
cautionary statements about forward looking statements this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference contain forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these statements include statements incorporated by reference to other documents we file with the sec

our operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside our control  and any one of which  or a combination of which  could cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are disclosed in risk factors and elsewhere in this report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk at july   we had limited market risk related to foreign currencies 
in march  we entered into a contract requiring payments in norwegian kroner to charter the seismic vessel m v seisquest
