item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company provides services and equipment to the global offshore energy industry through the operation of a diversified fleet of marine service vessels 
revenues  net earnings and cash flows from operations are dependent upon the activity level of the vessel fleet that is ultimately dependent upon oil and natural gas prices that  in turn  are determined by the supply demand relationship for oil and natural gas 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the recorded values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the revenues recognized and expenses incurred during the reporting period 
the company s estimates and assumptions affect its recognition of deferred expenses  bad debts  income taxes  the carrying value of its long lived assets and goodwill  and its provision for certain contingencies 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of these estimates and assumptions continually based on a combination of historical information and other information that comes to its attention that may vary its outlook for the future 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management suggests that the company s summary of significant accounting policies  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the company s consolidated financial statements are described below 

table of contents revenue recognition 
the company s primary source of revenue is derived from time charter contracts of its vessels on a rate per day of service basis 
these time charter contracts are generally either on a term basis average three months to two years or on a spot basis 
the base rate of hire for a term contract is generally a fixed rate  provided  however  that term contracts often include escalation clauses to recover specific additional costs 
a spot contract is a short term agreement to provide offshore marine services to a customer for a specific short term job 
spot contract terms generally range from one day to one week 
marine vessel revenues are recognized on a daily basis throughout the contract period 
receivables 
in the normal course of business  the company extends credit to its customers on a short term basis 
the company s principal customers are major oil and natural gas exploration  development and production companies 
although credit risks associated with our customers are considered minimal  the company routinely reviews its accounts receivable balances and makes adequate provisions for doubtful accounts 
the company self insures potential hull damage and personal injury claims that may arise in the normal course of business 
the company is exposed to insurance risks related to the company s reinsurance contracts with various insurance entities 
the reinsurance recoverable amount can vary depending on the size of a loss 
the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
the company estimates the reinsurance recoverable amount it expects to receive and also estimates losses for claims that have occurred but have not been reported or not fully developed 
the company also monitors its reinsurance recoverable balances regularly for possible reinsurance exposure and makes adequate provisions for doubtful reinsurance receivables 
it is the company s opinion that its accounts and reinsurance receivables have no impairment other than that for which provisions have been made 
goodwill 
the company tests goodwill impairment annually at a reporting unit level  as required  using carrying amounts as of december the company considers its reporting units to be its domestic and international operations 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit is determined by discounting the projected future operating cash flows for the remaining average useful life of the assets within the reporting units by the company s related cost of capital 
impairment is deemed to exist if the implied fair value of the reporting unit is less than the respective book value of the reporting unit  and in such case  an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the difference 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of the implied fair value of each reporting unit  such as  future expected utilization and average day rates for the vessels  vessel additions and attrition  operating expenses and tax rates 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
the company performed its annual impairment test as of december   and the test determined there was no goodwill impairment 
at march   the company s goodwill balance represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
interim testing will be performed when events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
examples of events or circumstances that might give rise to interim goodwill impairment testing include significant adverse industry or economic changes  significant business interruption due to political unrest or terrorism  unanticipated competition that has the potential to dramatically reduce the company s earning potential  legal issues  or the loss of key personnel 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in such evaluation  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset  based upon the company s reasonable estimate of the remaining useful life of the asset  are compared with the amount recorded for the asset to determine if a write down may be required 
the company estimates cash flow based upon historical data adjusted for the company s best estimate of future market performance that is based on industry trends 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the long lived asset is reduced to the estimated fair value of the asset  based upon its estimated future discounted cash flows 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 

table of contents income taxes 
the company determines its effective tax rate by estimating its permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the company is periodically audited by taxing authorities in the united states and by the respective tax agencies in the countries in which we operate internationally 
the tax audits generally include questions regarding the calculation of taxable income 
audit adjustments affecting permanent differences could have an impact on the company s effective tax rate 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize such deferred tax assets  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
drydocking costs 
the company expenses maintenance and repair costs as incurred during the asset s original estimated useful life its original depreciable life 
major repair costs incurred after the original depreciable life that also has the effect of extending the useful life of the asset are capitalized and amortized over months 
major vessel modifications are capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the equipment 
the company schedules vessel drydockings when it is anticipated that the work can be performed 
the company s net earnings can fluctuate quarter to quarter due to the timing of scheduled drydockings 
vessel acquisition and construction programs on april   the company paid million in cash to ensco international incorporated to purchase its vessel gulf of mexico based marine fleet 
the cash sale was funded by a newly placed million term loan agreement with a group of banks that expires on july  the loan bears interest  at the company s option  at prime or federal funds rates plus 
or eurodollar rates plus margin of 
the mix of vessels the company acquired consists of five anchor handling towing supply vessels  six stretched foot platform supply vessels and supply vessels 
in conjunction with this acquisition  it was also agreed that  for a period of two years and subject to satisfactory performance  the company will provide to ensco all of its discretionary vessel requirements in the gulf of mexico 
the day rates to be charged under the arrangement are based upon predetermined pricing criteria 
the acquisition enhances the competitive posture of the company in providing anchor handling and towing supply services in the gulf of mexico and better positions the company for an upturn in the domestic market 
on january  the company entered into agreements with three shipyards for the construction of seven large platform supply and five large anchor handling towing supply vessels 
all of which are capable of working in most deepwater markets of the world 
the total estimated cost for the vessels is approximately million  which includes shipyard commitments and other incidental costs such as spare parts  management and supervision  and outfitting costs 
the new build program was initiated in order to better serve the needs of the company s customers in the deepwater markets of the world 
four of the platform supply vessels contracts were awarded to the company s shipyard  quality shipyards  llc  while the remaining eight vessels are being constructed at two shipyards in far east asia 
as of march   six of the seven large platform supply vessels have been delivered to the market for an approximate total cost of million 
quality shipyards  llc delivered the first vessel to the market during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the remaining three throughout fiscal all four platform supply vessels constructed at quality shipyards  llc were built to full jones act compliance 
a shipyard in singapore is still constructing one platform supply vessel 
the singapore 
table of contents shipyard delivered two vessels during the third quarter of fiscal and is expected to deliver the last vessel in april as of march   million has been expended on the remaining platform supply vessel of the total estimated million cost 
the five large anchor handling towing supply vessels under contract at a shipyard in far east asia are still under construction 
scheduled deliveries for the five vessels have been delayed 
the company expects the first vessel to be delivered to the market in late calendar year while the remaining four vessels are expected to be delivered throughout calendar year the company has fixed cost contracts supported by performance bonds with the shipyard and does not anticipate any cost overruns related to these vessels 
as of march   million has been expended on these five vessels of the total estimated million of commitments 
the company is also committed to the construction of one large  north sea type platform supply vessel which is being constructed in a brazilian shipyard and next generation supply vessels  ranging in size from foot to foot  for approximately million 
the company s shipyard  quality shipyard  llc  will construct three of the next generation supply vessels and two other shipyards will construct the remaining seven vessels 
the vessels are intermediate in size and are technically capable of working in certain deepwater markets  however  these vessels are being constructed in order to replace older supply vessels 
scheduled delivery of the vessels is expected to commence in april with final delivery in may as of march   million has been expended on these vessels 
during fiscal  the company announced that it was expanding its crewboat fleet 
the company purchased existing crewboats and assumed four new build contracts from crewboats  inc  a privately held  leading independent provider of crewboat services in the gulf of mexico  for approximately million 
two of the new build vessels were delivered to the market during fiscal for an approximate total cost of million 
scheduled delivery for the remaining two crewboats is expected to commence in june with final delivery in september no amounts have been expended on the remaining two crewboats of the total million commitment cost  as the individual vessels purchase prices are due upon delivery of the respective vessels 
also in fiscal  the company committed million to the construction of four  foot  state of the art  fast  crew supply boats that blend the speed of a crewboat with the capabilities of a supply vessel 
the first foot crewboat was delivered to the market during the fourth quarter of fiscal for an approximate total cost of million 
the vessel was constructed at a us shipyard that is currently constructing the remaining three vessels 
scheduled delivery for the three vessels is expected to commence in april  with final delivery in september as of march   million has been expended on the remaining three vessels 
during fiscal  the company entered into an agreement with a shipyard in holland to construct three water jet crewboats for an approximate cost of million 
scheduled delivery for the three vessels is expected to begin in august with final delivery in october as of march   
million has been expended on these vessels 
the table below summarizes the number of vessels that have been added to the company s fleet during fiscal and by vessel class and vessel type number of vessels added vessel class and type deepwater vessels anchor handling towing supply platform supply vessels replacement fleet platform supply vessels crew utility crewboats total number of vessels added to the fleet

of the total million of capital commitments for vessels currently under construction the company has expended million as of march  while the company has not formally committed to any future new build vessel contracts at the present time  other than what has been discussed above  the company anticipates over the next several years continuing its vessel building program in order to replace its aging vessels 
the majority of the company s supply and towing supply vessels were constructed between and as such  most of this vessel class exceeds years of age and will ultimately need to be replaced 
in addition to age  market conditions will also help determine when a vessel is no longer economically viable 
the company anticipates using future operating cash flows and borrowing capacities to fund significant capital expenditures over the next several years 
in addition to the vessel deliveries discussed above  during fiscal  the company took delivery of two large deepwater platform supply vessels one constructed in brazil and the other in norway for approximately million and took delivery of three foot next generation platform supply vessels for approximately million 
the company also entered into an agreement to bareboat charter one large platform supply vessel 
in fiscal  the company took delivery of three large platform supply vessels built in norway for a total cost of million 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company finalized the cash purchase of two anchor handling towing supply vessels for million 
the three large platform supply vessels and two anchor handling towing supply vessels are specifically designed and equipped for deepwater work 
throughout fiscal the company constructed and took delivery of four large traditional crewboats that were built at us shipyards for approximately million 
during fiscal  the company purchased eight vessels from the sanko steamship co  ltd 
for million in cash 
four of the vessels are large anchor handling towing supply vessels and four are large north sea type platform supply vessels 
in addition  throughout fiscal  the company purchased three large platform supply vessels for approximately million 
vessel dispositions during fiscal  the company sold one deepwater platform supply vessel and one crewboat to one of its owned unconsolidated joint ventures for million 
the company financed the million sale of the deepwater vessel  while the joint venture paid million cash for the crewboat 
the transactions resulted in a fiscal gain on sales of assets of million and increased the investments in  at equity  and advances to unconsolidated companies account by million 
during fiscal  the company sold its holding in its consolidated marine joint venture  maritide offshore oil services company sae  for approximately million  resulting in a million gain 
as a result of the sale  the international towing supply supply vessel count decreased by five vessels 

table of contents during fiscal  the company sold four vessels two offshore tugs and two crewboats to one of its owned unconsolidated joint ventures for million  of which million was financed by the company 
the transaction resulted in a gain on asset sale of million 
also during fiscal  the company sold its holding in its unconsolidated marine joint venture  national marine service nms  for approximately million  resulting in a million gain 
the after tax effect of the gain on the sale was million  or 
per share 
as a result of the sale  the joint venture vessel count decreased by vessels 
during the same period the company was building new vessels  the company sold and or scrapped vessels between april and march the mix of vessels disposed of includes towing supply supply vessels  crew utility vessels  offshore tugs and other vessels  primarily barges 
included in the vessel disposition count are the nms and maritide vessels discussed above 
vessels withdrawn from service the company withdraws from active service older  little used vessels at which time the vessels are removed from the utilization statistics 
vessel utilization rates are a function of vessel days worked and vessel days available for active vessels only 
the company did not withdraw any vessel from active service during fiscal during fiscal  the company withdrew vessels  primarily towing supply supply vessels  from active service 
eight vessels were withdrawn from active service during fiscal vessels that are withdrawn from active service are intended to be sold 
the company continues to dispose of its older vessels out of the active fleet and the withdrawn fleet that are not marketable due to obsolescence or are economically prohibitive to operate due to high repair costs 
general market conditions and results of operations offshore service vessels provide a diverse range of services and equipment to the energy industry 
fleet size  utilization and vessel day rates primarily determine the amount of revenues and operating profit because operating costs and depreciation do not change proportionally when revenue changes 
operating costs primarily consist of crew costs  repair and maintenance  insurance  fuel  lube oil and supplies 
fleet size and utilization are the major factors that affect crew costs 
the timing and amount of repair and maintenance costs are influenced by customer demands  vessel age and scheduled drydockings to satisfy safety and inspection requirements mandated by regulatory agencies 
whenever possible  vessel drydockings are done during seasonally slow periods to minimize any impact on vessel operations and are only done if economically justified  given the vessel s age and physical condition 
the following table compares revenues and operating expenses excluding general and administrative expenses and depreciation expense for the company s vessel fleet for the years ended march vessel revenues and operating costs relate to vessels owned and operated by the company  while other marine services relate to third party activities of the company s shipyards  brokered vessels and other miscellaneous marine related activities

table of contents marine operating profit and other components of earnings before income taxes for the years ended march consists of the following in thousands vessel activity united states international gain on sales of assets other marine services operating profit other income corporate expenses interest and other debt costs earnings before income taxes as a result of the uncertainty of a certain customer to make payment of vessel charter hire  the company has deferred the recognition of approximately million of billings as of march   million of billings as of march  and million of billings as of march  which would otherwise have been recognized as revenue 
the company will recognize the amounts as revenue as cash is collected or at such time as the uncertainty has been reduced 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal results of operations decreased as compared to fiscal due to a weak natural gas market in the us gulf of mexico 
the company s fiscal domestic results of operations were negatively affected by the retrenchment in development and capital expenditures in the us gulf of mexico that began in fiscal and which is discussed in detail in the comparison of fiscal to fiscal section below 
market conditions improved during fiscal as natural gas supplies declined due to a general reduction in drilling activity  drilling interruptions caused by tropical storm isidore and hurricane lili in the gulf of mexico  and as a result of increased demand due to severe winter weather 
all of these factors contributed to higher natural gas prices  but did not result in increased gas drilling in the gulf of mexico market 
although the reasons for the continuing low level of drilling and exploration activity are not fully known  the company believes that general uncertain economic conditions and concerns about the stability of natural gas prices are significant contributing factors 
nevertheless  current inventory levels for the resource continue to be tight and commodity prices continue to be at strong levels  which are positive indicators for increased drilling activity in the future 
the company s fiscal international results of operations benefited from attractive crude oil commodity prices and high consumer demand 
average day rates and utilization for the international vessel fleet remained relatively stable throughout fiscal although political unrest in venezuela during the latter part of fiscal did have a slight negative impact on revenues 
international vessel demand  which is primarily driven by crude oil production  is expected to remain steady as international exploration and production is expected to remain firm 
the us war with iraq in the middle east could obviously have an impact on future world oil supply and demand  but thus far has not had a significant impact on the company s revenues 
domestic based vessel revenues decreased as compared to fiscal due to lower utilization and average day rates 
the company s average day rates have not deteriorated to the low levels experienced during the last industry downturn due to management s strategic decision to attempt to maintain high day rates at the expense of lower utilization 
as a result of this decision  the vessel utilization rates in the us gulf of mexico are the lowest the company has experienced in over a decade 
utilization and average day rates for the towing supply supply vessels  the company s major income producing vessel class in the domestic market  decreased approximately and  respectively as compared to fiscal at march   the towing supply supply vessels experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  international based vessel revenues increased a modest as compared to fiscal due to higher average day rates and an increase in the number of active vessels operating internationally 
a two month long general strike that shut down oil production in venezuela that began in early december and lasted through early february which was led by the workers of the venezuelan government 
table of contents owned company pdvsa had a slight negative impact on international revenues 
in december  the company had vessels contracted with pdvsa 
the majority of the vessels ceased operations during the work stoppage  but continued to earn revenue on a per day basis as stipulated in the charter hire agreements or as agreed to by pdvsa representatives 
venezuelan operations resulted in approximately million of revenue during the strike 
total accounts receivable from pdvsa at march  were approximately million 
in november  the company purchased seven deepwater vessels that are currently fulfilling bareboat contractual obligations that existed at the time the vessels were purchased 
the bareboat charter agreements on six of the vessels will expire at various times over the next year  although in one of the agreements  the charter party has the option to extend the contract for an additional two years 
the remaining vessel has a contractual obligation that expires within four years 
in a bareboat charter agreement  the bareboat charterer leases a vessel for a pre arranged fee and is able to market the vessel and is also responsible for providing the crew and all other operating costs related to the vessel 
for the vessels that the company has under bareboat contracts  only revenue and depreciation expense are recorded related to the vessels activity 
as the company incurs no operating costs related to the vessels  the related bareboat day rates are less than comparable vessels operating under normal charter hire arrangements 
for fiscal year ended march   the seven bareboat chartered deepwater vessels experienced utilization and average day rates of approximately  the international based deepwater vessel fleet  excluding the bareboat chartered vessels discussed above  experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  for the fiscal year ended march  operating profit for fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of decreases in domestic based vessel revenues 
domestic operating profit decreased most dramatically due to a weak natural gas market in the us gulf of mexico 
domestic based operating costs decreased during fiscal due to general cost cutting measures that were implemented which resulted in a reduction of domestic crew and a decrease in the number of vessel drydockings performed 
in addition  the reduction in business activity reduced fuel  lube and supplies costs and other vessel operating cost 
during fiscal  international based operating profit decreased as compared to fiscal due to a slight decrease in utilization  the negative effects of the two month long work stoppage in venezuelan operations  and also due to a slight increase in international operating costs  primarily crew costs and fuel  lube and supply costs 
fiscal s gain on sales of assets was lower as compared to fiscal due to fewer vessels sales 
fiscal gain on sales of assets included a million writedown in the carrying value of certain vessels 
the writedowns were a result of reviewing the recoverability of the carrying values of the vessels that were withdrawn from active service 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal fiscal results of operations surpassed those achieved in fiscal due to strengthened world crude oil commodity prices 
throughout fiscal  opec adjusted crude oil production levels and successfully negotiated with several non opec oil producing countries to adjust their respective production levels in order to help stabilize and maintain crude oil commodity prices at levels that would sustain growth 
the higher crude oil prices resulted in international offshore drilling  exploration and production companies increasing their capital spending budgets 
international vessel demand  which is primarily driven by crude oil production  increased throughout fiscal as a result of the improved international market conditions 
domestic vessel demand  which is primarily driven by natural gas production  declined steadily throughout fiscal as exploration and production companies operating in the us gulf of mexico reduced their capital investments in the gulf 
the high offshore rig fleet utilization rates achieved during fiscal began to steadily decrease during the second quarter of fiscal and continued to decrease throughout the remainder of fiscal on the news that inventory levels for natural gas were increasing as a result of unseasonably moderate weather and economic slowdowns in the united states and globally 
the company s depressed vessel utilization rates in the us gulf of mexico were the lowest the company has experienced in well over a decade 
during fiscal  international based vessel revenues increased as compared to fiscal due to higher average day rates  utilization  and an increase in the number of active vessels in the international based fleet 
the number of active vessels in the international fleet increased as a result of an 
table of contents aggressive deepwater vessel acquisition and construction program that began during fiscal seventeen deepwater vessels have been added to the company s fleet since the beginning of fiscal  seven of which were fulfilling bareboat contractual obligations that existed at the time the vessels were purchased 
for fiscal years ended march  and the seven bareboat chartered deepwater vessels experienced utilization and average day rates of  the international based deepwater vessel fleet  excluding the bareboat chartered vessels discussed above  experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  for the year ended march  fiscal domestic based vessel revenues increased slightly as compared to fiscal as a result of higher average day rates 
average day rates increased due to strong demand for the company s vessels in the us gulf of mexico during the first quarter of fiscal that continued from fiscal however  during the second quarter of fiscal  vessel demand began to decrease and continued to decrease throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as offshore drilling and exploration in the us gulf of mexico waned 
the company was able to achieve solid average day rates throughout fiscal  although it did experience deterioration in vessel utilization throughout fiscal at march   the towing supply supply vessels  the company s largest major income producing asset in the us gulf of mexico  experienced approximately utilization and average day rates of approximately  operating profit for fiscal increased as compared to fiscal as a result of increases in vessel revenues 
crew costs increased during fiscal as a result of better market conditions and additional vessels in the international areas of operations 
repair and maintenance costs decreased from the fiscal level as fiscal included an unusually high number of drydockings resulting from an intense drydocking program the company initiated in order to ready its equipment for an expected improvement in demand for its vessels 
included in fiscal s gain on sales of assets is a million gain from the sale of the company s holding in its consolidated marine joint venture  maritide offshore oil services company sae  for approximately million and a million writedown in the carrying values of certain vessels that were withdrawn from active service and held for sale 
the writedown is a result of reviewing the recoverability of the carrying values of the vessels that were withdrawn from active service 
fiscal year s gain on sales of assets included a million gain on the sale of the company s holding in its unconsolidated marine joint venture  national marine service 
fiscal other income decreased as compared to fiscal because the company had less excess cash invested in short term  interest bearing securities than the previous fiscal year as a result of the use of the funds for vessel acquisition and new build programs 
vessel class statistics vessel utilization is determined primarily by market conditions and to a lesser extent by drydocking requirements 
vessel day rates are determined by the demand created through the level of offshore exploration  development and production spending by energy companies relative to the supply of offshore service vessels 
suitability of equipment and the degree of service provided also influence vessel day rates

liquidity  capital resources and other matters the company s current ratio  level of working capital and amount of cash flows from operations for any year are directly related to fleet activity and vessel day rates 
variations from year to year in these items are primarily the result of market conditions 
as a result of recent vessel purchases and cash expenditures for vessel construction programs  the company s cash balances at march  and are at considerably reduced levels compared to march  cash from operations  in combination with an available line of credit  provide the company  in management s opinion  with adequate resources to satisfy its current financing requirements

effects of inflation day to day operating costs are generally affected by inflation 
however  because the energy services industry requires specialized goods and services  general economic inflationary trends may not affect the

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk refers to the potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations and exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
the company is primarily exposed to interest rate risk and foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risk 
interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  interest income and interest expense 
the company s financial instruments that are exposed to interest rate risk are its cash equivalents and long term borrowings 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of the cash equivalent investment portfolio  the company does not expect any material loss with respect to its investments 
the book value for cash equivalents is considered to be representative of its fair value 
at march  the company had million of debt outstanding 
the outstanding debt represents unsecured borrowings from the company s revolving credit facility 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because the borrowings bear interest at variable market rates  which currently range from to percent 
monies were borrowed under the revolving credit facility to finance the company s new build program previously disclosed 
interest expense associated with the borrowings is being capitalized 
a one percentage point change in market interest rate of the company s debt at march  would change the company s interest costs by million annually 
foreign exchange risk 
the company s financial instruments that can be affected by foreign currency fluctuations and exchange risks consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables and trade payables denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company periodically enters into spot and forward derivative financial instruments as a hedge against foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and currency commitments 
spot derivative financial instruments are short term in nature and settle within two business days 
the fair value approximates the carrying value due to the short term nature of this instrument  and as a result  no gains or losses are recognized 
forward derivative financial instruments are generally longer term in nature but generally do not exceed one year 
the accounting for gains or losses on forward contracts is dependent on the nature of the risk being hedged and the effectiveness of the hedge 
the company enters into derivative instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its risk management objectives and does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes 
the company had no spot contracts outstanding at march   and the company had no derivative financial instruments outstanding at march  that qualified as a hedge instrument 
at march  the company had five forward currency derivative contracts outstanding totaling 
table of contents million 
the company had one forward contract outstanding totaling million that qualified as a hedge instrument at march  for full disclosure on the company s derivative financial instruments see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
because of its significant international operations  the company is exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange risk on all contracts in foreign currencies 
the company does not hedge against any foreign currency rate fluctuations associated with foreign currency contracts that arise in the normal course of business 
to minimize the financial impact of these items the company attempts to contract a majority of its services in united states dollars 
the company continually monitors the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in us dollar
