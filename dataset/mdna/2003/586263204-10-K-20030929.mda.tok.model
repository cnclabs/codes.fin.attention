item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes  are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following valuation of deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recognition of a valuation allowance for deferred taxes requires management to make estimates about the company s future profitability 
the estimates associated with the valuation of deferred taxes are considered critical due to the amount of deferred taxes recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining the company s future profitability 
deferred tax assets were  and at june  and  respectively 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets of the acquired business 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value 
goodwill was  at june  and other intangible assets consist primarily of patents and patent rights and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
we review these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  were  and  as of june  and  respectively 
results of operations years ended june  and june  revenues 
in the past several years  the company has focused on increasing the amount of value added products it provides to the marketplace  ie  products where additional processing is performed on basic nitinol wire  strip  or tube before it is shipped to the customer

index to financial statements special interest  and stent components manufactured for abdominal aortic aneurysms aaa in particular have become a significant driver of the company s revenue 
however  because the market for stent components is very dynamic and rapidly changing  the company has found it difficult to accurately forecast demand for its stent components 
delays in product launches  uncertain timing on regulatory approvals  inventory adjustments by our customers  market share shifts between competing stent platforms and the introduction of next generation products have all contributed to the variability in revenue generated by shipments of medical stent components 
revenues increased for the fiscal year ended june   to  from  for the year ended june   a net increase of  shipments of wire based medical stent components increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal and tube based medical stent components increased approximately  during the same period 
looking forward  memry anticipates that aaa stent component shipments will be significantly reduced in fiscal versus fiscal this anticipated lower level of shipments reflect both inventory adjustments by a major customer and new approved suppliers of aaa devices that compete with memry s existing aaa customers and do not buy product from memry 
other medical device component shipments  including products utilized in minimally invasive surgery and guidewire applications  increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal revenues from sales of arch wire  high pressure sealing plugs  and locking devices increased approximately  during fiscal compared to fiscal  and revenues from prototype development and r d activities increased  during the same period as compared to fiscal these revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in shipments of superelastic tube  utilized in coronary applications and for other peripheral stenting  and a decrease of  in other superelastic semi finished materials utilized in various industrial applications 
the company anticipates that increasing competition will put pressure on pricing for superelastic tube as well as other selected segments of the business during fiscal costs and expenses 
manufacturing costs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  an increase of  or 
the company s gross margin from sales decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this cost increase and margin deterioration of fiscal compared to fiscal is the result of poor manufacturing yields in both the company s wire and tube based aaa stent component businesses and a significant reduction in the percentage of high margin superelastic tube in the product mix and a significant reduction in the percentage of high margin superelastic tube in the product mix 
superelastic tube shipments declined because a major customer of the company that was a significant user of superelastic tube ceased production of a product 
the company does not expect superelastic tube shipments to recover to the fiscal year levels in the near future 
the company does not anticipate significant improvement in gross margins for the next six to nine months due to a weak forecast for aaa stent component demand and the resultant negative impact on manufacturing plant absorption 
competitive pricing pressure on certain segments of the superelastic tube business will also result in pressure on gross margins 
general  selling and administrative gsa expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in consulting  bonuses and legal costs 
the company incurred research and development expenses of  relating to its own internal products as well as the development of future products in fiscal compared to  during fiscal other expense decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in interest income associated with a higher cash balance along with a reduction in interest expense associated with a reduced level of borrowing 
income taxes 
the company recorded a tax benefit of  for fiscal versus a provision of  for the same period in fiscal this change is due primarily to a decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance during the second quarter of fiscal to recognize deferred tax assets at amounts considered by management  more likely than not  to be realized 
based on the company s recent history of profitability and its forecasts for future periods  management has estimated that operating loss carryforwards in the amount of  and other temporary differences will be realized 
net income 
the company s net income increased by  to  for fiscal due primarily to the recognition of the deferred tax asset  as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 in the amount of  this compares with the net income of  during fiscal years ended june  and june  revenues

revenues increased for the fiscal year ended june   to  from  for the fiscal year ended june   a net increase of  this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in sales of superelastic tube  utilized for medical applications 
superelastic tube sales increased approximately  between fiscal and fiscal this higher level of tube sales was primarily due to increased demand in several medical device procedural areas  particularly embolic protection  neurological  and orthopedic 
as noted above  the kink resistant and self expanding properties of nitinol have made peripheral stenting an attractive market for the company at this time 
higher levels of wire based stent component sales more than offset the reduction in tube based stent component sales netting an increase in revenue of approximately  for the category as a whole in fiscal revenues from sales of arch wire and high pressure sealing plugs increased approximately  during fiscal while microcoil and guidewire revenue increased approximately  these revenue increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in revenue from sales of various commercial and industrial products and actuators and a decrease of approximately  in revenue from sales of bra wire  antenna wire  and other semi finished wire applications 
costs and expenses 
manufacturing costs decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  a decrease of  or less than 
the company s gross margin from sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in sales of higher margin semi finished tube for medical applications and in sales of stent components 
in addition  manufacturing costs in fiscal were relatively high due to one of the company s most significant medical device component customers temporarily suspending shipments of its product in the first half of fiscal because the company believed the suspension to be temporary in nature  it decided to retain much of its skilled labor during the period of reduced shipments  thereby having a negative effect on the fiscal gross margin of the company 
in addition  fiscal included costs associated with memry europe  which was sold during fiscal see note to consolidated financial statements 
general  selling and administrative gsa expenses decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  or 
approximately  of the reduction is a result of lower gsa expenses following the sale of the company s european subsidiary  memry europe  in fiscal and the balance is primarily due to reduced spending on investment banking fees and other corporate costs 
depreciation and amortization decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  a decrease of  primarily attributable to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on july  total operating expenses in fiscal also included a loss of  resulting from the sale of memry europe see note to consolidated financial statements

the benefit for the fiscal year ended june   was minimal due to the net loss incurred
