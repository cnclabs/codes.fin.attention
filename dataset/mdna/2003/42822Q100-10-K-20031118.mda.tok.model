segments we have two reportable segments outsourcing we apply our human resources expertise and employ our integrated technology systems to administer our clients human resources programs benefits  payroll and workforce management 
our benefits outsourcing services include health and welfare such as medical plans  defined contribution such as k plans and defined benefit such as pension plans 
our recent acquisition of cyborg expands our outsourcing service offering to include payroll administration  allows us to provide our clients with a stand alone payroll service and  importantly  enables us to offer a comprehensive range of human resources outsourcing services 
our payroll services include installed payroll software and fully outsourced processing 
our workforce management outsourcing services include the outsourcing of workforce administration  rewards management  recruiting and staffing  performance management  learning and development  and talent management 
consulting we provide a wide array of consulting and actuarial services covering the design  implementation  communication and operation of health and welfare  compensation and retirement plans and broader human resources programs and processes 
while we report revenues and direct expenses based on these two segments  we present our offering to clients as a continuum of human resources services 
outsourcing since we first began providing outsourcing services in  we have made significant investments in technology  personnel and office space to build our capabilities and address market opportunity 
to maintain our outsourcing leadership position  we remain committed to making significant ongoing investments in technology  infrastructure  and people  in expanding our business and driving greater efficiencies 
with the investments that we have made in 
table of contents the benefits administration business to date  our recent acquisitions of cyborg and ntrc and investments in workforce management  we expect to be able to continue to improve our capabilities and attract new clients 
consulting in our consulting business  we are engaged by our clients to provide a wide range of human resources services 
we experience a high level of recurring work because of our clients annual needs for certain of our services  such as actuarial valuations of defined benefit plans and consultation regarding the processes of compensation review and health plan selection and negotiation 
certain of our consulting services  however  support more discretionary or event driven client activities  including the re engineering of a client s human resources policies  corporate restructuring and change eg mergers and acquisitions  and programs and projects designed to improve human resources effectiveness 
as we have seen in our business and industry  the demand for these services can be affected by general economic conditions  the financial position of our clients and the particular strategic activities they may be considering  and  therefore  is variable from period to period and difficult for us to predict 
sageo in january  hewitt holdings owners launched a new business  sageo  with the intention of creating a stand alone  internet based company that would provide a standardized set of health and welfare offerings to companies seeking less complex benefit solutions 
by the second half of fiscal  sageo had achieved reasonable sales success  however  hewitt holdings owners determined that it was not cost effective to operate sageo as a separate company since its stand alone costs would likely exceed revenues for an extended period of time and because sageo s services had become a logical extension of the hewitt offering 
in the quarter ended september   the decision was made to transition sageo s clients from sageo s website to the total benefit administration web interface 
stand alone company expenses were eliminated  sageo website development spending ceased and the sageo employees who worked within the stand alone sageo operation were terminated or redeployed 
at that time  since we had decided to discontinue the use of the sageo website  we wrote off our remaining investment in the sageo software resulting in a million non recurring charge 
sageo s clients continue to be served as a fully integrated element of the outsourcing segment 
we believe that in order to analyze the historical results of our business  it is important to understand the effect that sageo as a stand alone operation which it was during fiscal and fiscal had on our financial results 

table of contents in fiscal years and  sageo s operating losses were million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  during which time sageo first operated with a significantly reduced cost structure as a part of hewitt  sageo contributed million which includes a million reduction in an accrued liability established during fiscal to our operating income 
in fiscal  incremental operating costs for sageo were not significant in relation to our outsourcing segment or total consolidated results 
the annual results of sageo for the years ended september   and  are included in the following table sageo historical financial results in thousands year ended september  revenue before reimbursements net revenues operating expenses compensation and related expenses other operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses non recurring software charge total operating expenses operating income loss other expenses  net income loss before taxes and owner distributions in the quarter ended september   the decision was made to transition sageo clients from sageo s website to the total benefit administration web interface 
stand alone company expenses were eliminated and sageo website development spending ceased 
at that time  since we had decided to discontinue the use of the sageo website  we wrote off our remaining investment in the sageo software resulting in a million non recurring charge  and terminated or redeployed the sageo employees who worked within the stand alone sageo operation 
sageo operated as part of hewitt during the year ended september  sageo s income before income taxes in includes a million reduction in an accrued expense upon settlement of an obligation 
the accrued expense was established in fiscal excludes reimbursable expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenues revenues include fees generated from outsourcing contracts and from consulting services provided to our clients 
of our billion of net revenues for fiscal  was generated in our outsourcing segment and was generated in our consulting segment 
under our outsourcing contracts  our clients generally agree to pay us an implementation fee and an ongoing service fee 
the implementation fee may cover only a portion of the costs we incur to transfer the administration of a client s plan onto our systems  including costs associated with gathering  converting  inputting and testing the client s data  tailoring our systems and training our employees 
the amount of the ongoing service fee is a function of the complexity of the client s benefit plans or human resource programs or processes  the number of participants or personnel  and the scope of the delivery model 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  we recognize revenues for non refundable  upfront implementation fees evenly over the period between the initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term on a straight line basis 
indirect costs of implementation are expensed as incurred 
however  incremental direct costs of implementation are deferred and recognized as expense over the same period that deferred implementation fees are recognized 
if a client terminates an outsourcing contract prematurely  both the deferred implementation revenues and related costs are recognized in the period in which the termination occurs 
revenues related to ongoing service fees and to services provided outside the scope of outsourcing contracts are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  our fee is determinable 
table of contents and collectibility of our fee is reasonably assured 
ongoing service fees are generally billed and recognized on a monthly basis  typically based on the number of plan participants and services and often with a minimum monthly fee 
therefore  a weakening of general economic conditions or the financial condition of our clients  which could lead to workforce reductions and potentially participant reductions  could have a negative effect on our outsourcing revenues 
services provided outside the scope of our outsourcing contracts are typically billed and recognized on a time and materials or fixed fee basis 
losses on outsourcing or consulting arrangements are recognized during the period in which a loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contract or project losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct and a portion of indirect costs exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the arrangement 
estimates are continuously monitored during the term of the arrangement and any changes to estimates are recorded in the current period and can result in either increases or decreases to income 
our outsourcing contracts typically have three to five year terms 
however  a substantial portion of our outsourcing contracts may be terminated by our clients  generally upon to days notice  with the payment of an early termination charge 
normally  if a client terminates a contract or project  the client remains obligated to pay for services performed including any unreimbursed implementation charges 
our clients pay for our consulting services either on a time and materials basis or  to a lesser degree  on a fixed fee basis 
we recognize revenues under time and materials based arrangements as services are provided 
on fixed fee engagements  we recognize revenues as the services are performed  which is measured by hours incurred in proportion to total hours estimated to complete a project 
each project has different terms based on the scope  deliverables and complexity of the engagement  the terms of which frequently require us to make judgments and estimates about overall profitability and stage of project completion which impacts how we recognize revenue 
estimates are continuously monitored during the term of the engagement and any changes to estimates are recorded in the current period and can result in either increases or decreases to income 
deferred contract costs and deferred contract revenues for new outsourcing services  upfront implementation efforts are required to set up a client and their human resource or benefit programs on our systems 
the direct implementation or set up costs and any upfront set up fees are deferred and recognized into earnings over the life of the outsourcing agreement 
specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation are deferred and recognized as primarily compensation and related expenses evenly over the period between the initiation of ongoing services through the end of the contract term 
implementation fees may be received either upfront or over the ongoing services period in the fee per participant 
by deferring the upfront set up fees over the ongoing services period  all set up revenues are recognized evenly over the contract term along with the corresponding deferred contract costs 
as of september  and  net deferred contract costs in excess of deferred contract revenues totaled million and million  respectively 
we have reclassified deferred contract costs and deferred contract revenues to show the gross amounts separately on the consolidated balance sheets 
in prior periods  both short term and long term portions of deferred costs and revenues were recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets  non current other assets  advanced billings to clients and other long term liabilities 
as a result of the reclassification  total net assets and liabilities did not change  however  total assets and total liabilities and shareholders equity increased by equal amounts  or approximately million and million as of september  and  respectively 
additionally  at september   a small portion of the deferred contract revenues includes deferred revenue on payroll software maintenance agreements 
deferred contract costs and deferred contract revenues were the following at interim reporting dates in thousands june  march  december  june  deferred contract costs deferred contract revenues 
table of contents performance based compensation our compensation program includes a performance based component that is determined by management 
performance based compensation is discretionary and is based on individual  team  and total company performance 
performance based compensation is paid once per fiscal year after our annual operating results are finalized 
the amount of expense for performance based compensation recognized at interim and annual reporting dates involves judgment  is based on our quarterly and annual results as compared to our internal targets  and takes into account other factors  including industry wide results and the general economic environment 
annual performance based compensation levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the actual performance of the individual  team  or company 
as such  accrued amounts are subject to change in future periods if actual future performance varies from performance levels anticipated in prior interim period 
goodwill and other intangible assets on october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist with reviews at least annually 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting unit 
our estimate of future cash flows will be based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by other factors and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
client receivables and unbilled work in process we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our client receivables and unbilled work in process based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific client s difficulty in meeting its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  failure to pay amounts due to us or to others  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the client receivable to what we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other clients  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past write off history and the length of time the receivables are past due 
facts and circumstances may change that would require us to alter our estimates of the collectibility of client receivables and unbilled work in progress 
factors mitigating this risk include our servicing a diverse client base such that we do not have significant industry concentrations among our clients 
also  for the years ended september   and  no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues 
long lived assets held and used we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived asset are less than the carrying value  we recognize a loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the discounted future cash flows of the asset 
our estimate of future cash flows will be based on our experience  knowledge  and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by other factors and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
stock based compensation our stock based compensation program is a long term retention and incentive program that is intended to attract  retain and motivate talented employees and align stockholder and employee interests 
the program allows for the granting of restricted stock  restricted stock units  and nonqualified stock options as well as other forms of stock based compensation 
for additional information on stock based compensation  we refer you to note to the consolidated and combined financial statements

 accounting for stock issued to employees  and provide pro forma net income and net income per share disclosures for employee stock option grants as if the fair value method defined in sfas no 
had been applied 
as of september   nonqualified stock options to acquire a total of  shares of class a common stock were outstanding 
had we determined compensation cost for the stock options granted using the fair value method as set forth under sfas no 
 during fiscal and  we would have recorded approximately million and million  respectively  in additional expense  and reported net income of million and million  respectively 
the net earnings per basic and diluted share for the year ended september  would have been and  respectively 
the difference between the net diluted earnings per share as reported and the net earnings per share under the provisions of sfas no 
would have been for the year ended september  for fiscal  the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the period from may  through september   would have been million and the net loss per basic and diluted share would have been 
the difference between the net loss per share as reported and the net loss per share under the provisions of sfas no 
would have been in in december  approximately  shares  constituting of our outstanding restricted stock awards  vested  which included  restricted stock units that converted to class a common stock and additional paid in capital 
in june   shares  constituting of our then outstanding unvested restricted stock awards  vested  which included  restricted stock units that converted to class a common stock and cash 
as of september    shares of restricted stock and  restricted stock units remain unvested 
the related deferred compensation expense of million will be recognized as compensation expense evenly over the remaining vesting periods through june   and will be adjusted for payroll taxes and forfeitures 
estimates various assumptions and other factors underlie the determination of significant accounting estimates 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  known facts  current and expected economic conditions and  in some cases  actuarial techniques 
we periodically reevaluate these significant factors and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate  however  actual results may differ from estimates 
basis of presentation revenues revenues include fees primarily generated from outsourcing contracts and from consulting services provided to our clients 
revenues earned in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled work in progress 
billings in excess of revenues earned are recorded as advanced billings to clients  a deferred revenue liability  until services are rendered 
we record gross revenue for any outside services when we are primarily responsible to the client for the services  we change the delivered product  perform part of the service delivered  have discretion on vendor selection  or bear the credit risk in the arrangement 
we record revenue net of related expenses when a third party assumes primary responsibility to the client for the services 
additionally  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred are characterized as revenues and are shown separately within total revenue in accordance with emerging issue task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
similarly  related reimbursable expenses are also shown separately within operating expenses 
we refer to revenues before reimbursements as net revenues 

table of contents compensation and related expenses our largest operating expense is compensation and related expenses  which includes salaries and wages  annual performance based bonuses  benefits  payroll taxes  global profit sharing  temporary staffing services  training  and recruiting 
for all historical periods presented prior to may   compensation and related expenses do not include compensation expense related to hewitt holdings owners since these individuals received distributions of income rather than compensation when we operated as a limited liability company 
as a result of our transition to a corporate structure on may   hewitt holdings owners became employees and we began to expense their compensation and related expenses 
other operating expenses other operating expenses include equipment  occupancy  and non compensation related direct client service costs 
equipment costs include computer servers  data storage and retrieval  data center operation and benefit center telecommunication expenses  and depreciation and amortization of capitalized computer technology and proprietary software 
occupancy costs primarily include rent and related occupancy expenses for our offices 
non compensation related direct client service costs include costs associated with the provision of client services such as printing  duplication  fulfillment  and delivery 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of third party costs associated with promotion and marketing  professional services  advertising and media  corporate travel  and other general office expenses such as insurance  postage  office supplies  and bad debt expense 
other expenses  net other expenses  net primarily includes interest expense  interest income  gains and losses from investments  and gains and losses on asset disposals  shown on a net basis 
provision for income taxes prior to may   taxes on income earned by the combined predecessor limited liability companies were the responsibility of the individual hewitt holdings owners 
therefore  for periods ended on or prior to may   the historical financial statements do not reflect the income taxes that we would have incurred as a corporation 
as a result of our transition to a corporate structure on may   we became subject to corporate income taxes and began applying the provisions of the asset and liability method outlined in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
income before taxes and owner distributions and net income prior to may   we operated as a group of affiliated limited liability companies and recorded income before taxes and owner distributions in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as a result of our transition to a corporate structure on may   hewitt holdings owners who worked in the business became our employees and we began to include their compensation in our compensation and related expenses  we became subject to corporate income taxes and we started to report net income and earnings per share 
as such  the historical results of operations after may  reflect a corporate basis of presentation and are not directly comparable to the results from prior periods  which reflect a partnership basis of presentation

these results include the results of sageo shown in the table on page sageo reduced operating income as a percentage of net revenues by for the year ended september  income before taxes and owner distributions is not comparable to net income of a corporation because  due to our limited liability company form in these periods  i compensation and related expenses did not include compensation expense related to our owners since these individuals received distributions of income rather than compensation  and ii the company incurred no income tax

consulting net revenues increased by to million in  by to million in  and by to million in consulting net revenues in increased primarily as a result of the june acquisition of the benefits consulting business of bacon woodrow 
a portion of this growth was also due to favorable foreign currency translation from the strengthening of european currencies relative to the us dollar year over year and consolidation of our dutch affiliate upon purchase of the remaining interest in that affiliate in the first quarter of adjusted for the effects of these acquisitions and favorable foreign currency translation  consulting net revenues were flat in and increased in growth in retirement plan and health benefit management consulting in and was offset by declines in demand for our more discretionary consulting services in and to a greater extent in in  we experienced growth across the entire spectrum of our consulting services  including significant growth in international operations

additionally  the acquisitions of bacon woodrow  cyborg and ntrc increased compensation expense in and and the sageo business contributed million of compensation expense in the net increase in overall compensation and related expenses in over after the inclusion of estimated owner compensation and the exclusion of the non recurring charges in  was primarily due to the inclusion of bacon woodrow s compensation and related expenses  cost of living increases  increases in employee headcount from acquisitions  and increases in outsourcing personnel to support the growth of benefit administration outsourcing and workforce management

these increases were partially offset by lower telecommunications expenses in our outsourcing segment as compared to fiscal there was a million increase in other operating expenses in from  which primarily reflects the inclusion of bacon woodrow since the acquisition on june   along with increased spending in technology and maintenance expense in outsourcing  offset in part by lower depreciation expenses on computer equipment and lower software maintenance expenses 
adjusting for the effects of the acquisitions in and and sageo in  other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenues was in and and in the decrease as a percentage of net revenues in was primarily the result of revenue growing at a faster rate than other operating expenses and our leveraging prior technology and occupancy costs to support expanded and new business

the non recurring  non cash million compensation expense resulting from owners receiving more than their proportional share of total capital  without offset for those owners who received less than their proportional share in conversion of owners capital into common stock  was not deductible 
segment results we operate many of the administrative and support functions of our business through centralized shared service operations  an arrangement that we believe is the most economical and effective means of supporting the outsourcing and consulting segments 
these shared services include information systems  human resources  overall corporate management  finance and legal services  general office support and space management 
additionally  we utilize a client development group that markets the entire spectrum of our services and devotes its resources to maintaining existing client relationships 
the compensation and related expenses  other operating expenses  and selling  general and administrative expenses of the administrative and marketing functions are not allocated to the business segments  rather  they are included in unallocated shared costs 
the costs of information services  human resources and the direct client delivery activities provided by the client development function are  however  allocated to the outsourcing and consulting segments on a specific identification basis or based on usage and headcount 
operating income before unallocated shared costs is referred to as segment income throughout this discussion

excluding the effects of the acquisitions  outsourcing net revenues increased in in  approximately one half of our organic outsourcing net revenue growth was from the addition of new clients and the other half from expanding services with existing clients 
increased participant volume was offset in part by lower pricing on new client services and renewals as we saw continued softness in the us economy and a more competitive environment for outsourcing services 
approximately one quarter of our net revenue growth in was a result of adding new clients with the remainder of the growth from expanding servicing with existing clients

the decrease in margin in from primarily relates to our continued investment in the development of our workforce management service offering

consulting fiscal years ended september   and consulting net revenues were million in  million in  and million in net revenues increased by in  by in  and in consulting net revenues increased primarily as a result of the june acquisition of the benefits consulting business of bacon woodrow

table of contents quarterly results the following tables set forth the unaudited quarterly financial data for the periods indicated 
the information for each of these periods has been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and  in our opinion  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial results

see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements for fiscal 
on june   we acquired cyborg and on june   we acquired substantially all of the assets of ntrc 
as such  their results are included in our results from the respective acquisition dates 
during the month of june  the portion of the third quarter of during which we operated as a corporation  we also incurred several one time charges totaling million see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements for fiscal related to our transition to a corporate structure  which resulted in a net loss 
additionally  common stock has been weighted from the dates of issuance and not from the beginning of the periods presented 
in connection with our transition to a corporate structure on may   hewitt holdings owners who worked in the business became our employees and we began to record their compensation in compensation and related expenses 
we also became subject to corporate income taxes 
compensation for services rendered by hewitt holdings owners has not been reflected in the consolidated and combined financial statements for periods prior to our transition to corporate structure on may  prior to our transition to a corporate structure  we operated as a limited liability 
table of contents company and hewitt holdings owners were compensated through distributions of income rather than through salaries  benefits and performance based bonuses 
compensation expense of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively  related to the amortization of initial public offering restricted stock awards 
income before taxes and owner distributions as a limited liability company is not comparable to net income of a corporation because i compensation and related expenses does not include compensation expenses related to hewitt holdings owners since these individuals received distributions of income rather than compensation and ii we incurred no firm level income tax 
seasonality and inflation revenues and income vary over the fiscal year 
within our outsourcing segment  we generally experience a seasonal increase in our fiscal fourth and first quarter revenues because our clients benefit enrollment processes typically occur during the fall 
in contrast  within our consulting segment  we typically experience a seasonal peak in the third and fourth fiscal quarters which reflects our clients business needs for these services 
we believe inflation has had little effect on our results of operations during the past three years 
pro forma results of operations during fiscal  we completed several significant transactions 
we completed our transition to a corporate structure in may  and completed our initial public offering and the acquisition of bacon woodrow in june the following pro forma results give effect to all three of these transactions as if they had occurred on october   the beginning of fiscal  and exclude any non recurring adjustments  to allow for comparability 
fiscal year pro forma results have not been presented as supplemental information as we believe those results are not comparable to the current year results primarily because of the sageo operating losses incurred in and because the consulting business of bacon woodrow that we acquired in june did not operate as a stand alone business for the majority of fiscal year see note to the consolidated and combined financial statements for pro forma bacon woodrow results 
we believe that pro forma fiscal results provide more meaningful information for comparison with fiscal results 
current year results  as shown in the consolidated and combined statement of operations for the year ended september   include the effects of all three transactions and  as such  are not shown on a pro forma basis 
the bacon woodrow historical results in the following pro forma combined and consolidated income statements reflect bacon woodrow s results prior to the acquisition on june  as such  for the year ended september   the historical results for bacon woodrow reflect approximately eight months of bacon woodrow s results prior to the acquisition 
the historical results of hewitt for fiscal include bacon woodrow s results since june  the information presented is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that might have occurred had the events described above actually taken place as of the dates specified

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  we have not entered into hedging transactions  such as foreign currency forward contracts or interest rate swaps  to manage this risk due to our low percentage of foreign debt and restrictions on our fixed rate debt
