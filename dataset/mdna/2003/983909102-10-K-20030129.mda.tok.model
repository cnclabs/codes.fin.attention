item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we make forward looking statements regarding future events and our future performance and results 
these and other forward looking statements are not guarantees of performance  but rather reflect our current expectations  estimates and forecasts about the industry and markets in which we operate  and our assumptions and beliefs based upon information currently available to us 
forward looking statements can generally be identified by words such as expects  anticipates  targets  plans  believes  intends  projects  estimates  and similar words or expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties  which are difficult to predict 
thus  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in such statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such different results include  but are not limited to  those discussed below in this report under the heading outlook and risk factors  and in our quarterly reports on form q and other reports filed by us with the securities exchange commission 
consequently  investors are cautioned to read and consider all forward looking statements in conjunction with such risk factors and uncertainties 
further  all forward looking statements are subject to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of overview for the year ending october   we reported net income of 
million or 
per share diluted on revenues of million 
these results compare to net income of million or 
per share diluted on revenues of million in fiscal these results reflect the difficult market conditions that began in the first quarter of fiscal and continued into fiscal producing declines of nearly in year over year systems revenues 
these market conditions were marked by an unusually high degree of customer pessimism producing extended buying cycles and project deferments 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal when we found ourselves in a very difficult economic environment  we suspended most of our planned growth initiatives and primarily executed a set of short term  defensive tactics designed to achieve three goals remain profitable  generate sufficient cash flows to support our debt service requirements  and maintain and even enhance our core competencies that are our primary differentiators in the market 
we achieved these goals by carefully managing our headcount  controlling discretionary expenditures  and aggressively managing our accounts receivable and inventories 
in so doing  we have been able to retain the employees possessing the key skill sets related to the design and implementation of complex voice  data and integrated communications systems 
therefore  our ability to re institute our growth initiatives has not been compromised during the recent downturn 
results of operations year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
net income for fiscal was 
million compared to million in fiscal  a decline 
discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems and equipment were million in fiscal  a decrease from fiscal this decrease consisted of a decrease in systems sales to commercial customers of million or and a decrease in systems sales to lodging customers of million or 
these decreases reflect the market conditions present during fiscal in which customers severely curtailed capital spending on telecommunications related equipment 
these decisions by customers reflected an unusually high degree of pessimism regarding the overall economy  as customers perceive the need to use their available capital cautiously until a clear economic recovery is underway 
we believe that customers have  in most cases  deferred their buying decisions temporarily rather than canceling planned projects 
a significant portion of our commercial equipment sales continue to be derived from our business partner relationship with avaya  inc avaya 
avaya is pursuing a strategy of moving a greater portion of its revenues through its dealer sales channel 
with our unique  in house design capabilities and nation wide sales and implementation capabilities  we are well positioned to take advantage of this strategy and we carefully cultivate relationships with the avaya sales team 
under these arrangements  we take title to the equipment and then sell it directly to the end user customer  bearing the collection and warranty risks 
installation and service revenues 
revenues earned from installation and service related activities were million  a decrease from fiscal installation and service revenues are comprised of four primary segments installation  contracts  mac  and consulting 
installation revenues  which are derived primarily from sales of new systems  decreased in fiscal compared to the prior year 
contract revenues increased in fiscal contract revenues are derived primarily from our base of lodging customers who have contracts with us to maintain their phone and call accounting systems 
these revenues are relatively stable from year to year and provide us with a key source of profitability and cash flows 
these consistent revenues were the key to our remaining profitable during the market downturn we have experienced over the past two years 
mac revenues represent revenues we earn from customers for moves  adds and changes to their systems  or other services contracted for on a time and materials basis 
a portion of these revenues is affected by general economic trends as customers defer minor upgrades  expansions  and preventative maintenance projects during down business cycles 
consequently  mac revenues decreased in fiscal consulting revenues increased in fiscal reflecting our increased emphasis on providing professional services to customers as well as the increase in complex implementations completed 
gross margins 
gross margins were in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease consisted of a decrease in gross margins earned on systems sales to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and a decrease in gross margins earned on services revenues to in fiscal compared to in fiscal one of the primary factors affecting our gross margins on systems sales during fiscal was an adjustment we made to the reserve for inventory obsolescence 
during the third quarter  we increased the reserve for obsolete inventory by  this increase was charged to systems cost of goods sold in our financial statements 
without this non recurring adjustment  our gross margins on systems sales would have been 
the remainder of the decline in gross margins is related to a variety of factors including product mix  customer mix  and increasing competitive pressures 
our gross margins on sales of systems is dependent upon a variety of factors we sell a wide variety of products  some of which generate gross margins in excess of and some of which earn gross margins of less than  we sell to several different customer sets  some of which have pre negotiated contracts with avaya which result in lower margins for us  and as a distributor  we receive various forms of financial incentives from our suppliers and from avaya which can vary based on special promotions  product types purchased  the end user customer  seasonality  etc 
all of these factors contribute to the unpredictability of our systems gross margins 
in fiscal  in addition to the adjustment discussed above  we believe the decline in systems gross margins is also due to competitive pressures reflecting the poor economic conditions present during the year 
we believe that our gross margins on systems sales will continue to be under pressure and we expect gross margins on systems sales in fiscal to be similar to those earned in fiscal without the effect of the reserve adjustment 
the decline in gross margins earned on services revenues is directly related to the decline in sales of systems  which as discussed above  is the primary driver of the installation and professional services components of our services revenues 
a significant portion of our services costs of sales are relatively fixed headcount related expenses such as wages  benefits  payroll taxes  etc 
therefore  as our installation revenues have declined  our margins on this component of our services revenues have suffered in direct proportion 
also  we maintain a staff of professional design and implementation engineers who are highly trained and uniquely qualified technicians 
this group  known as our professional services organization pso  is key to our ability to design and implement complex  voice  data  and converged communications systems 
in addition  we have a group of microsoft certified software engineers who integrate complex software applications and perform operating systems administration aos for customers 
throughout the downturn in our business  we have made careful reductions in our overall headcount to remain profitable 
we have chosen  however  to maintain the pso and aos groups to be able to preserve our long range strategy 
while the aos group operates at small operating profit  this choice has had significant  negative implications on our services margins as most of the pso s efforts are expended in pre sales related design and quote activities 
without sufficient professional services fees generated by systems sales  the costs of operating the pso group must be covered by other more profitable components of the services organization 
however  as one of the primary differentiators between us and our competitors  we are committed to maintaining the pso group as long as possible and still remain profitable 
a final component to our gross margins is the margins earned on other revenues and our corporate cost of goods sold expenses 
other revenues represent sales and cost of goods sold on equipment outside the company s normal provisioning processes 
corporate cost of goods sold represents the cost of the company s material logistics and purchasing functions 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were million or of revenues in fiscal compared to million or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses reflects cost reductions totaling approximately million produced primarily by reduced headcount  salary reductions for officers and directors  and reduced marketing expenditures to adjust to our declining revenue base  reduced commission expense of million reflecting the decrease in gross profits  a non recurring adjustment to decrease the reserve for bad debts of  and reduced amortization expense of million due to our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas regarding the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill 
in the third quarter  we determined that our efforts to collect our accounts receivables had succeeded sufficiently that our allowance for doubtful accounts was significantly overstated 
as a result  we reduced the allowance by  in the third quarter 
this amount was recorded as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the balance of the reserve for bad debts at october  was  which we believe is adequate 
since april of  we have managed our operating expenses primarily by closely monitoring and managing our headcount and by implementing tight controls over discretionary expenditures 
we believe that our current sales  it  and administrative staffing levels are appropriate for our present activity levels and could support substantially increased revenue levels  thereby significantly increasing our profitability as revenue increase 
we adopted sfas as of november  upon adoption of this standard  we were required to conduct an initial test of potential impairment of the recorded value of goodwill on our balance sheet to be followed by annual tests for impairment 
impairment  as defined by sfas  is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
we completed the initial evaluation as of the date of adoption and the first annual test of impairment was completed as of october  to assist in the valuations  we hired independent valuation experts who conducted the testing in accordance with generally accepted appraisal standards and sfas  and performed such procedures as they considered necessary in their sole discretion 
the valuation experts performed various macro and micro economic analyses  reviewed our historical financial statements  interviewed various members of our management  identified comparable companies  and applied a variety of other valuation techniques 
fair value was determined by applying a weighted average to various generally accepted valuation methodologies  including discounted future cash earnings and market valuation ie quoted prices for sales of similar companies or securities 
in both the evaluations conducted to date  which were performed by separate appraisal firms  the results indicated that the fair value of our reporting units in which goodwill is associated was higher than their respective carrying values on our balance sheet 
therefore no impairment loss was recognized 
interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by million reflecting lower average debt levels 
also  during fiscal  we capitalized interest expense of  related to our oracle implementation project compared to  in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our overall bank debt by million through funds generated from operations 
net other income earned in fiscal represents the partial reversal of an acquisition related accrual set up during fiscal and interest income earned from sales type leases 
the amount of the non recurring accrual reversal recorded to other income was  we set up this accrual as part of the purchase of us technologies  inc in november  to reflect the fact that we were inheriting an aggressive tax position taken by ust 
at the time of the acquisition  we chose to accrue for the potential losses to be incurred if the tax position was overturned 
in consultation with our financial and tax advisors  we have monitored this matter since the time of the acquisition and we believed it was appropriate to reduce the accrual 
tax expense 
we have recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of in all years presented 
this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
our net income as a percent of revenues in fiscal was compared to last year 
this decline primarily reflects lower gross margins earned in fiscal as discussed above 
we believe that our current business model and debt levels would support a target operating margin of 
however  we will have to realize sustained growth in our revenues  primarily through increased sales of systems to commercial customers  and improved gross margins to reach this target 
year ending october  compared to october  net revenues for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  a decline 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million for the previous year  a decline 
discussed below are the major revenue  gross margin  and operating expense items that affected our financial results during fiscal systems sales 
sales of systems in fiscal were million compared to million in fiscal this decline sales of systems consisted of a decline in sales of systems to commercial customers of and a decline in sales of systems to lodging customers of 
the decrease in commercial equipment sales is the result of overall market conditions that deteriorated throughout the year 
beginning late in our first quarter  order rates for new equipment became erratic 
by the end of the second quarter  a clear decline in order rates was apparent and visibility into the near term was murky 
that condition existed throughout fiscal  as customers perceived the need to use their available capital cautiously until a clear economic recovery was underway 
sales of communications systems to the lodging industry also declined reflecting the recession being experienced in the overall us economy and  more particularly  in the lodging sector 
also  the decline reflects the fact that many hotels upgraded their communications systems during the year yk upgrade cycle and  therefore  did not perceive a need for new systems in fiscal finally  the events of september th had an immediate and negative impact on the lodging industry which lasted throughout fiscal installation and service revenues 
revenues derived from installation and service activities increased million or to million in fiscal this increase consisted of sales of professional services from our acquired networking and professional services organizations  partially offset by decreased revenues from installation activities due to lower equipment and systems sales as discussed above 
revenues earned from maintenance contracts were relatively constant 
gross margins 
gross margins earned in were compared to in fiscal this decline in gross margins consisted of declines in margins on each of our major revenue streams 
in general  these declines can be attributed to the overall decline in higher margin large systems projects in both the commercial and lodging market sectors as economic conditions have resulted in lower capital spending by customers 
the gross margins earned on commercial equipment sales were in fiscal compared to for the prior year 
the gross margins earned on lodging systems sales were in fiscal compared to in fiscal the gross margins earned on installation and service revenues for fiscal were compared to in the prior year 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we experienced a sudden and significant downturn in our business  which resulted in a dramatic decline in the margins earned on installation and service revenues due to their sensitivity to labor costs 
in response  we implemented a workforce reduction 
a significant portion of this reduction was targeted toward the installation and service workforce to restore the gross margins in this area 
operating expenses 
operating expenses  excluding amortization expense  were of total revenues in fiscal compared to in the year earlier 
this relatively consistent expense level was maintained through the workforce and other cost reductions in sales expenses and through efficiencies gained through continued integration of general and administrative activities of the acquired companies 
amortization expense reflects primarily the amortization of goodwill acquired in the four acquisitions completed in the past two fiscal years 
interest and other income 
interest expense consists of interest paid or accrued on our credit facility 
interest expense declined in fiscal by  or  primarily reflecting lower average interest rates experienced during the year 
other income and expense consists primarily of interest income earned from our sales type lease receivable portfolio 
interest income declined by  or in fiscal reflecting the maturing of the lease portfolio 
tax expense 
we recorded a combined federal and state tax provision of in all years presented 
this rate reflects the effective federal tax rate plus the estimated composite state income tax rate 
operating margins 
net income as a percent of revenues for fiscal was compared to in the prior year 
this decline primarily reflects lower gross margins earned in fiscal as discussed above and also relatively constant amortization expense between the two years 
while we were able to adjust most of our cost structure to reflect the reduced revenues earned  the amortization charge from goodwill is not dependent upon revenues 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  our operations generated million in cash flows from operations 
these cash flows included million generated from income and non cash expenses  million from reductions in trade accounts receivables and sales type leases  and million in net changes in other working capital items 
these positive cash flows were used to reduce our bank debt by million and for capital expenditures of million 
generating significant positive cash flows has been a key tactic we have employed during the market downturn of the past two fiscal years 
to achieve success in this area  we have focused great attention on the management of our accounts receivables and inventories to ensure that we are minimizing our investments in working capital and maximizing our debt reduction 
at october   our total bank debt was million and we had million available to us for working capital needs under our revolving line of credit 
as discussed above  despite the substantially lower revenues and profits experienced in the past two years  we ve been able to continue to generate substantial cash flows from operations through careful management of working capital 
as a result  all regularly scheduled principal payments have been made 
in late  concurrent with our expansion into the commercial market via an acquisition strategy  we put in place a credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
borrowings under this credit facility were supported by forecasted strong cash flows from our core lodging operations as well as from the acquired businesses 
consequently  the various financial ratio requirements that were incorporated into the credit facility as indicators of our financial condition were based on cash flows generated by earnings 
as discussed throughout this report  since early  our profitability has steadily declined due to difficult market conditions  we have therefore failed to generate sufficient cash earnings as defined in the credit facility to meet one of the financial ratio requirements as of october  our banks have waived this default and our availability under our working capital revolver has been extended to march  we will continue to not be in compliance with one or more of the financial ratio requirements contained in the credit facility until improvements in our revenues and earnings materialize 
we cannot give any assurances that our banking partners will continue to provide a working capital line of credit under these circumstances 
see credit facility and working capital under outlook and risk factors below for a further discussion of the risks associated with our credit facility 
although we typically have access to a variety of capital sources such as additional bank debt  private placements of subordinated debt  and public or private sales of additional equity  the availability of those sources at acceptable prices or at any price in some cases  is currently limited given our current level of earnings 
we continue to be focused on managing our working capital to maximize cash flows and managing our cost structure to remain profitable  while holding together the key technical and sales competencies which we believe as essential to our long term success 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires that long lived assets to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
sfas also expands the reporting of discontinued operations to include components of an entity that have been or will be disposed of rather than limiting such discontinuance to a segment of a business 
sfas excludes from the definition of long lived assets goodwill and other intangibles that are not amortized in accordance with sfas sfas is effective for our fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 which rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  sfas no 
 accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers  and sfas no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements sfas 
sfas also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
as a result of the rescission of sfas and sfas  the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
will be used to classify gains and losses from debt extinguishment 
sfas also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring which previously governed the accounting treatment for restructuring activities 
sfas applies to costs associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by sfas those costs include  but are not limited to  the following termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a benefit arrangement that  in substance  is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract  costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
sfas does not apply to costs associated with the retirement of long lived assets covered by sfas sfas will be applied prospectively and is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  early adoption is permitted 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared based on the application of generally accepted accounting principals in the us these accounting principals require us to exercise significant judgment about future events that affect the amounts reported throughout our financial statements 
actual events could unfold quite differently than our previous judgments had predicted 
therefore the estimates and assumptions inherent in the financial statements included in this report could be materially different once those actual events are known 
we believe the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
if different assumptions or estimates were used  our financial statements could be materially different from those included in this report 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues from sales of equipment based on shipment  which is generally easily determined 
revenues from installation and service activities are recognized based upon completion of the activity and customer acceptance  which sometimes requires judgment on our part 
revenues from maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the underlying contract 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we must make judgments about the collectibility of our accounts receivable to be able to present them at their net realizable value on the balance sheet 
to do this  we carefully analyze the aging of our customer accounts  try to understand why accounts have not been paid  and review historical bad debt problems 
from this analysis  we record an estimated allowance for receivables which we believe will ultimately become uncollectible 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we reduced our estimated allowance for bad debts by  because  in our judgment  our estimate was significantly overstated 
this amount was recorded as a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize our credit risks and believe that our current allowance for doubtful accounts is fairly stated 
realizability of inventory values 
we make judgments about the ultimate realizability of our inventory in order to record our inventory at its lower of cost or market 
these judgments involve reviewing current demand for our products in comparison to present inventory levels and reviewing inventory costs compared to current market values 
we maintain a significant inventory of used and refurbished parts for which these assessments require a high degree of judgment 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we recorded increases to our provision for obsolete and slow moving inventories of  and  respectively  reflecting our judgment that our provision was understated 
these amounts were recorded as an increase to systems cost of goods sold 
goodwill and other long lived assets 
we have a significant amount of goodwill on our balance sheet resulting from the acquisitions made in fiscal and as required by generally accepted accounting principals  we conducted the annual goodwill impairment review immediately after the completion of the fiscal year 
we engaged an independent valuation expert to assist us in this review and they determined that the value of our goodwill was not impaired 
the valuation process is very judgmental  principally in the preparation of financial forecasts  allocations of accounts to reporting segments  market premiums  control of ownership premiums  and discount rates 
we have recorded property  equipment  and capitalized software costs at historical cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization 
the determination of useful economic lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
accruals for contractual obligations and contingent liabilities 
on products manufactured or installed by us  we have varying degrees of warranty obligations 
we use historical trends and make other judgments to estimate our liability for such obligations 
we also must record estimated liabilities for many forms of federal  state  and local taxes 
our ultimate liability for these taxes depends upon a number of factors including the interpretation of statutes and the mix of our taxable income between higher and lower taxing jurisdictions 
outlook and risk factors our business and our prospects are subject to many risks 
the following items are representative of the risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could affect our business  our future performance and the outcome of the forward looking statements we make 
our financial results may not improve 
we expect our financial results to improve in fiscal over fiscal levels 
we believe these improvements will be derived from better execution by our sales staff  continued expansion of avaya s business partner program  our improved ability to design and implement complex systems  and modest improvements in economic conditions 
however  our expectations are subject to risks that these contributing factors may not occur  as well as numerous other risks which are discussed in more depth below 
our business is adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions in the united states and  in particular  market conditions for telecommunications and networking equipment and services 
since april   capital spending on the equipment we sell has been increasingly curtailed by the weak us economy 
this decline reflects businesses concern about their ability to increase their revenues and their profitability 
to counter this concern  these businesses have implemented significant cost reduction programs and have greatly reduced or even frozen capital spending projects 
if this situation continues  we may not reach the improved financial results we expect in fiscal if these conditions worsen  it is likely that we will have to implement our own cost reduction program to stay profitable and meet our debt obligations 
our business is heavily dependent upon avaya  our primary supplier of communications equipment for resale  and our long term strategy and success depends upon avaya s ability to transition their product line to higher growth markets in the telecommunications equipment industry and to compete effectively in these markets 
avaya is a market leader in traditional voice communications systems and is pursuing a strategy to transition their product lines to converged voice and data network products  customer contact management applications and unified communications applications  all of which are predicted to be higher growth markets in the future than traditional voice systems 
we believe that this strategy is sound and have based our long term strategy and success upon the future growth of this emerging market 
therefore  we are aggressively educating our sales and technical staffs as well as our customers regarding these emerging products and in particular  avaya products 
our success in this market  however  depends heavily upon avaya s ability to develop these new products on a timely basis and compete effectively with other manufacturers products in this market 
while our distributor agreement with avaya is non exclusive and we can and do represent other manufacturers products in the marketplace  we are heavily invested in avaya s products and distribution network at the present time 
for the past several quarters  avaya has suffered declining revenues and has posted substantial operating losses 
to date  avaya reports that it has continued to fund the critical research and development efforts that are essential to competing in the rapidly changing converged voice and data products market 
however  should avaya s financial condition deteriorate to the point that it can no longer continue to develop and introduce market leading telecommunications products  the impact on our long term strategy would likely be very severe 
as a result of these factors  we routinely evaluate the product lines and market position of other major manufacturers 
we believe that we could add an additional manufacturer s product lines if it became prudent to do so in the future 
however  doing so could create a disruption in our business and lower margins due to reduced purchasing power 
our operating results could be adversely impacted by changes in incentive programs offered by avaya 
avaya  like many major manufacturers  provides various financial incentive programs to support the advertising and sale of its products 
we receive substantial rebates through these common incentive programs to offset both costs of goods sold and marketing expenses 
we also receive commissions from avaya to sell their maintenance contracts 
these amounts are material to our operating results 
avaya has changed several of these programs for the coming fiscal year 
as a result of these changes  we believe that we could receive less incentive compensation in fiscal than we did in fiscal the actual magnitude of these changes on our financial results will be dependent upon the mix of products sold and our ability to expand our sales and marketing efforts in ways that are rewarded monetarily by these programs 
if avaya chose to reduce or eliminate its business partner program  our revenues would likely be significantly lower 
avaya markets its products to major us companies through its direct sales force 
the remainder of the us market is served primarily through avaya dealers  like us 
on some of its major accounts  avaya selects one of its dealers to assist in the fulfillment of the customer s order through its business partner program 
we have carefully positioned ourselves as one of a few favored business partners by building our in house design and implementation capabilities  providing nationwide implementation services  and through access to our x service center 
we aggressively market these capabilities and differentiators to the avaya direct sales force who generally select the business partners for their accounts 
revenues earned from customers in which we partner with avaya are a significant portion of our overall revenues 
therefore  our near term financial results are dependent upon this program continuing 
the introduction of new products could result in reduced revenues  reduced gross margins  reduced customer satisfaction  and longer collection periods 
we are selling a variety of new  highly complex  products which incorporate leading edge technology  including both hardware and software 
the early versions of these products  which we are selling currently  can contain software bugs and other defects which can cause the products to not function as intended 
we will likely be dependent upon avaya to fix these problems as they occur 
an inability of avaya to correct these problems quickly could result in damage to our reputation  reduced revenues  reduced customer satisfaction  and delays in payments from customers for products purchased 
we are connecting our products to our customers computer networks and problems with the implementation of these products could cause disruption to our customers entire operations 
unlike traditional  stand alone voice systems  our new products typically are connected to our customers existing local and wide area networks 
while we believe the risk of our products disrupting other traffic or operations on these networks is low  these products are new and unforeseen problems may occur which could cause significant disruption to our customers operations 
these disruptions  in turn  could result in reduced customer satisfaction  delays in payments from customers  damage to our reputation  and even reduced revenues 
we expect our gross margins to vary over time and increasing competitive pressures may erode our gross margins 
our gross margins are impacted by a variety of factors including changes in customer and product mix  increased price competition  and changes in shipment volume 
we expect these factors to cause our gross margins to be inconsistent as we make quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons 
also during economic slumps  price competition usually increases 
we believe the market for our products is going through such a cycle currently and that these pricing pressures are a factor in the declining margins earned on systems sales 
if the economy stays flat or declines further  it is likely that price will become an ever increasing competitive factor and result in lower gross margins on system sales 
it is likely that we will continue to be in default of one of our financial covenants under our credit facility 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  our net income in the fourth quarter of fiscal was insufficient to meet one of the financial covenants  the coverage ratio  contained in our credit facility 
we have made all scheduled principal payments on our debt and are in compliance with all other covenants as of the end of the year 
our lenders have waived this default 
it is likely that we will not be in compliance with the coverage ratio until improvements in our revenues and earnings materialize 
there can be no assurance given that our banking partners will waive future defaults and continue to provide a working capital line of credit under these circumstances 
furthermore  they could elect to demand immediate payment of our debt 
the occurrence of either of these events would create an immediate  critical situation for the company requiring us to forgo long range strategies and planning  and demanding that all of our focus and efforts be directed toward reacting to a challenge of immeasurable proportions 
if our revenues and net income do not improve  we may not have adequate or cost effective liquidity or capital resources to finance our business 
our revolving line of credit expires on march  it is likely that we will have to show continued improvements in operating results to extend the maturity of the line of credit 
in addition  in fiscal  we were able to reduce various working capital accounts to produce significant cash flows from operations  which was used mostly to reduce our debt 
most significantly  we reduced trade receivables  inventories  and sales type lease receivables through aggressive management of these accounts 
we will continue our close monitoring of these balances  but we will not be able to generate as much cash from working capital in fiscal as we did in fiscal should our financial results not improve and if we are not able to extend our revolving line of credit  our options for financing our business would be very limited in the current economic conditions 
in such circumstances  we would likely pursue more drastic tactics than previously employed 
such actions might include selling equity at a substantial discount to current market prices  delaying payments to vendors  and laying off key technical and managerial personnel 
if our dealer agreements with the original equipment manufacturers are terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  our business could be adversely affected 
we sell communications systems under dealer agreements with avaya  inc formerly lucent technologies and hitachi telecom  usa  inc we are a major dealer for both manufacturers and consider our relationship with both to be good 
nevertheless  if our strategic relationship with avaya  and to a lesser degree with hitachi  were to be terminated prematurely or unexpectedly  our operating results would be adversely impacted 
furthermore  in both the separate agreements that we have with avaya for distribution of products to the commercial and lodging markets and the agreement with hitachi  we must meet certain volume commitments to earn the pricing structure provided in the dealer agreements 
in addition  our relationship with avaya is administered through a joint agreement between us  avaya  and one of avaya s super distributors 
we receive specified pricing through our agreement with this super distributor which is based on certain volume requirements 
if we fail to meet any of these requirements  future profit margins could suffer 
we are dependent upon a few suppliers 
our growth and ability to meet customer demand also depends in part on our capability to obtain timely deliveries of parts from suppliers 
our agreement with avaya specifies the use of the super distributor from whom we purchase most avaya products 
while this supplier has performed effectively and has been relatively flexible to date  there is no assurance that the present general economic conditions or other specific conditions unique to the supplier will not cause an interruption in the supply of products in the future 
the success of our business depends significantly upon our ability to retain and recruit highly skilled personnel 
our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled and qualified technical and sales personnel is critical to our success 
competition for such employees in the rapidly changing telecommunications industry is typically intense  although the current economic conditions have temporarily eased some of this pressure 
as we have transformed our company into an integrated communications solutions provider  we have invested heavily the in the hiring and training of personnel to sell and service our new products and service offerings 
if we re unable to retain our skilled employees or to hire additional qualified personnel as needed  it could adversely impact our ability to implement our strategies efficiently and effectively 
we are faced with intense competition and rapidly changing technologies in the industry and market in which we operate 
the market for our products and services is highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technologies 
as the industry itself evolves and new technologies and products are introduced into the marketplace  new participants enter the market and existing competitors seek to strengthen their positions and expand their product service offerings 
there has been a trend toward industry consolidation  which can lead to the creation of stronger competitors who may be better able to compete as a sole source vendor for customers 
while we believe that through the expansion and transformation of the last few years  we are well positioned to compete effectively in the marketplace  our failure to maintain or enhance this position could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
if one or more of our significant lodging customers are unable to survive the recession within the lodging industry  our financial results may be negatively impacted 
also  we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in the weakened lodging market in particular 
as a result of the overall downturn in the economy in general and the recession in the lodging industry in particular as a result of the september th attacks  there continues to be uncertainty to the long term health of many of our customers 
through expansion into the general commercial market  we have divested the company from our previous dependence on this sector 
however  the lodging market remains an important part of our business and the financial failure of one or more of our significant lodging customers could have a material  negative impact on our financial results 
most of our sales are on an open credit basis  with payment terms which can range to days 
because of the current economic slowdown  our exposure to credit risks  especially among our lodging customers  has necessarily increased 
we might have to record a significant goodwill impairment loss in the event our business continues to decline 
under sfas  the new goodwill accounting rule  we are required to evaluate the fair value of each of our reporting units annually and determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value of those reporting units  and if so  an impairment loss is recorded in the income statement 
the determination of fair value is a highly subjective exercise and can produce very different results based on the assumptions used and methodologies employed 
it is likely that if our financial results continue to decline and if macroeconomic conditions continue to erode  we would have to record a non cash impairment loss in our operating statement 
the amount of such impairment is impossible to predict  but would likely be very material to our operating results and could represent and significant portion of our shareholders equity 
the successful completion of the upgrade to our technology infrastructure and information systems is critical to our ability to effectively and efficiently operate our business in the future 
also  implementation of the system will significantly increase our depreciation expense 
our success in navigating the current market will depend heavily upon our ability to assemble the necessary information to make informed decisions and implement those decisions quickly and effectively 
for the past months  we have been working on a major upgrade to our technology infrastructure and information systems 
this upgrade will result in a consolidation from four critical legacy systems to one 
due to constraints that we have imposed on capital spending  we have purposely slowed down the development of this system 
furthermore  at our current revenue and activity levels  conversion to this new system is not critical to our near term success 
however  we believe it is prudent to proceed with the conversion while our revenues are at these lower levels in anticipation of future growth 
while we are taking great care to properly plan this implementation and to test the solution fully prior to the conversion  there can be no guarantees given that the conversion will not disrupt our operations 
in addition  at the time we place the new information system into service  we will begin depreciating our investment in the system 
this depreciation will result in a pre tax  non cash charge to our earnings of approximately  per quarter based on the million currently invested in this project 
our targeted operating margins of may not be achievable 
we believe that our current business model and debt levels would support an operating margin of 
this target assumes that we can generate significantly higher revenues  earn higher gross margins  and operate our material logistics and general and administrative functions at about the same levels as we currently do 
these assumptions are not tested through past experience operating in the commercial sector of our market and may not be achievable 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
historically  our stock has not been widely followed by investment analysts and has been subject to price and volume trading volatility 
this volatility is sometimes tied to overall market conditions and may or may not reflect our financial performance 
due to the current negative perception of technology related stocks  our declining revenues  and the relatively small size of our market capitalization  we have seen interest from the financial community decline further during fiscal as a result  there is increased risk that our stock could experience even greater volatility from momentum trading by only a few stock market participants 
our business is subject to the risks of tornadoes and other natural catastrophic events and to interruptions caused by manmade problems such as computer viruses or terrorism 
our corporate headquarters and nsc is located in northwestern oklahoma  a region known to be part of tornado alley 
a significant natural disaster  such as a tornado  could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
any such event could also cause a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  acts of war or acts of terrorism could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruption to our economy and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results  and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we may be subject to infringement claims and litigation  which could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain products and services 
third parties  including customers  may assert claims or initiate legal action against our manufacturers  suppliers  customers or us  alleging that the products we sell infringe on another s proprietary rights 
regardless of the merit of a claim  these types of claims can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  or require us to enter into costly license agreements 
in some instances  a successful claim could prevent us from selling a particular product or service 
we have not conducted patent searches on the third party products we distribute  to independently determine whether they infringe upon another s proprietary rights  nor would it be practical or cost effective for us to do so 
rather  we rely on infringement indemnities given to us by the manufacturers of the equipment we distribute 
however  because these indemnities are not absolute and in some instances have limits of coverage  no assurance can be given that in the event of an infringement claim  our indemnification by the equipment manufacturer will be adequate to hold us harmless or that we will even be entitled to indemnification by the equipment manufacturer 
if any infringement or other intellectual property claim is brought against us and is successful  whether it is based upon a third party manufacturer s equipment that we distribute  or upon our own proprietary products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we are subject to a variety of other general risks and uncertainties inherent in doing business 
in addition to the specific factors discussed above  we are subject to certain risks that are inherent in doing business  such as general industry and market conditions and growth rates  general economic and political conditions  costs of obtaining insurance  unexpected death of key employees  changes in employment laws and regulations  and other events that can impact revenues and the cost of doing business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in interest rates 
we did not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes during the fiscal year 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to the risk of fluctuation in interest rates in the normal course of business due to our utilization of variable debt 
our credit facility bears interest at a floating rate at either the london interbank offered rate at october  plus or the bank s prime rate at october  
in an effort to manage the risk associated with variable interest rates  in november  we entered  into interest rate swaps to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with variable rate interest payments  on amortizing notional amounts of million 
at october   the notional amount included under the interest rate swap was million 
the pay fixed rates under the swap agreements are 
the receive floating rates for the swap agreements are month libor  resetting monthly 
the interest rate swaps expire in november variable rate debt outstanding at october   net of the swap agreements was million 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position or cash flows
