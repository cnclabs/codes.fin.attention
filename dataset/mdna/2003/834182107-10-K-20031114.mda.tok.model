item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for customer sales information 
backlog backlog consists of contracts or purchase orders with delivery dates scheduled within the next months 
at august   our backlog was approximately billion  compared with backlog of approximately billion at august  because customers may cancel or reschedule deliveries  often with little or no financial penalty  backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future financial results 
competition the ems industry comprises many companies  several of which have substantial market share 
we also face competition from current and prospective customers that evaluate our capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
we compete with different companies depending on the type of service or geographic area 
we believe the primary basis of competition in our targeted markets is proven execution  reliability  manufacturing technology  flexibility  continuity of supply  quality  responsiveness  value adding services  ability to serve global customers and price 
to remain competitive  we must continue to provide technologically advanced services  deliver solutions that integrate our range of services  maintain high quality levels  offer flexible delivery schedules  deliver finished products on a reliable basis  and compete favorably on price 
associates as of august   we employed approximately  associates worldwide  including approximately  temporary associates 
patents and trademarks we hold certain united states and foreign patents and patent licenses relating to certain of the processes and equipment used in our manufacturing technology  as well as certain of the products which we have designed and manufactured 
in addition  we have registered trademarks service marks in the united states and various other countries throughout the world 
some of these patents and trademarks are related to businesses which we expect to divest in fiscal although we do not believe that our trademarks  manufacturing processes  patents or license rights to which we have access infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  we cannot ensure that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future 
if such an assertion were to be made  it may become necessary or useful for us to enter into licensing arrangements or to resolve such an issue through litigation 
however  we cannot ensure that such license rights would be available to us on commercially acceptable terms or that any such litigation would be resolved favorably 
any litigation could be lengthy and costly and  regardless of its outcome  could materially harm our financial condition 
environmental matters we are required to comply with local  state  federal and international environmental laws and regulations relating to the treatment  storage  use  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials used in our manufacturing and service processes 
we are also required to comply with laws and regulations relating to occupational safety and health  product take back and product content and labeling 
failing to comply with these present and future laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand facilities  or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations  and could impair our relations with customers 
moreover  to the extent we are found non compliant with any of these laws and regulations  we may incur substantial fines and penalties 
we are committed to maintaining compliance in all of our facilities and to continuously improving our environmental practices 
we are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits for many of our facilities 
these permits  which must be renewed periodically  are subject to revocation if we violate environmental laws 
there can be no assurance that violations will not occur as a result of equipment failure  human error or other causes 
if a violation of environmental laws occurs  we could be held liable for damages  fines and costs of remedial actions  and our permits could be revoked 
any such revocation could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  and may adversely impact our results of operations 
we have been  and in the future may be  held liable for remediation of sites where our hazardous materials or those of companies we have acquired have been disposed of 
to date  these liabilities have not been substantial or material to our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe  based on our current knowledge  that the cost of any groundwater or soil clean up that may be required at any of our facilities would not materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
however  it is costly to remediate contamination  and there can be no assurance that any future remediation costs would not harm our business  financial condition and results of operations

table of contents item legal proceedings we are from time to time involved in various litigation and legal matters  including those described below 
by describing the particular matters set forth below  we do not intend to imply that the company or its legal advisors have concluded or believe that the outcome of any of those particular matters is or is not likely to have a material adverse impact upon our business or financial condition 
on september   one of our former employees filed a complaint against us in the superior court of the state of california  santa clara county  asserting two claims for wrongful termination 
the case is encaptioned ronald sorisho v 
solectron corporation et al  case no 
cv in the complaint  plaintiff alleges that he was wrongfully terminated by us in supposed retaliation for his alleged efforts to ensure that we timely recognized a charge for excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory in the technology solutions business unit 
plaintiff seeks compensatory damages in an amount not less than million as well as punitive damages 
we believe mr 
sorisho s claims of wrongful termination are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
we filed a motion with the court challenging the sufficiency of mr 
sorisho s complaint and  in response to this motion  mr 
sorisho filed an amended complaint in which he dropped one of his two original wrongful termination claims  but added a new claim for purported defamation based upon statements attributed to us in a news article regarding mr 
sorisho s allegations against us 
we tendered the defense of the defamation claim to our insurance carrier  and the insurance carrier has assumed the defense of the defamation claim  subject to a reservation of rights 
we are also continuing to vigorously defend against mr 
sorisho s wrongful termination claim 
on march   a putative shareholder class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our officers in the united states district court for the northern district of california alleging claims under section b and a of the securities exchange act of  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the case is entitled abrams v 
solectron corporation et al  case no 
crb 
the complaint alleged that the defendants issued false and misleading statements in certain of our press releases and sec filings issued between september  and september  in particular  plaintiff alleged that the defendants failed to disclose and to properly account for excess and obsolete inventory in our technology solutions business unit during the relevant time period 
additional complaints making similar allegations were subsequently filed in the same court and  pursuant to an order entered june   the court appointed lead counsel and plaintiffs to represent the putative class in a single consolidated action 
the consolidated amended complaint  filed september   alleges an expanded class period of june  through september   and purports to add a claim for violation of section of the securities act of on behalf of a putative class of former shareholders of c mac industries  inc  who acquired solectron stock pursuant to the october  registration statement filed in connection with solectron s acquisition of c mac industries  inc in addition  while the initial complaints focused on alleged inventory issues at the technology solutions business unit  the consolidated amended complaint adds allegations of inadequate disclosure and failure to properly account for excess and obsolete inventory at our other business units 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages on behalf of the putative class 
we intend to vigorously defend against the consolidated lawsuit 
there can be no assurance  however  that the outcome of the lawsuit will be favorable to us or will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may be forced to incur substantial litigation expenses in defending this litigation 
on march   we  all of the current members of our board of directors  and two former officers  were named as defendants in a shareholder derivative lawsuit entitled lifshitz v 
cannon et al  case no 
cv  filed in the santa clara county  california superior court 
the plaintiff alleges that he should be permitted to pursue litigation  purportedly for the benefit of the company  against the individual director and officer defendants for alleged mismanagement and waste of corporate assets during the period from may to the present  purported breaches of fiduciary duty  constructive fraud  abuse of control  and alleged violations of the california corporations code by certain of the individual defendants who sold some of their solectron stockholdings during the period from september through september on may   solectron and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the lifshitz complaint 
in the meantime  two substantively identical derivative lawsuits  entitled schactner v 
cannon  et al  case no 
cv  and nims v 
cannon  et al  case no 
cv  were filed in the same court on may and may  respectively 
counsel for the plaintiffs in all three suits subsequently advised the court that they would be filing a consolidated amended complaint  and accordingly  defendants motion to dismiss was taken off calendar pending the filing of the consolidated amended complaint combining the three lawsuits 
on june   the plaintiffs served their consolidated amended complaint now alleging that since january of all of the current members of solectron s board of directors  as well as four former officers and directors  purportedly breached their fiduciary duties and participated in or permitted constructive fraud  unjust enrichment  and alleged violations of the california corporations code 
the consolidated complaint alleged an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages  and sought the relinquishment of all profits realized by those individual defendants who sold solectron stock during the relevant period  together with statutory penalties under california corporations code section  which plaintiff alleged to be applicable to those sales of solectron stock 
we moved to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint because we do not believe plaintiffs have adequately alleged a basis for plaintiffs to appropriate for themselves the duties of our board of directors under applicable delaware law  and we believe the consolidated complaint contains various factual errors and legal deficiencies 
on october   the california superior court granted our motion to dismiss  but granted the plaintiffs an opportunity to try to cure the deficiencies in their consolidated amended complaint through a further amended complaint 
we anticipate that the plaintiffs will file a further amended complaint within the next days  after which we expect to seek dismissal of that complaint because we do not believe the plaintiffs can show a sufficient basis to allow them to appropriate for themselves the duties of our board of directors under applicable delaware law 
we may be forced to incur substantial litigation expenses in defending this litigation

table of contents critical accounting policies management is required to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported when we prepare financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  our accounting for contingencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible asset impairments  restructuring costs  and income taxes 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our net sales are primarily derived from product manufacturing including  but not limited to  pcba  sub system and system assembly and manufacturing of memory products and embedded systems 
we also offer services consisting of repair  warranty and end customer technical support services 
revenue from manufacturing services and product sales is generally recognized upon shipment of the manufactured product 
revenue from other services is recognized as the services are performed 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood and our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss in determining the necessity for  and amount of any loss contingencies 
estimated loss contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate information available to us to determine whether any such accruals should be adjusted 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand  as well as any other lower of cost or market considerations 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our regular reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are also impacted by our contractual arrangements with our customers including our ability or inability to re sell such inventory to them 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected or if our customers are unwilling or unable to comply with any contractual arrangements related to excess and obsolete inventory  additional provisions may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us and thereby reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is likely to be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are outstanding  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill we perform goodwill impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss has occurred 
such events or circumstances may include significant adverse changes in the general business climate or a prolonged depressed market capitalization  among others 
we perform the impairment tests at the reporting unit level  which we have determined to be consistent with our business units except for technology solutions and global services  which were disaggregated further into two reporting units each  resulting in a total of six reporting units 
the tests are performed by determining the fair values of our reporting units using a discounted future cash flow model and comparing those fair values to the carrying values of the reporting units  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we then allocate the fair value of the unit to all the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit s fair value was the purchase price to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires judgment at many points during the test including future revenue forecasts  discount rates and various reporting unit allocations 

table of contents other intangible assets our intangible assets consist primarily of supply agreements and intellectual property obtained from asset acquisitions 
intangible assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
such an asset is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the asset grouping including the intangible asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and ultimate disposition of the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds fair value determined using a discounted cash flow model 
while our cash flow assumptions and estimated useful lives are consistent with our business plans  there is significant judgment involved in determining these cash flows 
restructuring and related impairment costs we have recorded restructuring and impairment costs as we continue to rationalize our operations in light of customer demand declines and the current economic downturn 
these restructuring and impairment charges include employee severance and benefit costs  costs related to leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  owned facilities no longer used by us which will be disposed of  costs related to leased equipment that has been or will be abandoned  and impairment of owned equipment that will be disposed of 
for owned facilities and equipment  the impairment loss recognized was based on the fair value less costs to sell  with fair value estimated based on existing market prices for similar assets 
severance and benefit costs and other costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to january  were recorded in compliance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
severance and benefit costs associated with restructuring activities initiated on or after january  are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postemployment benefits  as we concluded that we had a substantive severance plan 
for leased facilities that will be abandoned and subleased  the estimated lease loss accrued represents future lease payments subsequent to abandonment less any estimated sublease income 
in order to estimate future sublease income  we work with an independent broker to estimate the length of time until we can sublease a facility and the amount of rent we can expect to receive 
as of august   the majority of our facilities we plan to sublease have not been subleased and  accordingly  our estimates of expected sublease income could change based on factors that affect our ability to sublease those facilities such as general economic conditions and the real estate market  among others 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets in certain jurisdictions resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in such jurisdictions in future periods 
we established a full valuation allowance for most of our remaining deferred tax assets and recognized a million charge during the third quarter of fiscal in previous reporting periods  we had provided valuation allowances for future tax benefits resulting from foreign net operating loss carryforwards and for certain other us and foreign deductible temporary differences where we believed future realizability was in doubt 
we had believed it was more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets would be realized principally based upon forecasted taxable income  generally within the twenty year net operating loss carryforward periods 
sfas no 
requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized  and further provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
we identified several significant developments  which we considered in determining the need for nearly a full valuation allowance recorded in the third quarter of fiscal  including the continuing market conditions  the absence of material growth in quarterly revenue levels  the necessity for further cost reduction actions to attain profitability  and the resulting inability to accurately predict sustainable profit levels in the countries in which the deferred tax assets arose sufficient to establish  to the requisite level of certainty  that we would be able to utilize those deferred tax assets 
as a result of our assessment  we increased our total valuation allowance on deferred tax assets arising from continuing operations to approximately billion at august  we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we reach a sustained level of profitability in the countries in which deferred tax assets arise 
results of operations for fiscal years  and continuing operations the following table summarizes certain items in the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the discussion following the table is provided separately for continuing and discontinued operations 
in fiscal  certain operations we plan to divest were classified as discontinued operations 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of operations include these results in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
information related to the discontinued operations results is provided separately following the continuing operations discussion 
in addition  we expect that certain operations which are presently included in the following discussion of continuing operations will  as a result of further divestment activity during the course of fiscal  qualify for classification as discontinued operations prior to the end of fiscal

the decreases were partially offset by revenues from our acquisitions completed in fiscal  including c mac industries  inc we were organized into four business units including global operations  technology solutions  global services and microsystems 
our largest business unit  global operations  provided  and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and technology solutions contributed  and of net sales  respectively  for fiscal  and global services contributed  and of net sales  respectively  in fiscal  and microsystems contributed and of net sales during fiscal and  respectively  and did not exist in fiscal global operations net sales were billion  billion and billion in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal of from fiscal primarily resulted from weakness in end markets for networking  communications  pc notebooks  and a customer s decision to move production of a gaming console back in house 
the weaknesses in these areas were partially offset by strength in our 
table of contents high end computing  semiconductor  test and consumer products in addition to our business and asset acquisitions during the past year 
the decrease in of from fiscal was due to continued weakness in customer demand  particularly in our telecommunications and networking sectors 
technology solutions net sales were billion  million and billion in fiscal years  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal of from fiscal was primarily due to increased demand for memory products and embedded computer systems resulting in business wins from new and existing customers 
the decrease in of from fiscal was principally due to sluggish demand and declines in average selling prices of memory components 
global services net sales were million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
net sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase primarily resulted from our acquisitions of magnetic data technologies in june and ibm s global asset recovery operations in the second quarter of fiscal the increase of in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to acquisition of artesyn solutions  inc and higher demand by customers for after sales support service provided by this business unit 
microsystems net sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase of in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to the acquisition of c mac in the second quarter of fiscal which contributed only three quarters results in fiscal international sales international locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the increase since fiscal has primarily been due to project transfers from sites in the united states to lower cost regions 
as a result of our international sales and facilities  our operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
see risk factors for additional factors relating to possible fluctuations of our international operating results 
while these dynamics have not materially harmed our results of operations  we cannot assure that there will not be such an impact in the future 
major customers net sales to major customers as a percentage of consolidated net sales were as follows years ended august hewlett packard nortel networks cisco systems ericsson less than our top ten customers accounted for of net sales in fiscal  of net sales in fiscal and of net sales in fiscal we are dependent upon continued revenues from nortel networks  cisco systems and hewlett packard as well as our other large customers 
we cannot guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could materially harm our results of operations 
we believe that our ability to grow depends on increasing sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations and on successfully attracting new customers 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be ensured 
in addition  we cannot assure that any of our current customers will continue to utilize our services  and if they were to cease using our services  our results of operations might be materially adversely affected 

table of contents gross profit continuing operations our gross margin percentages were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin percentage from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to project transfers from sites in the united states to lower cost regions 
this increase from fiscal was partially offset by inventory charges related to excess and obsolete inventory in global operations 
the decrease in gross margin percentage from in fiscal to in fiscal was primarily due to inefficiencies associated with reduced demand and inventory charges related to excess and obsolete inventory in global operations and technology solutions 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to excess and obsolete inventory in our global operations business unit  which was taken due to the continued depressed condition of the telecommunications market 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million to reduce the carrying value of excess and obsolete inventory 
this charge was related to excess and obsolete inventory identified in product oriented technology solutions and global operations 
for global operations  we anticipate a larger percentage of our sales may be derived from systems build projects that generally yield lower profit margins than pcba 
we expect most of our technology solutions sales may continue to be derived from turn key projects  which typically yield lower profit margins than consignment projects 
in addition  factors affecting technology solutions profit margins include the sales mix of specialty memory modules  standard memory modules  communication card products and embedded computer systems  as well as changes in average memory densities used in memory products 
in the foreseeable future  our overall gross margin will depend primarily on several factors  including but not limited to  product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  start up and integration costs of new and acquired businesses  percentage of sales derived from systems build and turn key projects  pricing within the electronics industry  component costs and delivery linearity  and the cost structure at individual sites 
over time  gross margins at the individual sites and for solectron as a whole may continue to fluctuate 
increases in the systems build business or turn key projects  additional costs associated with new projects  and price erosion within the electronics industry could harm our gross margin 
in addition  we have experienced component shortages in the past 
while the component availability fluctuates from time to time and is subject to lead time and other constraints  this could possibly have a negative impact on our sales and gross margins in the foreseeable future 
therefore  we cannot assure that our gross margin will not fluctuate in future periods 
sales of inventory previously written down or written off have not been significant and have not had any material impact on our gross margins to date 
selling  general and administrative expenses continuing operations in absolute dollars  our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal and decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to headcount and other sg a expense reductions resulting from our continued restructuring and cost containment activities  partially offset by higher sg a expenses resulting from our fiscal acquisitions  including c mac 
the increase as a percentage of net sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted from a large reduction in net sales and the benefits from our restructuring activities lagging behind the sales decline 
research and development expenses continuing operations with the exception of technology solutions  our research and development r d activities have been primarily developing prototype and engineering design capabilities  developing common tools for electrical  mechanical design  standardizing a single functional test platform  developing methods for handling  processing and re flow of high i o ball grid array  high reliability environmental stress technology and the implementation of environmentally friendly assembly processes such as lead free and no clean 
technology solutions r d efforts are concentrated on new product development and improvement of product designs through improvements in functionality and the use of microprocessors in embedded applications 
in absolute dollars  r d expenses have remained relatively consistent and were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a percentage of net sales  r d expense was  and of net sales for fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents restructuring and impairment costs continuing operations beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  we began a series of restructuring initiatives in light of the current economic downturn 
the measures  which included reducing the workforce  consolidating facilities and changing the strategic focus of a number of sites  have been intended to align our capacity and infrastructure to anticipated customer demand  transition our operations to lower cost regions  and rationalize our footprint worldwide 
in furtherance of the implementation of the restructuring plan  we expect to incur restructuring related charges in the range of an aggregate of million to million over the next few quarters  although no certainty can be attributed to this amount or the timing of its recognition 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure relative to our revenue levels and may take additional restructuring charges in the future 
if we incur additional restructuring related charges  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
total restructuring and impairment costs of million  million and million excluding goodwill and intangible impairments were charged against earnings during fiscal  and  respectively 
to date  we estimate that we have reduced our annual operating expenses by approximately billion 
these reductions relate primarily to reduced headcount  reduced expenses related to leased equipment and facilities and reduced depreciation 
we expect our previously announced restructuring activities to be completed by the second half of fiscal upon completion of our current planned restructuring activities  we estimate our annual operating expenses will have been reduced by approximately billion from earlier levels 
see note  restructuring  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our restructuring since initiation of the activities in fiscal goodwill impairment continuing operations goodwill impairment was approximately billion and billion for fiscal and  respectively  as a result of our goodwill impairment tests 
there was no goodwill impairment in fiscal see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
acquisition costs continuing operations during fiscal  we recorded million in acquisition and integration costs  which were primarily related to the nel acquisition and were not includable in the purchase price 
there were no acquisition costs in fiscal and goodwill amortization expense continuing operations we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective september   and discontinued amortization of goodwill beginning in fiscal the goodwill amortization expense of million in fiscal primarily resulted from the natsteel electronics ltd 
nel acquisition 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we purchased all of the outstanding issued share capital and convertible bonds of nel for approximately billion and million  respectively 
the nel acquisition was accounted for under the purchase accounting method and  as a result  we recorded approximately billion of goodwill that was amortized over ten years prior to our adoption of the new standard in fiscal interest income continuing operations interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the interest income decreases are due to yearly reductions in average cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances and average interest rates 
interest expense continuing operations interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the interest expense decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the retirement of approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity of our liquid yield option notes lyons during the past two fiscal years 
this decrease was partially offset by the issuance in fiscal of our adjustable conversion rate equity security units aces and senior notes due in the second quarter of fiscal for gross proceeds of approximately billion that bear interest at higher rates than the lyons 
the interest expense increase in fiscal primarily resulted from our issuance of the aces and the senior notes  which were used to repay lower interest lyons

table of contents other income net continuing operations other income for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal other income net primarily consists of gains on retirement of our lyons 
the following table provides the details of the retirement of our lyons due  lyons due and our lyons due in each period presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements in millions years ended august principal amount at maturity carrying value cash paid and payable gain included in other income net the remaining components of other income net fluctuate primarily due to foreign currency gains and losses and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
see basis of presentation and recent accounting pronouncements  of note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements  for further discussion of other income net 
income taxes continuing operations our income tax expense was million in fiscal we recorded income tax benefits of million in fiscal and million in fiscal arising from the losses incurred in those periods 
management s decision to provide a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets resulted in the tax expense incurred in fiscal our effective income tax benefit rates for continuing operations were approximately and in fiscal and  respectively 
our benefit rate in fiscal was less than the fiscal rate primarily due to our goodwill impairment  which is mostly nondeductible for tax purposes 
in prior years  the effective income tax rate had been largely a function of the balance between income and losses from domestic and international operations 
our international operations  taken as a whole  have been subject to tax at a lower rate than operations in the united states  primarily due to tax holidays granted to several of our overseas sites in malaysia  singapore and china 
the malaysian tax holiday is effective through july  subject to some conditions  including maintaining certain levels of research and development expenditures 
the singapore tax holiday is effective through march  subject to some conditions 
seven of our china sites have separate tax holiday agreements 
each agreement expires five years from the first profitable year for each site 
liquidity and capital resources continuing operations cash and cash equivalents decreased to approximately billion at august  from approximately billion at august  our restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are restricted primarily in connection with the terms of our leasing transactions and under the collateral obligations for our aces securities  which require an amount equal to the next quarterly interest payment 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily a result of the continued retirement of our lyons 
during fiscal  our primary uses of cash included using approximately billion of our available cash towards retirement of our lyons  which was partially offset by cash inflows  such as cash provided by operating activities of million including income tax refunds received of million and cash provided by investing activities of million 
accounts receivable decreased to approximately billion at august  from approximately billion at august   primarily due to a decrease in sales 
inventories decreased to approximately billion at august  from approximately billion at august   primarily from the sale of excess raw materials inventory back to our customers throughout fiscal and a million inventory charge related to excess and obsolete inventory in global operations during the second quarter of fiscal as of august   we had available a million revolving credit facility that expires on february   and a million revolving credit facility that expires on february  each of our revolving credit facilities is guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by the pledge of domestic accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  the pledge of equity interests in certain

borrowings under the credit facilities bear interest  at our option  at the london interbank offering rate libor plus a margin of based on our current senior unsecured debt ratings  or the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or bank of america na s publicly announced prime rate 
as of august   there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
we are subject to compliance with certain financial covenants set forth in these facilities including  but not limited to  capital expenditures  consolidated tangible net worth  cash interest coverage  leverage  liquidity  and minimum cash 
prior to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we obtained waivers to the minimum cash interest coverage ratio covenant for the quarter 
as a result of these amendments  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of august  on december   moody s investor s service and standard poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba and bb  respectively  with a negative outlook 
on march   standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bb with a negative outlook 
on may   moody s investors services downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba with a stable outlook 
on march   standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bb with a negative outlook 
on june   standard and poor s placed our corporate credit and other ratings on credit watch with negative implications 
on june   moody s placed our ratings under review for possible downgrade 
these rating downgrades increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving lines of credit  and may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future 
such capital raising activities may be on terms that may not be acceptable to us or otherwise not available 
in addition  we had million in committed and million in uncommitted foreign lines of credit and other bank facilities as of august  related to continuing operations 
a committed line of credit obligates a lender to loan us amounts under the credit facility as long as we adhere to the terms of the credit agreement 
an uncommitted line of credit is extended to us at the sole discretion of a lender 
the interest rates range from the bank s prime lending rate to the bank s prime rate plus 
as of august   borrowings and guaranteed amounts were million under committed and million under uncommitted foreign lines of credit 
borrowings are payable on demand 
the weighted average interest rate was for committed and for uncommitted foreign lines of credit as of august  we have purchased in the past and may continue to purchase in the future our remaining lyons on an opportunistic basis 
we repurchased lyons with approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity in fiscal for approximately billion in cash 
we repurchased lyons with approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity in fiscal for approximately billion in cash 
as a result  we have repurchased substantially all of the lyons due and the lyons due leaving only a portion of our lyons due outstanding 
based on the aggregate amount outstanding on august   holders of our lyons due november will have the option to require us to repurchase their notes on may  in an amount of per  principal amount for a total of approximately million 
our liquidity could be materially adversely affected if we purchase these lyons with cash 
instead of repurchasing these lyons with cash  we may elect to offer holders our common stock or a combination of our cash and common stock 
at the time of such election  it may be in the best interest of our shareholders to satisfy such obligation in cash 
however  we may not have sufficient available cash and we may not be able to finance the required amount on acceptable terms  if at all 
as a result  we may be required to satisfy such obligations with our common stock  which would be extremely dilutive at our current stock prices 
see risk factors we have significant debt leverage and debt service obligations 
conversely  satisfying these obligations with cash could impair our liquidity 
our subordinated aces debentures are due november  on or about august   the aces debentures will be remarketed and if the remarketing is successful  the interest rate will be reset at then current rates as described in the indenture and the proceeds from the remarketing will be used to satisfy the holders obligation to purchase our common stock in november if the debentures are not successfully remarketed  the interest rate will not be reset and we expect to use the pledged debentures to satisfy the holders obligation to purchase our common stock in november in addition  our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes is due on february  and our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes is due on march  during fiscal  we restructured our synthetic lease agreements relating to five manufacturing sites 
the synthetic leases have expiration dates in at the end of the lease term  we have an option  subject to certain conditions  to purchase or to cause a third party to purchase the facilities subject to the synthetic leases for the termination value  which approximates the lessor s original cost  or we may market the property to a third party at a different price 
we are entitled to any proceeds from a sale of the properties to third parties in excess of the termination value and liable to the lessor for any shortfall 
in connection with the restructuring of these synthetic leases  we provided loans to the lessor equaling approximately of its termination value 
these loans are repayable solely from the sale of the properties to third parties in the future  are subordinated to the amounts payable to the lessor at the end of the synthetic leases  and may be credited against the termination value payable if we purchase the properties 
the approximate termination values and loan amounts are million and million  respectively  as of august  in addition  cash collateral of million is pledged for the difference between the termination values and the loan amounts 
each synthetic lease agreement contains various affirmative and financial covenants 
a default under a lease  including violation of these covenants  may accelerate the termination date of the arrangement 
prior to the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we obtained a 
table of contents waiver to the minimum cash interest coverage ratio covenant for the quarter 
as a result of the amendment  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of august  monthly lease payments are generally based on the termination value and day libor index as of august  plus an interest rate margin  which may vary depending upon our moody s investors services and standard and poor s ratings  and are allocated between the lessor and us based on the proportion of the loan amount to the total termination value for each synthetic lease 
we account for these synthetic lease arrangements as operating leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
our loans to the lessor are included in other long term assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of august  if we should determine that it is probable that the expected fair value of the property at the end of the lease term will be less than the termination value  any expected loss will be recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining lease term 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  lines of credit and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure  debt service and investment requirements through at least the next months

in addition  we guarantee used and unused lines of credit and debt for our subsidiaries totaling million as of august  we also guarantee performance of certain of our subsidiaries in various transactions such as leases  totaling million as of august  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet arrangements consist of our synthetic and operating leases  subsidiary guarantees leases and subsidiary guarantees are both described in the liquidity and capital resources portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our interest rate swap instruments related to our long term debt described in the we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations risk factor  and our foreign exchange contracts described in the we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates risk factor 
a tabular presentation of our contractual obligations is provided in the liquidity and capital resources portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of a full review of our portfolio of businesses  we committed to a plan to divest a number of business operations that are no longer part of our strategic plan for the future 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have reported the results of operations and financial position of these businesses in discontinued operations within the statements of operations and balance sheets for all periods presented 
each of our four reportable segments included one of these operations  which are now classified as discontinued operations 
in addition  we expect that certain additional operations which are presently included in continuing operations will  as a result of further divestment activity during the course of fiscal  qualify for classification as discontinued operations prior to the end of fiscal the collective results from all discontinued operations for all periods presented were as follows 
table of contents years ended august net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income loss interest income interest expense other expense net income loss before income taxes income tax expense income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax sales and gross profit declined slightly in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the continued economic downturn that affected all of our operations 
this decline was partially offset by acquisitions during fiscal fiscal included a full year of operations for all the discontinued operations while fiscal included partial results 
operating expenses increased significantly in fiscal primarily due to approximately million of our goodwill impairment recorded during the third quarter of fiscal relating to the discontinued operations 
sales  gross profit and operating expenses increased significantly from fiscal to fiscal as only one of the discontinued operations existed prior to fiscal income tax expense increased significantly in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to approximately million recorded to establish valuation allowances against deferred tax assets related to the discontinued operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recorded as a liability in the period in which it incurs the obligation 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the primary objectives of sfas no 
are to develop one accounting model based on the framework established in sfas no 
for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale and to address significant implementation issues identified after the issuance of sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
on september  and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  adoption of sfas no 
has primarily resulted in changes to the timing of recognition of restructuring costs as previous accounting literature allowed recognition upon committing to an exit plan 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantees 
it also requires disclosure in interim and annual financial statements of its obligations under certain guarantees it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  adoption of fin no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the 
table of contents disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
during the third quarter of fiscal in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires variable interest entities  previously referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures  to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s returns or both 
the consolidation provisions of fin no 
apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after december  certain disclosure provisions apply in financial statements issued after january  we do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on its synthetic lease arrangements  as variable interest entities were not used in the transactions 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendments of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   with certain exceptions  and for hedging relationships designated after june  adoption of sfas no

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
financial instruments that are within the scope of the statement  which previously were often classified as equity  must now be classified as liabilities 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  adoption of sfas no

recent developments on september   we announced that mr 
ajay shah resigned as a director of solectron effective october  in order to devote more time to his personal business interests and investments 
on september   we announced that we reached an agreement with nortel networks to extend solectron s role as an electronics manufacturing services provider to nortel networks 
the new supply agreement  which replaces a four year supply agreement the companies signed in  defines new terms and conditions under which solectron will offer nortel networks a full suite of supply chain services  including design  new product introduction  materials management  manufacturing  product integration and testing  and repair 
additional product specific contracts will further specify terms as existing business is transitioned to the new contract and as new business is awarded 
the new agreement positions us to compete for nortel networks business over a broad range of product offerings  with actual annual volumes subject to the economic environment and competitive terms and conditions 
while the companies have announced their agreement and intention to work together under the terms of the new contract  there is no assurance that we will receive any particular level of revenues from nortel networks  that demand for nortel networks products will reach the levels contemplated by the parties  that solectron will be successful in its efforts to win additional business from nortel networks  or that solectron will be able to profitably supply products and services to nortel networks under the terms of the new agreement 
on october   we announced that mr 
dennis wood resigned as a director of solectron effective october  in order to devote more time to his personal business interests 
on october   standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b with a stable outlook 
on october  moody s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to b from ba with a stable outlook 
risk factors we are exposed to general economic conditions  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as a result of the economic downturn in the us and internationally  and reduced capital spending as well as end market demand  our customers and therefore our sales have declined significantly from prior years 
in particular  we depend on the telecommunications and computing industries  where the decline began in the second quarter of fiscal if there were to be continued or resumed weakness in these industries or any further deterioration in the business or financial condition of our customers  it could have a material adverse impact 
table of contents on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  if the economic conditions in the united states and the other markets we serve worsen  we may experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have significant debt leverage and debt service obligations 
for the fiscal years ended august   and  our fixed charges exceeded our earnings from continuing operations by approximately billion  billion and million  respectively 
the fixed charge excesses are primarily due to our operating losses 
we compute the ratio of earnings from continuing operations to fixed charges by dividing earnings available for fixed charges by fixed charges 
when the ratio is negative  we report the excess of fixed charges over earnings rather than a negative ratio 
the computations include our consolidated subsidiaries 
for these ratios  earnings represents loss before tax expense benefit and before adjustments for minority interests  plus fixed charges excluding capitalized interest  plus amortization of capitalized interest 
fixed charges consist of interest on all indebtedness and amortization of debt discount and expense  plus capitalized interest  plus an interest factor attributable to rentals under operating leases 
as of august   we had approximately billion of short term indebtedness  primarily consisting of our obligation related to our lyons due which are putable to us on may  and approximately billion of long term indebtedness 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of principal and interest on this outstanding indebtedness  as well as future capital expenditures and any increased working capital requirements 
we repurchased lyons with approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity in fiscal for approximately billion in cash 
we repurchased lyons with approximately billion aggregate principal amount at maturity in fiscal for approximately billion in cash 
as a result  we have repurchased substantially all of the lyons due and the lyons due leaving only a portion of our lyons due outstanding 
based on the aggregate amount outstanding on august   holders of our lyons will have the option to require us to repurchase their notes on may  in an amount of per  principal amount for a total of approximately million 
while we have the right to satisfy these obligations with shares of our common stock  because this could result in significant dilution to our stockholders  which in turn could significantly reduce our earnings per share  we are likely  given recent prices of our common stock  to choose to satisfy these obligations with cash 
satisfying these obligations with cash  however  could impair our liquidity 
in addition  the entire principal amount of million of our senior notes issued in february is due on february  and the entire million principal amount of our senior notes are due on march  we may not be able to meet our cash requirements because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our ability to meet our cash requirements including our debt service obligations is dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements from operations  we would be required to fund these cash requirements by alternative financings 
the degree to which we may be leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes  could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures  or could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes and opportunities in the electronics manufacturing industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing  that any such financing would be on acceptable terms  or that we will be permitted to do so under the terms of our existing financing arrangements 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  make future acquisitions  react to adverse operating results  meet our debt service obligations or fund required capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to sell excess or obsolete inventory to customers or third parties  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
the majority of our inventory purchases and commitments are based upon demand forecasts that our customers provide to us 
the customers forecasts  and any changes to the forecasts  including cancellations  may lead to on hand inventory quantities and on order purchase commitments that are in excess of the customers revised needs  or that become obsolete 
we generally execute supply agreements with our significant customers in our global operations business unit  which accounts for a majority of the inventory we purchase 
under these supply agreements  the extent of our customer s responsibility for excess or obsolete inventory related to raw materials that were previously purchased or ordered to meet that customer s demand forecast is defined 
if our customers do not comply with their contractual obligations to purchase excess or obsolete inventory back from us and we are unable to use or sell such inventory  our financial condition could be materially harmed 
some of our customers are in the telecommunications industry  an industry that in recent years has experienced declining revenue  large losses  negative cash flows  and several bankruptcies or defaults on borrowing arrangements 
there is a risk that these or other customers may not purchase inventory back from us despite contractual 
table of contents obligations  which could harm our financial condition if we are unable to sell the inventory at carrying value 
in addition  enforcement of these supply agreements may result in material expenses  delays in payment for inventory and or disruptions in our customer relationships 
we are responsible for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from inventory purchases in excess of inventory needed to meet customer demand forecasts at the time the purchase commitments were made  as well as any inventory purchases not made pursuant to the customer s responsibility under our supply agreements 
for inventory which is not the customer s responsibility  provisions are made when required to reduce any such excess or obsolete inventory to its estimated net realizable value  based on the quantity of such inventory on hand  our customers latest forecasts of production requirements  and our assessment of available disposition alternatives such as use of components on other programs  the ability and cost to return components to the vendor  and our estimates of resale values and opportunities 
these assessments are necessarily based upon various assumptions and market conditions which are subject to rapid change  and or which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
any material changes in our assumptions or market conditions could have a significant effect on our estimates of net realizable value  could necessitate material changes in our allowances for excess and obsolete inventory  and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
in addition  in the normal course of business  bona fide disagreements may arise over the amount and or timing of such claims  and in order to avoid litigation expenses  collection risks  or disruption of customer relationships  we may elect to settle such disputes for lesser amounts than we believe we should be entitled to recover 
in these instances  we must bear the economic loss of any such excess or obsolete inventory  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
for example  we recorded a charge of million related to excess and obsolete inventory in our global operations business unit during the second quarter of fiscal  and there can be no assurance that such charges might not be necessary in future periods 
our substantial debt could have material adverse consequences 
our substantial debt could have material adverse consequences 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service  thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other cash requirements  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  make it more difficult or impossible for us to make payments on indebtedness or obligations  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes and opportunities in  the electronics manufacturing industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors  and limit our ability to incur additional debt on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial indebtedness in the future  including our ability to borrow under our secured credit facilities 
if new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries current debt levels  the related risks that we and they now face could intensify 
the agreements governing our existing and future debt contain and will contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business 
the agreements and instruments governing our existing and future debt and our secured credit facilities contain and will contain various restrictive covenants that  among other things  require us to comply with or maintain certain financial tests and ratios and restrict our ability to incur debt  incur or maintain liens  redeem and or prepay debt  make acquisitions of businesses or entities  make investments  including loans  guarantees and advances  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  consolidations or certain sales of assets  engage in transactions with affiliates  
table of contents pay dividends or engage in stock redemptions  and enter into certain restrictive agreements 
our secured credit facilities are secured by a pledge of all of the capital stock of our material domestic subsidiaries  of the capital stock of certain of our material foreign subsidiaries  certain of our intercompany loans and certain additional assets  including inventory  accounts receivable and equipment of us and our domestic subsidiaries 
the covenants governing our secured credit facilities also restrict the operations of certain of our subsidiaries  including  in some cases  limiting the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us 
our ability to comply with covenants contained in our secured credit facilities and other indebtedness to which we are or may become a party may be affected by events beyond our control  including prevailing economic  financial and industry conditions 
our failure to comply with our debt related obligations could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness and cross defaults under our other indebtedness  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we obtained waivers related to the minimum cash interest coverage ratio covenants and amendments to our consolidated tangible net worth covenants applicable to various debt and lease agreements as described in liquidity and capital resources 
we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of august  even if we are able to comply with all applicable covenants  the restrictions on our ability to operate our business in our sole discretion could harm our business by  among other things  limiting our ability to take advantage of financings  mergers  acquisitions and other corporate opportunities 
most of our net sales come from a small number of customers  if we lose any of these customers  our net sales could decline significantly 
most of our annual net sales come from a small number of our customers 
our ten largest customers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of net sales from continuing operations in fiscal  and some of these customers individually account for more than ten percent of our annual net sales 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of orders from these or other major customers could cause our net sales to decline significantly  and we may not be able to reduce the accompanying expenses at the same time 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to retain any of our largest customers or any other accounts  or that we will be able to realize the expected revenues under existing or anticipated supply agreements with these customers 
our business  market share  financial condition and results of operations will continue to depend significantly on our ability to obtain orders from new customers  retain existing customers  realize expected revenues under existing and anticipated supply agreements  as well as on the financial condition and success of our customers and their customers 
net sales may not improve  and could decline  in future periods if there is continued or resumed weakness in customer demand  particularly in the telecommunications and computing sectors  resulting from worldwide economic conditions 
in addition  net sales were adversely affected due to our unwinding of our optical products supply agreement with lucent during fiscal  which had previously been expected to generate billion in revenues over the original three year contract period 
sales  gross profit and operating loss from this supply agreement were million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal production under this supply agreement substantially ceased in march our customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or locations  or delay production 
to remain competitive  ems companies must provide increasingly rapid product turnaround  at increasingly competitive prices  for their customers 
we generally do not have long term contractual commitments from our top customers 
as a result  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to receive any net sales from our customers 
customers may cancel their orders  change production quantities or delay production for a number of reasons 
many of our customers industries have recently experienced a significant decrease in demand for their products and services  as well as substantial price competition 
the generally uncertain economic condition of several of our customers industries has resulted  and may continue to result  in some of our customers delaying purchases on some of the products we manufacture for them  and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated 
cancellations  reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers would seriously harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products manufactured by us for the customers and delivered in that period  as well as causing a delay in the repayment of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and lower asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins 
in addition  customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to another to achieve cost and other objectives 
such transfers  if unanticipated or not flawlessly executed  can result in various inefficiencies and costs  including excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and related strains on our resources at the other  disruption and delays in product deliveries and sales  deterioration in product quality and customer satisfaction  and increased manufacturing and scrap costs 

table of contents our strategic relationships with major customers create risks 
in the past several years  we completed several strategic transactions with oem customers 
under these arrangements  we generally acquired inventory  equipment and other assets from the oem  and leased or in some cases acquired their manufacturing facilities  while simultaneously entering into multi year supply agreements for the production of their products 
there has been strong competition among ems companies for these transactions  and this competition may continue to be a factor in customers selection of their ems providers 
these transactions contributed to a significant portion of our past revenue growth  as well as to a significant portion of our more recent restructuring charges and goodwill and intangible asset impairments 
while we do not anticipate our acquisitions of oem plants and equipment in the near future to return to the levels at which they occurred in the recent past  there may be occasions on which we determine it to be advantageous to complete acquisitions in selected geographic and or industry markets 
as part of such arrangements  we would typically enter into supply agreements with the divesting oems  but such agreements generally do not require any minimum volumes of purchases by the oem and the actual volume of purchases may be less than anticipated 
arrangements which may be entered into with divesting oems typically would involve many risks  including the following we may pay a purchase price to the divesting oems that exceeds the value we are ultimately able to realize from the future business of the oem  the integration into our business of the acquired assets and facilities may be time consuming and costly  we  rather than the divesting oem  would bear the risk of excess capacity  we may not achieve anticipated cost reductions and efficiencies  we may be unable to meet the expectations of the oem as to volume  product quality  timeliness and cost reductions  and if demand for the oem s products declines  the oem may reduce its volume of purchases  and we may not be able to sufficiently reduce the expenses of operating the facility or use the facility to provide services to other oems  and we might find it appropriate to close  rather than continue to operate  the facility  and any such actions would require us to incur significant restructuring and or impairment charges 
as a result of these and other risks  we may be unable to achieve anticipated levels of profitability under such arrangements and they may not result in material revenues or contribute positively to our earnings 
additionally  other oems may not wish to obtain logistics or operations management services from us 
if we are unable to manage our acquisitions and divestitures  and cost effectively run our operations and dispose of non strategic assets  our profitability could be adversely affected 
until fiscal  we experienced rapid growth over many years 
during fiscal  we completed our acquisition of c mac  as well as other smaller transactions 
while we may consider future acquisitions of companies and strategic assets on a selective basis  subject to compliance with any restrictions that may exist under certain of our financing instruments  we are presently focused on divestiture activity 
we are in the process of divesting certain parts of our current operations that we do not believe to be strategic or synergistic to our primary business focus  and we believe such divestments  if successfully and timely completed at the presently anticipated valuations and without undue disruption of operations  present us with the opportunity to improve our liquidity and reduce our interest and operating expenses 
in order to achieve anticipated revenue and other financial performance targets  we must continue to manage our assets and operations efficiently while simultaneously preparing parts of our operations for divestiture 
our divestiture activities are expected to place a heavy strain on various personnel and management resources  and must be carefully managed in order to avoid or minimize disruptions in the business operations of the affected businesses  customer relations and cash flows  and to enable us to maximize the value which we may be able to realize from the divestments 
there can be no assurance that such divestment activities will be able to be consummated without an adverse impact on the near term operations of the affected businesses or on solectron as a whole 
any failure to successfully manage and consummate the divestments in a timely manner could harm our financial condition and results of operations  as well as adversely impact the realizable value of the divested operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing the presently anticipated benefits from our divestment activities  as such transactions involve significant risks and uncertainties with respect to valuation of the entities to be divested  particularly given the potential disruption of operations inherent in the divestiture process  and may result in significant costs  expenses and charges that may significantly reduce the value which we may realize in connection with the anticipated divestiture transactions 
in the event we fail to consummate a divestment  we may need to incur restructuring charges 
our ability to manage and integrate our acquisitions  as well as any future acquisitions  will require progressive increases in manufacturing and logistics infrastructure  as well as enhancements or upgrades of accounting and other internal management systems and the implementation of a variety of procedures and controls 
we cannot guarantee that significant problems in these areas will not occur 
any failure to enhance or expand these systems and implement such procedures and controls in an efficient manner and at a pace consistent with 
table of contents our business activities could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we may experience inefficiencies from the management of geographically dispersed facilities and incur substantial infrastructure and working capital costs 
we incurred approximately billion including goodwill and other intangible impairment charges of approximately billion of restructuring and impairment costs relating to continuing operations in fiscal and approximately billion including goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately billion during fiscal see also the risk factor entitled if we incur more restructuring related charges than currently anticipated  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
possible fluctuation of operating results from quarter to quarter and factors out of our control could affect the market price of our securities 
our quarterly earnings and or stock price may fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors including the following differences in the profitability of the types of manufacturing services we provide 
for example  high velocity and low complexity printed circuit boards and systems assembly services have lower gross margins than low volume complex printed circuit boards and systems assembly services  our ability to maximize the hours of use of our equipment and facilities is dependent on the duration of the production run time for each job and customer  the amount of automation that we can use in the manufacturing process for cost reduction varies  depending upon the complexity of the product being made  our customers demand for our products and their ability to take delivery of our products and to make timely payments for delivered products  our ability to optimize the ordering of inventory as to timing and amount to avoid holding inventory in excess of immediate production needs  our ability to offer technologically advanced  cost effective  quick response  manufacturing services  fluctuations in the availability and pricing of components  timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  cyclicality in our target markets  fluctuations in our market share  expenses and disruptions associated with acquisitions and divestitures  announcements of operating results and business conditions by our customers  announcements by our competitors relating to new customers or technological innovation or new services  economic developments in the electronics industry as a whole  credit rating and stock analyst downgrades  political and economic developments in countries in which we have operations  and general market conditions 
if our operating results in the future are below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the market price of our outstanding securities could be harmed 

table of contents if we incur more restructuring related charges than currently anticipated  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
in furtherance of the continued implementation of the series of restructuring plans which we have initiated commencing in fiscal  we expect to incur restructuring related charges of an aggregate of approximately million to million over the next few quarters  primarily to consolidate facilities and reduce our workforce in north america and europe  although no certainty can be attributed to this amount or the timing of its recognition 
we continue to evaluate our cost structure relative to our revenue levels and may take additional restructuring charges in the future 
if our estimates about future restructuring charges prove to be inadequate  our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
in addition  if we are unable to successfully move production from higher cost to lower cost facilities without experiencing degradation of quality or timeliness of our service to our customers  our business could be harmed 
we depend on limited or sole source suppliers for critical components 
the inability to obtain sufficient components as required  and under favorable purchase terms  would cause harm to our business 
we are dependent on certain suppliers  including limited and sole source suppliers  to provide key components used in our products 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  delays in component deliveries  which in turn could cause delays in product shipments and require the redesign of certain products 
in addition  if we are unable to procure necessary components under favorable purchase terms  including at favorable prices and with the order lead times needed for the efficient and profitable operation of our factories  our results of operations could suffer 
the electronics industry has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  shortages in semiconductor devices  including application specific integrated circuits  dram  sram  flash memory  certain passive devices such as tantalum capacitors  and other commodities that may be caused by such conditions as overall market demand surges or supplier production capacity constraints 
the inability to continue to obtain sufficient components as and when required  or to develop alternative sources as and when required  could cause delays  disruptions or reductions in product shipments or require product redesigns which could damage relationships with current or prospective customers  and increase inventory levels and costs  thereby causing harm to our business 
we potentially bear the risk of price increases associated with shortages in electronics components 
at various times  there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry leading to increased component prices 
one of the services that we perform for many customers is purchasing electronics components used in the manufacturing of the customers products 
as a result of this service  we potentially bear the risk of price increases for these components if we are unable to purchase components at the pricing level anticipated to support the margins assumed in our agreements with our customers 

table of contents our net sales could decline if our competitors provide comparable manufacturing services and improved products at a lower cost 
we compete with different contract manufacturers  depending on the type of service we provide or the geographic locale of our operations  in an industry which is intensely competitive 
these competitors may have greater manufacturing  financial  r d and or marketing resources than we have 
in addition  we may not be able to offer prices as low as some of our competitors because those competitors may have lower cost structures as a result of their geographic location or the services they provide  or because such competitors are willing to accept business at lower margins in order to utilize more of their excess capacity 
in that event  our net sales could decline 
we also expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products or services  to reduce their current products or service sales prices and to introduce new products or services that may offer greater value added performance and improved pricing 
any of these could cause a decline in sales  loss of market acceptance of our products or services and corresponding loss of market share  or profit margin compression 
we depend on the continuing trend of oems to outsource 
a substantial factor in our past revenue growth was attributable to the transfer of manufacturing and supply based management activities from our oem customers 
future growth is partially dependent on new outsourcing opportunities 
to the extent that these opportunities are not available  our future growth would be unfavorably impacted 
our non us locations represent a significant portion of our net sales  we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally 
approximately  and of our net sales from continuing operations came from sites outside the united states in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of our foreign sales and facilities  our operations are subject to a variety of risks and costs that are unique to international operations  including the following adverse movement of foreign currencies against the us dollar in which our results are reported  import and export duties  and value added taxes  import and export regulation changes that could erode our profit margins or restrict exports  potential restrictions on the transfer of funds  government and license requirements governing the transfer of technology and products abroad  
table of contents disruption of local labor supply and or transportation services  inflexible employee contracts in the event of business downturns  the burden and cost of compliance with import and export regulations and foreign laws  and economic and political risks in emerging or developing economies 
we have been granted tax holidays  which are effective through subject to some conditions  for our malaysian and singapore sites 
we have also been granted various tax holidays in china 
these tax holidays are effective for various terms and are subject to some conditions 
it is possible that the current tax holidays will be terminated or modified or that future tax holidays that we may seek will not be granted 
if the current tax holidays are terminated or modified  or if additional tax holidays are not granted in the future or when our current tax holidays expire  our future effective income tax rate could increase 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts intended to reduce the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on foreign currency cash  receivables  investments and payables 
the gains and losses on the foreign exchange forward contracts are intended to offset the transaction gains and losses on the foreign currency cash  receivables  investments  and payables recognized in earnings 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative purposes 
our foreign exchange forward contracts related to current assets and liabilities are generally three months or less in original maturity 
as of august   we had outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately million related to continuing operations 
the change in value of the foreign exchange forward contracts resulting from a hypothetical change in foreign exchange rates would be offset by the remeasurement of the related balance sheet items  the result of which would not be significant 
as of august   the majority of our foreign currency hedging contracts were scheduled to mature in approximately three months and there were no material deferred gains or losses 
in addition  our international operations in some instances act as a natural hedge because both operating expenses and a portion of sales are denominated in local currency 
in these instances  although an unfavorable change in the exchange rate of a foreign currency against the us dollar will result in lower sales when translated to us dollars  operating expenses will also be lower in these circumstances 
although approximately of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal were denominated in currencies other than us dollar  we do not believe our total exposure to be significant because of natural hedges 
we have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our sites 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the currency of the exposure and the functional currency of our sites could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products and services in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products and services in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices being uncompetitive in markets where business is transacted in the local currency 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
as of august  substantially all of our total portfolio was scheduled to mature in less than six months 
in addition  our investments are diversified and of relatively short maturity 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our investment portfolios 
we had approximately million of cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk as of august  the weighted average interest rate of these balances as of august  was 
the fair value of these cash equivalents and short term investments approximated the carrying value as of august  interest on long term debt instruments is payable at fixed rates 
in addition  the amount of principal to be repaid at maturity is also fixed 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we entered into interest rate swap transactions under which we pay variable rates and we receive fixed rates 
the interest swaps effectively converted billion of our long term debt with fixed interest rates into debt with variable rates of interest 
our interest rate swaps have a total notional amount of billion 
the first million of swap 
table of contents transactions relate to our billion aces and expire on november  the second million of swap transactions relate to our million senior notes and expire on february  under each of these swap transactions  we pay an interest rate equal to the month libor rate plus a fixed spread 
in exchange  we receive fixed interest rates of on the million related to the aces and on the million related to the senior notes 
on november   the original swaps related to the senior notes were settled 
this settlement resulted in cash received and a gain of approximately million  which is being amortized over the remaining life of the senior notes 
also on november   solectron entered into swaps with terms similar to the original swap transactions used to hedge the interest paid on the senior notes and designated the swaps as fair value hedges under sfas no 
we may not be able to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights 
our ability to effectively compete may be affected by our ability to protect our proprietary information 
we hold a number of patents and other license rights 
these patents and license rights may not provide meaningful protection for our manufacturing processes and equipment innovations  which could result in litigation 
any resulting litigation could be lengthy and costly and could harm our financial condition 
we could become involved in intellectual property disputes 
in the past we have been and may from time to time continue to be  notified of claims that we may be infringing patents  copyrights or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties 
in the event of an infringement claim  we may be required to spend a significant amount of money to develop a non infringing alternative  to obtain licenses  and or to defend against the claim 
we may not be successful in developing such an alternative or obtaining a license on reasonable terms  if at all 
any litigation  even where an infringement claim is without merit  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
accordingly  the resolution or adjudication of intellectual property disputes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure to comply with environmental regulations could harm our business 
as a company in the electronics manufacturing services industry  we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations  including those relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing process as well as air quality and water quality regulations  restrictions on water use  and storm water regulations 
although we have never sustained any significant loss as a result of non compliance with such regulations  any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  these laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant costs to comply with regulations 
we own and lease some contaminated sites for some of which we have been indemnified by third parties for required remediation  sites for which there is a risk of the presence of contamination  and sites with some levels of contamination for which we may be liable and which may or may not ultimately require any remediation 
we have obtained environmental insurance to reduce potential environmental liability exposures posed by some of our operations and facilities 
we believe  based on our current knowledge  that the cost of any groundwater or soil clean up that may be required at our facilities would not materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
nevertheless  the process of remediating contamination in soil and groundwater at facilities is costly and cannot be estimated with high levels of confidence  and there can be no assurance that the costs of such activities would not harm our business  financial condition and results of operations in the future 
our rating downgrades make it more expensive for us to borrow money 
on december   moody s investor s service and standard poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba and bb  respectively  with a negative outlook 
on march   standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bb with a negative outlook 
on may   moody s investors services downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to ba with a stable outlook 
on march   standard and poor s downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bb with a negative outlook 
on june   standard and poor s placed our corporate credit and other ratings on credit watch with negative implications 
on june   moody s placed our ratings under review for possible downgrade 
these rating downgrades increase our cost of capital should we borrow under our revolving lines of credit  and may make it more expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future on terms that are acceptable to us or at all  which may have other negative implications on our business  many of which are beyond our control 
failure to attract and retain key personnel and skilled associates could hurt our operations 
our continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical associates 
losing the services of key personnel could harm us 
our business also depends upon our ability to continue to attract key executives and retain senior managers and skilled associates 
failure to do so could harm our operations
