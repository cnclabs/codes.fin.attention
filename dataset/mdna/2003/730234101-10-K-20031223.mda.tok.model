net interest income 
the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
the company s net interest rate spread is impacted by changes in general market interest rates  including changes in the relation between short and long term interest rates the yield curve  and the company s interest rate sensitivity position 
while management seeks to manage its business to limit the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates  different aspects of its business nevertheless remain subject to risk from interest rate changes

the increase in average interest earning assets during fiscal was mainly attributable to the acquisition of investment securities funded by the increase in deposits 
the majority of the company s interest earning assets are comprised of adjustable rate assets 
the company s adjustable rate loans and investment securities are subject to periodic interest rate caps 
periodic caps limit the amount by which the interest rate on a particular mortgage loan or investment securities may increase at its next interest rate reset date

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
impact of new accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policy in preparing financial information  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses for the periods shown 
the accounting principles followed by the company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general banking practices 
estimates and assumptions most significant to the company are related primarily to allowance for loan losses and goodwill and are summarized in the following discussion and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has established a systematic method of periodically reviewing the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish a sufficient allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance for losses on loans is based on management s current judgments about the credit quality of individual loans and segments of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans in established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the loan portfolio  and considers all known internal and external factors that affect loan collectability as of the reporting date 
such evaluation  which include a review of all loans on which full collectability may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimate net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s knowledge of inherent risks in the portfolio that are probable and reasonably estimable and other factors that warrant recognition in providing an appropriate loan loss allowance 
the company s goodwill the amount in excess of book value of acquired institutions is reviewed at least annually to ensure that there have been no events or circumstances resulting in an impairment of the recorded amount of excess purchase price 
adverse changes in the economic environment  operations of acquired business units  or other factors could result in a decline in projected fair values 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to implied fair value 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
it is the objective of the company to minimize  to the degree prudently possible  its exposure to interest rate risk  while maintaining an acceptable interest rate spread 
interest rate spread is the difference between the company s yield on its interest earning assets and its cost of interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risk is generally understood to be the sensitivity of the company s earnings  net asset values  and stockholders equity to changes in market interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the company s earnings 
the effect on earnings of changes in interest rates generally depends on how quickly the company s yield on interest earnings assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities react to the changes in market rates of interest 
if the company s cost of deposit accounts reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the yield on the company s mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets  then an increasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings 
on the other hand  if the company s yield on its mortgage loans and other interest earnings assets reacts more quickly to changes in market interest rates than the company s cost of deposit accounts  then an increasing rate environment is likely to favorably affect the company s earnings and a decreasing interest rate environment is likely to adversely affect the company s earnings 
net portfolio value the value of the company s loan and investment portfolio will change as interest rates change 
rising interest rates will generally decrease the company s net portfolio value npv  while falling interest rates will generally increase the value of that portfolio 
the following table sets forth  quantitatively  as of september   the estimate of the projected changes in npv in the event of a   and basis point instantaneous and permanent increase and a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
due to the current low prevailing interest rate environment  the changes in npv is not estimated for a decrease in interest rates of or basis points 
change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net portfolio value ratio change in npv as a percentage of estimated market value of assets amount change change dollars in thousands computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are calculated by the ots from data provided by the company and are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan repayments and deposit runoffs  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
management cannot predict future interest rates or their effect on the company s npv in the future 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the computation of npv 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  which represent the company s primary loan product  have features that restrict changes in interest rates during the initial term and over the remaining life of the asset 
in addition  the proportion of adjustable rate loans in the company s portfolio could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity if market rates decrease 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase
