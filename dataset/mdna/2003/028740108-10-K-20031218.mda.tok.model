in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  the primary component of a gas generant used in certain automotive airbag safety systems  and halotron  a chemical used in fire extinguishing systems ranging from portable fire extinguishers to airport firefighting vehicles 
the perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron facilities are located on our property in southern utah and the chemicals produced and sold at these facilities collectively represent our specialty chemicals operating segment 
our other lines of business include our real estate segment which is winding down  and the production of environmental protection equipment  including waste water and seawater treatment systems 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we also hold a equity interest in an entity that manufactures and distributes commercial explosives 
critical accounting estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables us to provide the users of our financial statements with useful and reliable information about our operating results and financial condition 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
judgments and assessments of uncertainties are required in applying our accounting policies in many areas 
for example  key assumptions are particularly important when determining our projected liabilities for pension benefits 
information with respect to pension expenses and liabilities  together with the impact of changes in key assumptions is discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
other areas in which significant uncertainties exist include  but are not limited to  projected costs to be incurred in connection with environmental matters  tax matters  and the resolution of litigation  and the recoverability of investments in and advances to our joint venture 
a discussion of environmental and legal matters is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
information on some of the key estimates and assumptions on which our annual provision for income taxes is based may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
a discussion regarding the recoverability of investments in and advances to our joint venture is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
actual results will inevitably differ to some extent from the estimates on which our consolidated financial statements are prepared at any given point in time 
despite these inherent limitations  we believe that our management s discussion and analysis and audited consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective on our company 
sales and operating revenues 
sales of our perchlorate chemical products accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in general  demand for grade i ap is driven by a relatively small number of dod and nasa contractors 
as a result  any one individual grade i ap customer usually accounts for a significant portion of our revenues 
for example  alliant accounted for approximately  and of our revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an agreement with thiokol with respect to the supply of grade i ap through the year the agreement  as amended  provides that during its term thiokol will make all of its grade i ap purchases from us 
in addition to the grade i ap purchased from us  thiokol may use ap inventoried by it in prior years 
the agreement also establishes a pricing matrix under which grade i ap unit prices vary inversely with the quantity of grade i ap sold by us to all of our customers 
grade i ap unit prices in the matrix at all quantity levels escalate each year through fiscal and  in fiscal  are adjusted downward by approximately 
such downward adjustment will have the effect of reducing revenues and operating cash flows on grade i ap sold to thiokol by at least in fiscal after the adjustment  grade i ap unit prices again escalate each year through fiscal in connection with the acquisition  we entered into an agreement with alliant to extend an existing agreement through the year the agreement establishes prices for any grade i ap purchased by alliant from us during the term of the agreement as extended 
under this agreement  alliant agrees to use its efforts to cause our grade i ap to be qualified on all new and current programs served by alliant s bacchus works 
during  alliant acquired thiokol 
we have agreed with alliant that the individual agreements in place prior to alliant s acquisition of thiokol remain in place 
all thiokol programs existing at the time of the alliant acquisition principally the space shuttle and minuteman will continue to be priced under the thiokol agreement 
all alliant programs principally the delta  pegasus and titan will be priced under the alliant agreement 
demand for perchlorate chemicals declined throughout the s 
in  supply capacity was substantially in excess of demand levels and  in an attempt to rationalize the industry  we consummated the acquisition 
subsequent to the acquisition in  our annual sales volumes of grade i ap were approximately million  million  million  million and million pounds during the fiscal years ended september     and respectively 
prior to the tragic space shuttle columbia disaster on february   and based principally upon information we had received from our major customers  we previously estimated that annual demand for grade i ap would range between million and million pounds over the next several years 
as we have previously reported  we were not instructed to curtail production associated with the space shuttle program after the columbia disaster 
we continued to produce and deliver grade i ap in accordance with our fiscal purchase order and  as a result  our customer s inventory levels of grade i ap increased throughout the year 
assuming the space shuttle returns to flight in the fall of as to which there is no assurance  and achieves annual flight levels of between and  we are currently estimating that our annual sales volumes of grade i ap will range between and million pounds over at least the next three years 
our revenues  operating income and cash flows from operating activities will be significantly less at these lower volume levels 
in addition  demand for grade i ap is program specific and dependent upon  among other things  governmental appropriations 
we have no ability to influence the demand for grade i ap 
any decision to further delay  reduce or cancel space shuttle flights over an extended period of time would have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we also produce and sell other perchlorates 
other perchlorates have a wide range of prices per pound  depending upon the type and grade of the product 
we have recently experienced a change in the sales mix of other perchlorates  from lower price per pound products to higher price and margin per pound products 
for example  shipments of other perchlorates accounted for annual sales of between million and million during the fiscal years  and in fiscal and  shipments of other perchlorates accounted for sales of and million  respectively  although there was no substantial change in volumes 
other perchlorates are used in a variety of applications  including munitions  explosives  propellants  and initiators 
some of these applications are in a development phase  and there can be no assurance that sales of the higher price and higher margin products will continue 
a significant reduction in these sales would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
sodium azide sales accounted for approximately  and of sales during fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
autoliv  our principal sodium azide customer  accounted for approximately  and of our revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
worldwide sodium azide demand has recently declined considerably 
our sodium azide sales volumes declined approximately in both fiscal and  in fiscal  and in fiscal worldwide demand for sodium azide is substantially less than worldwide supply 
based principally upon market information received from airbag inflator manufacturers  we expect sodium azide use to continue to decline and that inflators using sodium azide will be phased out over some period of time 
sales of halotron amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
halotron is designed to replace halon based fire extinguishing systems 
accordingly  demand for halotron depends upon a number of factors including the willingness of consumers to switch from halon based systems  the effects of competing products  as well as existing and potential governmental regulations 
real estate sales amounted to approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
the nature of real estate development and sales is such that we are unable reliably to predict any pattern of future real estate sales 
in addition  real estate sales are currently estimated to be completed by the end of fiscal we do not expect to receive any cash returns in the future from our interest in our residential joint venture project  which has wound down its operations 
environmental protection equipment sales accounted for approximately  and of revenues during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
cost of sales 
the principal elements comprising our cost of sales are raw materials  electric power  labor  manufacturing overhead  depreciation and amortization and the book basis in real estate sold 
the major raw materials used in our production processes are graphite  sodium chlorate  ammonia  hydrochloric acid  sodium metal  nitrous oxide and hcfc significant increases in the cost of raw materials may have an adverse impact on margins if we are unable to pass along such increases to our customers 
during the first six months of fiscal  we received power bills from utah power that were approximately million in excess of average historical amounts 
during this period  we purchased greater quantities of certain raw materials because of these excessive power costs 
in the second half of fiscal  we recovered the excessive power costs through a settlement and curtailment arrangement with utah power 
as a result of these arrangements  our net power costs were approximately million less in fiscal compared to average historical annual amounts 
we now purchase power from utah power under the equivalent of utah electric service schedule no 
prices paid by us for raw materials have historically been relatively stable  although we have experienced cost increases on certain raw materials 
all the raw materials used in our manufacturing processes have been available in commercial quantities  although we have recently had difficulty obtaining a long term commitment for the supply of graphite 
graphite is critical to the production of our perchlorate chemicals and we are working to resolve this issue 
a substantial portion of the total cash costs of operating our specialty chemical plants  consisting mostly of labor and overhead  are largely fixed in nature 
net income 
although our net income and diluted net income per common share have not been subject to seasonal fluctuations  they have been and are expected to continue to be subject to variations from quarter to quarter and year to year due to the following factors  among others i as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we may incur material legal and other costs associated with certain litigation and contingencies  ii the magnitude  pricing and timing of perchlorate chemicals  sodium azide  halotron  and environmental protection equipment sales in the future is uncertain  iii weighted average common and common equivalent shares for purposes of calculating diluted net income per common share are subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the market price of our common stock due to outstanding warrants and options  iv the results of periodic reviews of impairment issues  and v the ability to pass on increases in raw material costs to our customers 
see liquidity and capital resources and forward looking statements risk factors below 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september sales and operating revenues 
sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this decrease was principally attributable to a decrease in specialty chemicals sales of million and a decrease in real estate sales of million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in environmental protection equipment sales of approximately million 
the decrease in specialty chemicals sales resulted principally from a decrease in shipments of sodium azide and halotron 
real estate sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due to a decrease in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal these sales are expected to decline substantially in by reason of the complete depletion of our real estate in nevada that is held for sale 
environmental protection equipment sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as of october   this segment had a backlog of approximately million 
cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales to sales was principally attributable to decreased depreciation expense associated with our specialty chemicals segment as a result of certain fully depreciated assets  and a change in the mix of products sold to higher margin products within the specialty chemicals segment 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased insurance costs and costs associated with the issue of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by decreased spending on corporate development activities 
segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of our operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals environmental protection equipment real estate total the increase in operating income in our specialty chemicals industry segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in depreciation expense associated with our specialty chemicals segment  offset partially by decreased halotron and sodium azide shipments 
the increase in the operating performance of our environmental protection equipment business was primarily due to increased sales 
the decrease in operating income of our real estate segment was principally due to decreased land sales 
net interest and other expense income 
net interest and other expense income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was principally due to the redemption of the notes 
this decrease was partially offset by our equity in the loss of es 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september sales and operating revenues 
sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal this increase was principally attributable to an increase in specialty chemicals sales of million and an increase in real estate sales of million 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in environmental protection equipment sales of approximately million 
the increase in specialty chemicals sales resulted principally from increased perchlorate shipments  offset in part by a decrease in shipments of sodium azide and halotron 
real estate sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due to an increase in land sales in fiscal compared to fiscal environmental protection equipment sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  cost of sales was in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in the percentage of cost of sales to sales was principally attributable to increased perchlorate shipments and an increase in real estate sales  which generally have a higher gross margin than our other products 
operating expenses 
operating selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million  from million in fiscal most of the increases in operating expenses relate to costs incurred in connection with corporate and product development activities 
we incurred increased costs relating to the evaluation and investigation of the potential for alternative uses and applications of certain of our existing and related products 
in addition  during the fiscal year ended september   we experienced increases in operating expenses as a result of detailed due diligence activities directly related to certain corporate development opportunities 
operating expenses during each of the fiscal years and  also include approximately million in costs associated with the investigation and evaluation of trace amounts of perchlorate chemicals found in lake mead 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
segment operating income loss 
operating income loss of our operating segments during the fiscal years ended september  and was as follows specialty chemicals environmental protection equipment real estate total the increases in operating income in our specialty chemicals industry segment was primarily attributable to an increase in perchlorate chemical shipments  offset partially by decreased halotron and sodium azide shipments  and lower power costs in fiscal see above 
the increase in operating income of our real estate segment was principally due to increased land sales 
the operating loss incurred in our environmental protection equipment business in fiscal was primarily due to decreased sales 
net interest and other expense income 
net interest and other expense income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was principally due to lower average interest rates earned on cash and cash equivalent balances 
inflation general inflation did not have a significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  general inflation may have an effect on gross profit in the future as certain of our agreements relating to grade i ap and sodium azide customers require fixed prices  although certain of such agreements contain escalation features that should somewhat insulate us from increases in costs associated with inflation 
as discussed above  we have recently experienced increases in certain raw material costs and power costs  although we believe that such increases are not specifically related to the effects of general inflation 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash balances will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations 
however  the resolution of litigation and contingencies  and the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for perchlorates  sodium azide and halotron  may have an effect on the use and availability of cash 
the combination of the lower levels of expected grade i ap sales  the price reduction on grade i ap sold to thiokol beginning in fiscal  and declining real estate sales all referred to above is expected to significantly reduce our revenues and cash flows from operating activities in fiscal as a result of these factors and absent the consideration of any changes in working capital  we currently expect that our cash flows from operating activities will be at least less in fiscal as compared to fiscal capital expenditures were million  million and million during the fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
capital expenditures relate principally to specialty chemicals segment capital improvement projects and enterprise software 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in december we made an investment of approximately million in es 
the form of our investment in es represents a combination of term and revolving debt  preferred stock and common equity 
we are currently in negotiations to modify the terms of the term and revolving debt  but do not presently expect to incur any impairment loss related to any such modifications 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we redeemed the notes on march  the total cost of the redemption  including interest on the notes  was approximately million 
we recognized a loss on the redemption of the notes of approximately million 
during the three year period ended september   we received cash of approximately million none in fiscal from our ventana canyon residential joint venture 
the venture has wound down its operations and we do not expect to receive any cash returns from this venture in the future 
during the three year period ended september   we spent million on the repurchase of our common stock 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  our dividend and stock repurchase program became effective in fiscal under the provisions of this program  on december   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share  payable on january   to shareholders of record on december  as a result of the litigation and contingencies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we have incurred legal and other costs  and we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods 
any such costs  to the extent borne by us and not recovered through insurance  would adversely affect our liquidity 
we are currently unable to predict or quantify the amount or range of such costs or the period of time over which such costs may be incurred 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following tables summarize our fiscal year contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by period total and thereafter contractual obligations operating leases pension obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration by period total amounts committed and thereafter other commitments letters of credit total other commitments forward looking statements risk factors certain matters discussed in this report may be forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the risk factors set forth below 
the following risk factors  among others  may cause our operating results and or financial position to be adversely affected from time to time a declining demand including excess customer inventories or downward pricing pressure for our products as a result of general or specific economic conditions  b governmental budget decreases affecting the dod or nasa  including the status of the space shuttle program  that would cause a decrease in demand for grade i ap  c technological advances and improvements with respect to existing or new competitive products causing a reduction or elimination of demand for grade i ap and other perchlorates  sodium azide or halotron  d the ability and desire of purchasers to change existing products or substitute other products for our products based upon perceived quality  environmental effects and pricing  and e the fact that perchlorate chemicals  sodium azide  halotron and our environmental products have limited applications and highly concentrated customer bases 
the cost and effects of legal and administrative proceedings  settlements and investigations  particularly those investigations described in note to our consolidated financial statements  as well as the costs resulting from regulatory and environmental matters that may have a negative impact on sales or costs 
our ability to profitably integrate  manage and operate new businesses and or investments competitively and cost effectively 
competitive factors including  but not limited to  our limitations respecting financial resources and our ability to compete against companies with substantially greater resources  significant excess market supply in the sodium azide market and in the perchlorate market  potential patent coverage issues  and the development or penetration of competing new products  particularly in the propulsion  airbag inflation  fire extinguishing and explosives businesses 
underutilization of our manufacturing facilities resulting in production inefficiencies and increased costs  the inability to recover facility costs  reductions in margins  and impairment issues 
the near depletion of our clark county  nevada commercial real estate  with only acres remaining for sale 
the effects of  and changes in  trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations and other activities of governments  agencies or similar organizations  including  but not limited to  environmental  safety and transportation issues 
the dependence upon a single facility for the production of most of our products 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws and series d preferred stock  and the dividend of preference stock purchase rights and related rights agreement  could have the effect of making it more difficult for potential acquirors to obtain a control position in us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
we had certain long term fixed rate debt that was redeemed on march  in december  we entered into a revolving line of credit facility that is secured by certain inventory and receivables 
to date  we have not drawn upon the line of credit 
we believe that any market risk arising from our fixed rate debt is not material 
at september   we did not have any derivative based financial instruments 
however  the amount of outstanding debt may fluctuate and we may at some time be subject to refinancing risk
