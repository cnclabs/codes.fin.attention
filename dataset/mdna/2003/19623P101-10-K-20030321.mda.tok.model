item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents the ability to provide adequate sources of funds for funding loan commitments and investment activities  as well as the ability to provide sufficient funds to cover deposit withdrawals  payment of debt and financing of operations 
converting assets to cash for these funds is primarily with proceeds from collections on loans and maturities of investment securities or by attracting and obtaining new deposits 
during  the company was successful in meeting its liquidity needs by increasing deposits percent to  from deposits of  on december  of this increase   or percent resulted from the purchase of quitman federal savings bank in also  the company met its liquidity needs by increasing other borrowed money and trust preferred securities percent to  from  on december  of this increase   or percent resulted from the quitman purchase 
should the need arise  the company also maintains relationships with the federal home loan bank and several correspondent banks that can provide funds on short notice 
liquidity is monitored on a regular basis by management 
the company s liquidity position remained satisfactory in average liquid assets cash and amounts due from banks  interest bearing deposits in other banks  funds due and securities represented percent of average deposits in as compared to percent of average deposits in average loans represented percent of average deposits in as compared to percent in average interest bearing deposits were percent of average earning assets in as compared to percent of average earning assets in the company satisfies most of its capital requirements through retained earnings 
during  retained earnings provided  of increase in equity 
additionally  equity had an increase of  resulting from the change during the quarter in unrealized gains on securities available for sale  net of taxes  an increase of  resulting from the stock grant plan  a decrease of  resulting from treasury shares acquired through the company s stock repurchase plan and an increase of  as a result of the acquisition of quitman federal savings bank

additionally  equity had an increase of  resulting from the change during the year in unrealized gains on securities available for sale  net of taxes  an increase of  resulting from the stock grant plan and a decrease of  resulting from treasury shares acquired through the company s stock repurchase plan 
thus  total equity increased by a net amount of  in as of december   the company s capital totaled approximately  and there was not any outstanding commitment for any material capital expenditures 
the company has purchased land for a third location in lee dougherty county  however  no contracts have been signed for construction of the facility at this time 
it is anticipated the project will approximate  with anticipated opening during the fourth quarter of the company has purchased land for a location in thomasville  georgia  however  it is not anticipated for any construction until part ii continued item continued liquidity and capital resources continued the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued risk based capital guidelines for u 
s 
banking organizations 
the objective of these efforts was to provide a more uniform framework that is sensitive to differences in risk assets among banking organizations 
the guidelines define a two tier capital framework 
tier capital consists of common stock and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill 
tier capital consists of certain convertible  subordinated and other qualifying term debt and the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
the company has no tier capital other than the allowance for loan losses 
using the capital requirements presently in effect  the tier ratio as of december  was percent and total tier and risk based capital was percent 
both of these measures compare favorably with the regulatory minimum of percent for tier and percent for total risk based capital 
the company s tier leverage ratio was percent as of december   which exceeds the required ratio standard of percent 
for  average capital was  representing percent of average assets for the year 
this compares to percent for in  the company paid annual dividends of per share compared to per share in the dividend payout ratio  defined as dividends per share divided by net income per share  was percent in as compared to percent in as of december   management was not aware of any recommendations by regulatory authorities which if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or results of operations 
however  it is possible that examinations by regulatory authorities in the future could precipitate additional loss charge offs that could materially impact the company s liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
results of operations the company s results of operations are determined by its ability to effectively manage interest income and expense  to minimize loan and investment losses  to generate noninterest income and to control noninterest expense 
since market forces and economic conditions beyond the control of the company determine interest rates  the ability to generate net interest income is dependent upon the company s ability to obtain an adequate spread between the rate earned on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
thus  the key performance for net interest income is the interest margin or net yield  which is taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets

the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due and other loans that management believes require attention 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to replenish the allowance for loan losses and maintain it at a level management has determined to be adequate

critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
the company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies  including judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the company s financial position and or results of operations 
the more critical accounting and reporting policies include the company s accounting for securities  loans  the allowance for loan losses and income taxes 
colony s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in detail in the colony s financial statements 
inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of financial institutions are monetary in nature and  therefore  differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
fluctuations in interest rates and actions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb to regulate the availability and cost of credit have a greater effect on a financial institution s profitability than do the effects of higher costs for goods and services

interest receivable that has been accrued in prior years and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectibility is charged to the allowance for possible loan losses 
interest on loans that are classified as nonaccrual is recognized when received 
past due loans are loans whose principal or interest is past due days or more 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms 
the following table presents  at the dates indicated  the aggregate of nonperforming loans for the categories indicated 
december  in thousands loans accounted for on a nonaccrual installment loans and term loans contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing loans  the terms of which have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the position of the borrower loans now current about which there serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present loan repayment terms during the year ended december   approximately  of loans was charged off and approximately  was recovered on charged off loans

part ii continued item continued commitments and contingencies in the ordinary course of business  the banks have entered into off balance sheet financial instruments which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees and liability for assets held in trust 
such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statements when funds are disbursed or the instruments become payable 
the banks use the same credit policies for these off balance sheet financial instruments as they do for instruments that are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
following is an analysis of the significant off balance sheet financial instruments as of december in thousands commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitment amounts expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the credit risk involved in issuing these financial instruments is essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers 
the company does not anticipate any material losses as a result of the commitments and contingent liabilities 
the nature of the business of the company is such that it ordinarily results in a certain amount of litigation 
in the opinion of management and counsel for the company and the banks  there is no litigation in which the outcome will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
part ii continued item continued summary of loan loss experience the allowance for possible loan losses is created by direct charges to operations 
losses on loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which such loans  in management s opinion  become uncollectible 
recoveries during the period are credited to this allowance 
the factors that influence management s judgment in determining the amount charged to operating expense are past loan experience  composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of possible future losses  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the company s allowance for loan losses was approximately  as of december   representing percent of year end total loans outstanding  compared with  as of december   which represented percent of year end total loans outstanding 
the allowance for loan losses is reviewed continuously based on management s evaluation of current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as well as the impact of prevailing and expected economic business conditions 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover possible loan losses on the loans outstanding 
the following table presents an analysis of the company s loan loss experience for the periods indicated

the allocation is based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for risk characteristic changes among each category 
additional reserve amounts are allocated by evaluating the loss potential of individual loans that management has considered impaired 
the reserve for loan loss allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates  and therefore is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur
