item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the results of our operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included within this report 
overview we are a leading chemistry based drug discovery and development company  focused on applications for new small molecule prescription drugs 
we engage in comprehensive chemistry research from lead discovery  optimization and development to commercial manufacturing 
we perform chemistry research for many of the leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and for our own internal research and development 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  unbilled revenue  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as part of our strategy to provide a comprehensive offering of natural product and chemical lead finding discovery services and technologies to our customers  we have acquired natural product libraries and related assets and are producing novel compound libraries and chemical screening libraries 
we have estimated the fair value of our natural product libraries obtained as part of our acquisition of new chemical entities in january and have included their value in our inventory 
we are also capitalizing the cost of internally producing our novel compound and screening libraries in our inventory 
in february  we obtained eli lilly s co 
s collection of natural product libraries including source materials  purified screening library samples  chemical analytical data and chemistry database tools 
as part of our collaboration with eli lilly we have also initiated efforts to significantly enhance our biological screening 
we expect our investment in biological screening to be operational by the end of the combination of these investments should enhance our ability to market and sell our libraries  sales of which to date have not been significant 
total chemical library and natural products related assets recorded on our balance sheet as of december  were million 
if we are unable to successfully execute our business plan  or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to write down the value of these assets  resulting in a charge to operations 
we have equity investments in companies that have operations in areas within our strategic focus 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in their current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
our intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over five to fifteen years 
we review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
a determination of impairment is made based on estimates of future cash flows 
if such assets are considered to be impaired the amount of the impairment would be based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
we perform an annual assessment of the carrying value of our goodwill for potential impairment 
a determination of impairment is made based upon the estimated future cash flows of the operations associated with goodwill 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired in the future we would be required to record a charge to our results of operations 
contract revenue our contract revenue consists primarily of fees earned under contracts with third party customers 
in general  we provide services to our customers on the following basis a full time equivalent basis that establishes the number of full time equivalents contracted for a project or a series of projects  the duration of the contract period  the fixed price per full time equivalent  plus an allowance for out of pocket expenses  which may or may not be incorporated in the full time equivalent rate  a time and materials basis under which we charge our customers based on an hourly rate plus out of pocket expenses  or to a lesser extent  a fixed price basis 
typically  our full time equivalent contracts have terms of six months or longer and our time and materials contracts have terms of one to twelve months 
fixed price contracts are entered into for much shorter periods of time  generally two to six months 
because our fixed price contracts relate to projects that are generally limited in scope and are of short duration  we have not historically experienced any material cost overruns under these contracts 
our full time equivalent contracts provide for annual adjustments in billing rates for the scientists assigned to the contract 
generally  our contracts may be terminated by the customer upon days to one year s prior notice  depending on the size of the contract 
the company recognizes revenue under full time equivalent contracts on a monthly basis as work is performed based on the terms of the contract 
time and material contract revenues are recognized based on the number of hours devoted to the project multiplied by the customer s billing rates plus the material costs incurred 
fixed fee contract revenue is recognized by the company as projects are completed and delivered 
cost of revenue consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees and other direct project related costs 
licensing fees  milestones and royalties we seek to include provisions in our contracts for our discovery services which contain licensing  milestone and royalty payments should our proprietary technology and expertise lead to the discovery of new products that reach the market 
to date  we have received substantially all of our milestone and royalty payments under these arrangements from aventis with respect to allegra 
generally  the provisions for licensing  milestone and royalty payments included in our contracts are related to the occurrence of specific identifiable events 
we will recognize revenue upon the occurrence of one of these events  such as the successful completion of a clinical trial phase or the sale of a product containing licensed technology  and the resolution of any uncertainties or contingencies regarding potential collection of the related payment 
non recurring licensing fees  milestones and royalties 
although we entered into a license agreement with aventis in  we began to recognize royalty revenue related to sales in the united states under that agreement in february this delay was due to the significant time expended for issuance of our patents and the resolution of related patent interference claims by aventis 
recurring royalties 
recurring royalties consist of royalties from aventis under a license agreement based on sales of fexofenadine hcl  marketed as allegra in the americas and telfast elsewhere 
royalty payments are due within days after each calendar quarter and are determined based on sales of allegra telfast in that quarter 
costs and expenses cost of contract revenue 
our cost of contract revenue  from which we derive gross profit from net contract revenue  consists primarily of compensation and associated fringe benefits for employees and other direct and indirect project related costs 
technology incentive award 
we maintain a technology development incentive plan designed to stimulate and encourage novel technology development by our employees 
this plan allows eligible participants to share in a percentage of the net revenue earned by us relating to patented technology with respect to which the eligible participant is named as an inventor 
under our technology development incentive plan  thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman and chief executive officer  receives payments as the sole inventor of the patents for fexofenadine hcl equal to of the total payments received by us with respect to those patents 
research and development 
research and development expense consists of payments in connection with collaborations with academic institutions  compensation and benefits for scientific personnel for work performed on proprietary research projects and costs of supplies and related chemicals as well as indirect costs 
we are funding several internal research and development programs to discover new compounds with commercial potential 
we would then seek to license these compounds to a third party in return for up front license service fees and milestone payments as well as recurring royalty payments if these compounds are successfully developed into new drugs and reach the market 
we utilize our expertise in biocatalysis  natural products and small molecule chemistry to perform our internal research and development projects 
included in our internal research and development projects is a cooperative research and development agreement with the national cancer institute to develop anti cancer compounds  as well as other projects in the oncology and immunosuppression therapeutic areas 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists of compensation and related fringe benefits for marketing and administrative employees  professional services  marketing costs and all costs related to facilities and information services 
other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income  interest expense  our equity in our unconsolidated affiliates  organichem and fluorous technologies  realized gains or losses on sales of investment securities and other non operating expenses 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue 
contract revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase was due principally to a greater number of projects under contract primarily for medicinal and chemical development services 
this increase was facilitated by an increase in the number of scientific staff to at december  from at december  we expect our contract revenue will be positively impacted by our acquisition of organichem during the first quarter of while research and development spending by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies declined during  we were able to maintain our growth during we expect the trend of cost reduction initiatives to continue in our customer base in the near term 
recurring royalties 
recurring royalties for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the increase was attributable to increased sales of fexofenadine hcl by aventis 
beginning in december schering plough began to market and sell claritin as an over the counter drug which could negatively impact future recurring royalty revenues 
total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for cost of contract revenue 
cost of contract revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for contract revenue margin was in and  primarily due to increased rates on customer contracts and leveraging the expansion of our facilities 
technology incentive award 
the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was directly attributable to the increase in recurring royalties 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase was due to an increase in internally funded research efforts utilizing drug discovery technologies acquired through the company s recent acquisitions 
also contributing to the increase was the issuance of stock purchase warrants to bristol myers squibb company bms in connection with an agreement entered with bms with a value to us of under that agreement  bms transferred to us intellectual property to us  providing us with ownership of one of bms s late stage pre clinical drug candidates  along with patent applications covering attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and central nervous system indications related both to this candidate and structural analogs 
research and development expenditures were of total revenue for the year ended december  compared to for selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in administrative and marketing staff to support the expansion of our operations  additional expenses of million related to the operations of our research center in mount prospect  illinois which was acquired in september offset by a decrease in recruitment expenses of selling  general and administrative expenses represented of contract revenue in compared to of contract revenue in included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  was million of goodwill amortization 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased amortizing goodwill effective january  accordingly  no goodwill was amortized in total other income  net 
total other income  net decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for total other income  net for  was comprised of million in interest income  net of interest expense  million in income from our unconsolidated affiliates  organichem and fluorous technologies  inc  and approximately of other non operating income 
total other income  net for was comprised of million in interest income  net of interest expense  million in income from our unconsolidated affiliates  organichem and fluorous technologies  inc  and of other non operating income 
the decrease in interest income is the result of the lower interest rate environment and the repurchase of  shares of our stock at a cost of million 
beginning in  total other income  net will not include income from organichem as a result of our acquisition of organichem in the first quarter of total other income  net from organichem was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the effective rate for our provision for income taxes was in and year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue 
contract revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase was due principally to a greater number of projects under contract primarily for medicinal and chemical development services 
this increase was facilitated by an increase in the number of scientific staff to at december  from at december  recurring royalties 
recurring royalties for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for the increase was attributable to increased sales of fexofenadine hcl by aventis 
total revenue 
total revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to million for cost of contract revenue 
cost of contract revenue increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for contract revenue margin increased to in from in  primarily due to increased rates on customer contracts and leveraging the expansion of our facilities 
technology incentive award 
the technology incentive award expense incurred under our technology development incentive plan increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was directly attributable to the increase in recurring royalties 
research and development 
research and development expense increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the increase was due primarily to an increase in internally funded research efforts 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in administrative and marketing staff to support the expansion of our operations  and an increase in expenses related to recruitment of scientists 
selling  general and administrative expenses represented of contract revenue in and total other income  net 
total other income  net increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for total other income  net for  was comprised of million in interest income  net of interest expense  million in income from our unconsolidated affiliates  organichem and fluorous technologies  inc  and approximately  of other non operating income 
total other income  net for was comprised of million in interest income  net of interest expense  in income from our unconsolidated affiliate  organichem  and  of other non operating income 
the increase in interest income is the result of increased investments resulting from the company s follow on offering in october income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the effective rate for our provision for income taxes was in and in liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  the increase of million resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in inventories of million offset by a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we have available a million credit facility to supplement our liquidity needs 
there were no borrowings under this credit facility at december  subsequent to december  we borrowed million under this line to refinance organichem s bank debt 
all of such borrowings remain outstanding 
we have historically funded our business through operating cash flows  proceeds from borrowings and the issuance of equity securities 
for the year ended december   we generated cash of million from operating activities as compared to million for the year ended december  total capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  capital expenditures in were predominantly in connection with the expansion of our facilities in albany  new york 
these expenditures were primarily financed through operating cash flows 
during  we used million for financing activities  consisting primarily of million used to purchase treasury shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program described below 
this was offset by million generated from stock option exercises and shares purchased through our employee stock purchase plan 
during  we increased cash by million from financing activities  consisting primarily of additional borrowings under long term debt of million 
during the first quarter of we completed the acquisition of organichem 
on january  we exercised our conversion option with respect to million of organichem subordinated debentures 
the conversion of the debentures into additional shares of organichem common stock increased our ownership in organichem from to 
on february   we purchased the remaining outstanding shares of organichem for million in cash 
the purchase price was funded through borrowings under our new five year million term loan which matures on february  the term loan bears interest at a variable rate 
currently million of the million bears an interest rate of and million of the million bears an interest rate of 
as a result of the organichem acquisition  we expect to record approximately million of goodwill  subject to our final valuation 
the acquisition of organichem will enable us to perform large scale manufacturing of pharmaceutical intermediates and active ingredients 
organichem s cash requirements have historically been funded by cash from operations and debt financing 
organichem s business is subject to greater volatility due to the short term nature of its contracts  and this volatility could significantly impact future results of operations and cash flows 
effective january   we will begin consolidating organichem s operating results 
this will have the impact of increasing our revenue and cost of revenue 
organichem s historically gross margins are lower than ours  which could impact our future consolidated gross margins 
we are pursuing the expansion of our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect that such activities will be funded from existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  the issuance of debt or equity securities and borrowings 
future acquisitions  if any  could be funded with cash on hand  cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility and or the issuance of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that attractive acquisition opportunities will be available to us or will be available at prices and upon such other terms that are attractive to us 
we regularly evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and product lines and may hold discussions regarding such potential acquisitions 
as a general rule  we will publicly announce such acquisitions only after a definitive agreement has been signed 
in addition  in order to meet our long term liquidity needs or consummate future acquisitions  we may incur additional indebtedness or issue additional equity or debt securities  subject to market and other conditions 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the failure to raise the funds necessary to finance our future cash requirements or consummate future acquisitions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our strategy and could negatively affect our operations in future periods 
during  we repurchased  shares of our own stock 
from time to time we may repurchase additional shares under our second stock repurchase program which was approved by our board of directors during the fourth quarter of this second program allows us to repurchase up to an additional million of our shares over a twelve month period 
through march  we had repurchased shares of our stock under this stock repurchase program at a cost of million  leaving milion in repurchases available under the second repurchase program

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  use of the pooling of interests method is prohibited 
goodwill will initially be recognized as an asset and measured as the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
intangible assets other than goodwill will be recognized as an asset apart from goodwill if that asset arises from contractual or other legal rights 
the statement will apply to all business combinations initiated or completed after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill including goodwill reported on the separate gaap financial statements of a subsidiary will not be amortized but will be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
goodwill will be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill with an impairment loss recorded for excess goodwill  if any 
intangible assets will be amortized over their estimated useful lives and will be tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life will not be amortized until its life is determined to be no longer indefinite 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in reduced amortization expense of approximately million in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we believe the adoption of sfas no 
statement will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in august  the fasb also issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb no 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb  and technical corrections as of april  this statement rescinds previously issued pronouncements relating to reporting gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to satisfy sinking fund requirements  and accounting for intangible assets of motor carriers  amends the pronouncement on accounting for leases  and also amends various other pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we do not believe that this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
previous accounting guidance was provided by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
statement replaces issue and is effective for all exit activities after december  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
it also incorporates without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas introduces two additional methods of transition for those companies that adopt sfas s provisions for fair value recognition 
the first method  the modified prospective approach  would allow us to prospectively apply the provisions of sfas to all new awards and to the unvested portions of awards that have been granted since the effective date of sfas the second method  the limited retrospective approach  is the same as the modified prospective approach except that all prior period financial statements would be restated as if sfas had been adopted for recognition purposes as of its effective date 
we can elect not to apply these two additional methods and continue our fair value recognition under the provisions of sfas sfas requires the disclosures required in annual statements under sfas to be included in interim financial statements 
the guidance and provisions for interim and annual disclosures under sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue using the provisions for fair value recognition in apb we have included the required disclosures under sfas in its financial statements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin provides guidance that determines conditions as to whether consolidation of a variable interest entity is required 
the requirements of fin are applicable to preexisting entities as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  transition disclosure requirements of fin are required in all financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after february  we do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors and certain factors affecting forward looking statements the following factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information in this form k 
except as mentioned under quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and except for the historical information contained herein  the discussion contained in this form k contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the exchange act  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in this form k 
important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere herein 
we may not be able to recruit and retain the highly skilled employees we need 
our future growth and profitability depends upon the research and efforts of our highly skilled employees  such as our scientists  and their ability to keep pace with changes in drug discovery and development technologies 
we believe that there is a shortage of scientists  and we compete vigorously with pharmaceutical firms  biotechnology firms  contract research firms  and academic and research institutions to recruit scientists 
if we cannot recruit and retain scientists and other highly skilled employees  we will not be able to continue our existing services and will not be able to expand the services we offer to our customers 
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may discontinue or decrease their usage of our services 
we depend on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that use our services for a large portion of our revenues 
although there has been a trend among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource drug research and development functions  this trend may not continue 
we have experienced increasing pressure on the part of our customers to reduce expenses  including the use of our services as a result of negative economic trends generally and in the pharmaceutical industry 
while we have continued to increase our contract revenues despite this environment we may not be able to continue this trend should these economic conditions intensify or worsen 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies discontinue or decrease their usage of our services  including as a result of the slowdown in the overall united states economy  our revenues and earnings could be lower than we expect and our revenues may decrease or not grow at historical rates 
we may lose one or more of our major customers 
during the year ended december   we earned approximately of our contract revenues providing services to three major customers 
our customers typically may cancel their contracts with days to one year s prior notice depending on the size of the contract  for a variety of reasons  many of which are beyond our control 
if any one of our major customers cancels its contract with us  our contract revenues may decrease 
the royalties we earn on allegra may decrease 
we have been issued several patents on a pure form of  and a manufacturing process for  fexofenadine hcl 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical  medical and biotechnology firms can be uncertain and can involve complex legal and factual questions 
litigation  in particular patent litigation  can be complex and time consuming and the outcome is inherently uncertain 
we cannot assure investors that aventis will ultimately succeed in its current or any future litigation against generic drug manufacturers involving patents with respect to allegra 
in the event that one or more of the patents owned by us or aventis are ultimately determined to be invalid or unenforceable  aventis and we would lose exclusivity with respect to the claims covered by those patents 
any such loss of exclusivity and the contemporaneous introduction of generic forms of fexofenadine hcl may cause a reduction in allegra sales 
in addition  under our current arrangements with aventis  aventis  with consultation from us  will take the lead with respect to preparing and executing a strategy to defend and enforce certain of the patents relating to allegra 
as a result  we may not be able to control the conduct of such litigation and the strategic decisions that are made during the course of such litigation 
on may   an fda advisory panel recommended that the prescription allergy drugs claritin  allegra and zyrtec are safe enough to be made available over the counter 
the panel had been assembled as a result of a petition by blue cross of california now wellpoint health networks requesting that the three top selling prescription antihistamines be changed to otc status 
the fda panel s only consideration was whether claritin  allegra and zyrtec have the safety profile for over the counter use without a learned intermediary 
the panel s recommendation remains under consideration by the full fda 
the fda s reaction to its advisory panel s recommendation with regard to the safety of allegra is uncertain 
in november  schering plough received approval by the fda to voluntarily switch the status of claritin from prescription to otc status 
in december  schering plough began to market and sell claritin as an otc drug 
royalties from sales of allegra currently constitute a significant portion of our total revenues and operating income 
during the year ended december   our royalties from allegra were million  which represented approximately of our total revenues 
for the year ended december   our royalties from allegra were million  which represented approximately of our total revenues 
due to the claritin otc switch  the potential for generic competition and the possibility that the fda requires allegra or zyrtec to be sold in an over the counter form  there may be an adverse effect on allegra s reimbursement status by third party payers and on the price at which it can be sold 
any such price reduction may not be adequately offset by increased volume of sales 
if the dollar amount of allegra sales subject to our license agreement decreases  due to these or any other factors  our revenues from our license agreement with aventis will also decrease 
because we have very few costs associated with the allegra license  a decrease in revenues from our license agreement for allegra would have a disproportionately adverse effect on our results of operation 
we may be unsuccessful in producing and licensing proprietary technology developed from our internal research and development efforts or acquired from a third party 
we have expended and continue to expend time and money on internal research and development with the intention of producing proprietary technologies in order to patent and then license them to other companies 
however  we may not be successful in producing any valuable technology or successful in licensing it to a third party 
to the extent we are unable to produce technology that we can license  we may not receive any revenues related to our internal research and development efforts 
we may be unsuccessful in selling or licensing the chemical and natural product libraries currently in our inventory 
as of december  the total cost of our chemical and natural product libraries included in our inventory is million 
although  we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required in the future 
we may lose valuable intellectual property if we are unable to protect it 
some of our most valuable assets include patents and trade secrets 
part of our business is developing technologies that we patent and then license to other companies 
however  some technologies that we develop may already be patented by other companies 
for this and other reasons  we may not be able to obtain patents for each new technology that we develop 
even if we are able to obtain patents  the patents may not sufficiently protect our interest in the technology 
similarly  we may not be able to protect our trade secrets by keeping them confidential 
additionally  protecting our patents and trade secrets may be costly and time consuming 
to the extent we are unable to protect intellectual property  our investment in those technologies may not yield the benefits we expected 
in addition  we may be subject to claims that we are infringing on the intellectual property of others 
we could incur significant costs defending such claims 
if we are unsuccessful in defending these claims  we may be subject to liability for infringement 
we may not be able to license technologies that we need to conduct our business 
in addition to the technologies that we develop  we also rely on technologies that we license from other companies 
we may not be able to license technologies that we need in the future or we may be unable to license such technologies on a commercially reasonable basis 
our inability to license the technologies we need could result in increased costs and  therefore  reduced profits  or the inability to engage in certain activities that require those technologies 
our failure to manage our expansion may adversely affect us 
our business has expanded rapidly in the past several years 
expansion places increased stress on our financial  managerial and human resources 
as we expand  we will need to recruit and retain additional highly skilled scientists and technicians 
expansion of our facilities may lead to increased expenses and may divert management attention away from operations 
future acquisitions may disrupt our business and distract our management 
we have engaged in a number of acquisitions and strategic investments  and we expect to continue to do so 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates  and if we do identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make such acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms or at all 
if we acquire another company  we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired business into our existing business in a timely and non disruptive manner or at all 
we may have to devote a significant amount of time and resources to do so 
even with this investment of time and resources  an acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipate 
if we fail to integrate the acquired business effectively or if key employees of that business leave  the anticipated benefits of the acquisition would be jeopardized 
the time  capital  management and other resources spent on an acquisition that fails to meet our expectations could cause our business and financial condition to be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  acquisitions can involve non recurring charges and amortization of significant amounts of goodwill that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may not be able to realize the benefits of recent acquisitions and strategic investments 
we acquired enzymed  inc  a provider of combinatorial biocatalysis discovery services  in october  american advanced organics  inc  a contract manufacturer of novel compounds  pharmaceutical intermediates and test drug substances  in february  new chemical entities  a chemistry based drug discovery company  in january  and great lakes chemical company s research and development facility outside of chicago  illinois in september we made a strategic investment in organichem corporation in december to facilitate a management buyout of a chemical manufacturing facility from nycomed amersham  plc and completed the full acquisition of organichem in february these transactions may not be as beneficial to us as we expect 
we also have an investment in fluorous technologies  inc fluorous technologies is a development stage company and may not be able to successfully develop technology and products 
we may lose one or more of our key employees 
our business is highly dependent on our senior management and scientific staff  including dr 
thomas e 
d ambra  our chairman  chief executive officer and president  david p 
waldek  our chief financial officer and treasurer  dr 
lawrence d 
jones  our senior vice president  business development  and james j 
grates  our vice president  operations 
although we have employment agreements with the individuals listed above  we do not have employment agreements with all of our key employees 
additionally  the loss of any of our other key employees  including our scientists  may have an adverse effect on our business 
the royalties we earn on allegra will likely be affected by the seasonal nature of allergies 
allergic reactions to plants  pollens and other airborne allergens generally occur during the spring and summer seasons 
therefore  we expect the demand for allegra to be lower during other times of the year 
because allegra sales change seasonally based on the demand for allergy medicines  our quarter to quarter revenues will likely experience fluctuations 
we face increased competition 
we compete directly with the in house research departments of pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as combinatorial chemistry companies  contract research companies  and research and academic institutions 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have 
as new companies enter the market and as more advanced technologies become available  we expect to face increased competition 
in the future  any one of our competitors may develop technological advances that render the services that we provide obsolete 
while we plan to develop technologies  which will give us competitive advantages  our competitors plan to do the same 
we may not be able to develop the technologies we need to successfully compete in the future  and our competitors may be able to develop such technologies before we do 
consequently  we may not be able to successfully compete in the future 
we may be held liable for harm caused by drugs that we develop and test 
we develop  test and  to a limited extent  manufacture drugs that are used by humans 
if any of the drugs that we develop  test or manufacture harms people  we may be required to pay damages to those persons 
although we carry liability insurance  we may be required to pay damages in excess of the amounts of our insurance coverage 
damages awarded in a product liability action could be substantial and could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use 
our research and development processes involve the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulation governing the use  manufacture  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
we may also incur expenses relating to compliance with environmental laws 
such expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
if we fail to meet strict regulatory requirements  we could be required to pay fines or even close our facilities 
all facilities and manufacturing techniques used to manufacture drugs in the united states must conform to standards that are established by the federal food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda conducts scheduled periodic inspections of our facilities to monitor our compliance with regulatory standards 
if the fda finds that we fail to comply with the appropriate regulatory standards  it may impose fines on us or  if the fda determines that our non compliance is severe  it may close our facilities 
any adverse action by the fda would have a negative impact on our operations 
our operations may be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster or other catastrophic event at our primary facilities 
we depend on our laboratories and equipment for the continued operation of our business 
our research and development operations and all administrative functions are primarily conducted at our facilities in albany and rensselaer  new york 
although we have contingency plans in effect for natural disasters or other catastrophic events  catastrophic events could still disrupt our operations 
even though we carry business interruption insurance policies  we may suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our insurance policies 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event in the albany area or in our facilities could have a significant negative impact on our operations 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may seriously harm our business 
terrorist attacks or acts of war may cause damage or disruption to our company  our employees  our facilities and our customers  which could significantly impact our revenues  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the long term effects on our company of the september  attacks are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks  and other acts of war  including the current war in iraq  or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
health care reform could reduce the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for drugs they sell which  in turn  could reduce the amounts that they have available to retain our services 
we depend on contracts with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for a majority of our revenues 
we therefore depend upon the ability of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to earn enough profit on the drugs they market to devote substantial resources to the research and development of new drugs 
future legislation may limit the prices pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can charge for the drugs they market 
such laws may have the effect of reducing the resources that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can devote to the research and development of new drugs 
if pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies decrease the resources they devote to the research and development of new drugs  the amount of services that we perform  and therefore our revenues  could be reduced 
the ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited  which may not be in your best interests 
there are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws which may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us  even if some of our stockholders might consider the proposal to be in their best interests 
these provisions include the following our certificate of incorporation provides for three classes of directors with the term of office of one class expiring each year  commonly referred to as a staggered board 
by preventing stockholders from voting on the election of more than one class of directors at any annual meeting of stockholders  this provision may have the effect of keeping the current members of our board of directors in control for a longer period of time than stockholders may desire 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights of any preferred stock issued  which would allow the board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or change in control 
additionally  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which  in general  imposes restrictions upon acquirers of or more of our stock 
we have adopted a shareholder rights plan  the purpose of which is  among other things  to enhance the board s ability to protect shareholder interests and to ensure that shareholders receive fair treatment in the event any coercive takeover attempt of us is made in the future 
under the terms of the shareholder rights plan  the board can in effect prevent a person or group from acquiring more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
once a shareholder acquires more than of our outstanding common stock without board approval the acquiring person  all other shareholders will have the right to purchase securities from us at a price less than their then fair market value 
these subsequent purchases by other shareholders substantially reduce the value and influence of the shares of common stock owned by the acquiring person 
our officers and directors will have significant control over us and their interests may differ from yours 
at march   our directors and officers beneficially owned or controlled approximately of our common stock 
individually and in the aggregate  these stockholders significantly influence our management  affairs and all matters requiring stockholder approval 
in particular  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition of us and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
because our stock price may be volatile  our stock price could experience substantial declines 
the market price of our common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility 
our quarterly operating results  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets and other developments affecting us or our competitors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
in addition  during the past twelve months  the stock market  and in particular technology companies  have experienced significant decreases in market value 
in addition  the global economic and potential uncertainty  including as a result of the war in iraq and the international controversy that accompanied it  have created significant additional volatility in the united states capital markets 
this volatility and the recent market decline has affected the market prices of securities issued by many companies  often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance or their business prospects  and may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
because we do not intend to pay dividends  you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings  if any  to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  the success of your investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash in interest bearing investment grade securities that we hold for the duration of the term of the respective instrument 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the investment grade securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments
