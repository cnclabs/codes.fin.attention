table of contents overview we are a provider of high quality outsourced customer relationship management crm services  offering customer interaction solutions that permit our clients to more effectively manage their relationships with their customers 
at september   we operated over  workstations in our network of customer interaction centers in the united states and canada  including workstations in our quality control center and workstations which are managed by a third party in india 
we have developed strategic relationships with market leaders in the telecommunications  financial services  insurance  technology  and logistics industries 
our client base includes aegon  at t  chase  citibank  mci  microsoft  nextel  ups and others 
we distinguish ourselves through our vertical industry expertise  well trained workforce and integrated customized technology solutions designed to meet the rigorous demands of our clients 
we have established a strong track record of consistent growth with revenues growing at a compound annual growth rate of over from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we depend on several large clients for a significant portion of our net revenues 
one client  mci  accounted for of our net revenues in fiscal in addition  three clients each accounted for over of our net revenues in fiscal aegon  nextel communications  and microsoft 
in fiscal  no client accounted for more than of our net revenues and three clients  aegon  mci and microsoft  each accounted for over of our net revenues 
most of our clients are not contractually obligated to continue to use our services at historic levels or at all 
if any of these clients were to significantly reduce the amount of services we perform for them  fail to pay us  or were to terminate the relationship altogether  our revenues and business would be harmed 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the telecommunications industry  including local  long distance and wireless telecommunications companies 
while we believe the demand for crm services within the telecommunications industry will continue to increase  the telecommunications industry is currently facing tremendous competitive pressures that have resulted in deterioration in the financial position and results of operations of certain companies within this sector 
we received and of our net revenues in and  respectively  from services provided to our telecommunications clients 
we provide inbound and outbound crm services to mci under several agreements that last through november mci accounted for  and of our revenues for  and  respectively 
on july   worldcom announced that it had filed for voluntary relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
while we have continued to provide services to mci  these events create uncertainty about our future business relationship with mci  which  if not resolved in a manner favorable to us  could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
we recorded a  charge for mci related assets during the third quarter of fiscal  of which  is included in selling  general and administrative expense and  is a reduction in revenues  in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
included in the  charge was a full reserve on a  loan to a client that derives all of its revenues from mci  as further discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have adequately reserved for all exposure created as a result of the worldcom bankruptcy  however  there can be no assurance that additional charges will not be required in the future 
at september   we had  in accounts receivable from mci  of which  were for services provided prior to the date of the worldcom bankruptcy filing and  were for services provided subsequent to the bankruptcy filing 
six of our customer interaction centers provide all or a significant portion of their services to mci 
while we do not presently believe the property and equipment at these customer interaction centers is impaired  a significant decline in the level of services being provided to mci as a result of the worldcom bankruptcy filing could result in substantial operating costs being incurred with no related revenues and a significant charge associated with property and equipment impairment 
the carrying value of property and equipment at the six customer interaction centers at september  was  future operating lease commitments for the six customer interaction centers was  at september  following an evaluation of amounts due from branddirect marketing  inc branddirect   of bad debt expense was recorded during the three months ended june  to write off amounts due from branddirect and service levels were reduced such that services were being provided on a cash basis 
branddirect represented  and of our net revenues in  and  respectively 
on may   provell  inc provell filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
a charge of  was recorded in the second quarter of to write off amounts due from provell 
provell represented and of our net revenues in and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recorded a  restructuring charge in connection with a plan designed to reduce our cost structure by closing six sites  resulting in the abandonment of fixed assets and a reduction in workforce 
no severance was paid to employees in connection with this restructuring 
in the fourth quarter of  the restructuring charge was adjusted by  since alternative uses were found for certain assets that were previously written off 
the restructuring plan was completed in the restructuring costs include site closure costs  which are the estimated costs for closing the customer interaction centers  including obligations under signed real estate lease agreements and the write off of leasehold improvements and certain 
table of contents fixed asset balances 
at september   an accrual of  remains in accrued expenses on our consolidated balance sheets  related primarily to obligations under signed real estate lease agreements 
an  restructuring charge was recorded in the quarter ended december  related to call center closures 
in the quarter ended december   the termination of a customer interaction center lease was settled for  less than the balance of the lease payments that had been accrued in the quarter ended december   resulting in the reversal of the remaining accrual 
in  we also incurred severance costs of  in connection with a workforce reduction and other employee terminations at our corporate offices that are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
at september    remained in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for future severance payments 
severance was awarded to employees during and had been fully paid to all but three employees as of september  critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances  we apply our accounting policies as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the policies discussed below to be critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from crm services under hourly and performance based models hourly revenue is recognized based on the billable hours of each crm representative as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable hour charged is based on a predetermined contractual rate  as agreed in the underlying contract 
the contractual rate can fluctuate based on certain pre determined objective performance criteria related to quality and performance 
the impact of the performance criteria on the rate per billable hour is continually updated as revenue is recognized 
some clients are contractually entitled to penalties when we are out of compliance with certain obligations as defined in the client contract 
penalties are recorded as a reduction to revenues as expected or incurred based on a measurement of our obligation under the terms of the client contract 
performance based under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our customers based on achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual performance against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
we assess the likelihood of collection based on a number of factors including a client s collection history and credit worthiness 
if the collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured 
we make estimates of potential future charges against current period revenue 
management analyzes historical sales dilution when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales allowances  which is a component of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debt  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenues 
the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on accounting for certain sales incentives eitf 
eitf requires that when recognized  the reduction in or refund of the selling price of a product or service resulting from certain sales incentives should be classified as a reduction in revenues 
we adopted eitf  as codified by eitf no 
 on october  amortization of capitalized costs for and has been reclassified to conform to the current presentation as required 
in connection with the provision of inbound and outbound crm services to its customers  we incur costs to train our crm representatives 
training programs relate to both program start up training in connection with new crm programs startup training and attrition related training for existing crm programs attrition training 
we may bill some of our customers for the costs incurred under these training programs based on the terms in the contract 
the training revenue is integral to crm revenues being generated over the course of a contract and cannot be separated as a discrete earning process under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
as a result  all training revenues are deferred 
startup training revenues are amortized over the greater of the term of the contract or one year 
attrition training revenues are amortized over the average employment of a telephone service representative 
direct costs associated with providing startup training and attrition 
table of contents training  which consist exclusively of salary and benefit costs  are also deferred and amortized over a time period consistent with the deferred training revenues 
accounting for income taxes we record estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards

we have no off balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we were obligated to make based on agreements in place as of september  amounts in thousands 
total thereafter minimum lease payments under capital leases operating leases revolving credit facility total in october we issued a letter of credit in favor of the landlord of one our canadian customer interaction centers for  canadian dollars approximately  and  us dollars at september  and  respectively as security for rents payable 
under the terms of the lease agreement  we were required to keep a  canadian dollar letter of credit in place through october   at which point it declined to  canadian dollars 
the amount required declines by  canadian dollars each year through october  the lease terminates in january results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september net revenues net revenues increased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was the result of the following increased billable hours to our top five customers increased billable hours to our logistics customer decline in business with provell  inc decline in business with branddirect marketing  inc decline in business with a telecommunications client other  net the primary driver for the increase in our net revenues was a increase in billable hours 
while our rate per billable hour increased slightly from to  this was offset by the deferral of training revenues see discussion under critical accounting policies 
the decline in business volume with provell  inc is due to its may  bankruptcy filing 
we stopped providing services to branddirect marketing  inc during fiscal due to the continued deterioration of its financial condition 
we no longer provide services to the former telecommunications client referenced above due to the termination of its outbound telemarketing campaigns 
cost of services cost of services increased  or to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase is primarily the result of the increased direct labor and telecommunications costs to support our increased net revenues

liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flow from operations  borrowings under our credit and lease facilities and proceeds from sales of securities in the capital markets 
on september   we entered into a three year   revolving credit facility the revolver with foothill capital corporation foothill  a wholly owned subsidiary of wells fargo company 
we perform services for wells fargo company  which amounted to less than of consolidated net revenues for fiscal proceeds from the revolver were used to pay down our credit facility with pnc bank  national association pnc 
the outstanding balance under the revolver at september  was  the revolver is subject to a borrowing base calculation as defined based on a percentage of eligible accounts receivable as defined 
foothill has been granted a continuing security interest in substantially all of our assets 
the revolver contains certain restrictive covenants including a minimum ebitda requirement as defined and places limits on the amount of capital expenditures that can be made by us excluding capital leases 
we were in compliance with all covenants except for those requiring audited financial statements and a debt compliance letter within days of our fiscal year ended september  we have received a waiver from foothill for these covenant violations

where ebitda for the immediately preceding fiscal year exceeds  we have the option to have interest on all or a portion of the advances under the revolver charged at a rate of interest equal to libor plus basis points 
we were not eligible for this option based on our operating results 
due to foothill s ability to suspend advances under the revolver in the event of a material adverse change as defined  the  outstanding under the revolver at september  has been classified as a current liability 
we had a working capital deficit of  at september  and  in borrowing capacity under the revolver based on our borrowing base at september  based on our projected borrowing capacity under the revolver during fiscal and our budgeted operating cash flow  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to fund our working capital deficit and fund our operations for the next year 

table of contents net cash provided by operating activities was  in fiscal compared to a use of cash of  in fiscal the improvement in operating cash flow was primarily due to a reduction in growth of our accounts receivable balances in fiscal when compared to fiscal of  and reductions in other current assets 
our net cash used in investing activities was  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  consisting almost entirely of capital expenditures 
growth of our crm operations will continue to require significant capital expenditures 
we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately  we used  for financing activities in fiscal whereas in fiscal financing activities provided cash of  the change was primarily due to a decline in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and warrants of  the repayment of a  note to a related party in fiscal  and an increase in our capital lease principal payments of  recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of other fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
this guidance does not apply to certain guarantee contracts  such as those issued by insurance companies or for a lessee s residual value guarantee embedded in a capital lease 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations would not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   or the first quarter of our fiscal we have not yet determined the potential effects of the adoption of fin on our financial statements

at our current borrowing level under the revolver  a change in the interest rate will have an effect of  on our interest expense on an annual basis 
our obligations under capital leases represent fixed rate indebtedness with rates ranging from to 
we had  in long term capital lease obligations outstanding at september  while changes in prevailing interest rates will not impact the amounts of expense we record  we are at risk with respect to future declines in rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuation relating to our canadian subsidiary  rmh teleservices international inc rmh international 
in order to hedge our cash flow economic exposure in canada  in november we entered into a collar arrangement with a commercial bank for a series of puts and calls for a fixed amount of canadian collars the collar 
under this arrangement we had the option to purchase a fixed amount of canadian dollars at a fixed rate in two week intervals covering weeks in the event the exchange rate drops below a set minimum or floor rate 
conversely  we were required to sell the same amount of canadian dollars to the bank if the exchange rate were to increase above a set maximum or ceiling rate 
as a result of this arrangement  our foreign currency risk for the fixed amount outside the collar was eliminated 
we designated the collar as a cash flow hedge and recorded it at its estimated fair value 
changes in the time value component of the collar have been excluded from the measurement of hedge effectiveness and are reported directly in earnings 
the fair value of the collar at september  was  and is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
