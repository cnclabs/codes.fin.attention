item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s most significant component of revenue  which accounted for of revenue in fiscal  was generated through its air cargo subsidiaries  mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc 
csa 
mac and csa are short haul express air freight carriers 
mac and csa s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
under the terms of the dry lease service agreements  which currently cover approximately of the revenue aircraft operated  the company passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
separate agreements cover the three types of aircraft operated by mac and csa cessna caravan  fokker f  and short brothers sd cessna caravan and fokker f aircraft a total of aircraft at march  are owned by and dry leased from federal express corporation customer  and short brothers sd aircraft two aircraft at march  are owned by the company and operated periodically under wet lease arrangements with the customer 
pursuant to such agreements  the customer determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
agreements are renewable annually and may be terminated by the customer at any time upon to days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with the customer are standard within the air freight contract delivery service industry 
the company is not contractually precluded from providing such services to other firms  and has done so in the past 
loss of its contracts with the customer would have a material adverse effect on the company 
global manufactures  services and supports aircraft deicers and ground support equipment on a worldwide basis 
global s revenue contributed approximately  and  to the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues in was primarily due to decreased commercial and military equipment orders and the april completion of a large scale airport deicer system contract 
during fiscal  the company decided to dispose of its aircraft component parts brokerage and repair services operation and accordingly  the company s financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the results of mas as a discontinued operation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the company s continuing operations operate in two business segments  providing overnight air cargo services to the air express delivery services and aviation ground support equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines and airports 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the subsidiaries have been combined into the following reportable segments air cargo and ground equipment in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the changes and trends in the company s operating expenses for continuing operations as a percentage of revenue fiscal year ended march  operating revenue in thousands 
   expense as a percentage of revenue flight operations maintenance ground equipment general and administrative depreciation and amortization 
total costs and expenses critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions 
the company s estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from estimates 
the most significant estimates made by management include allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuation  retirement benefit obligations  valuation of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method and valuation of long lived assets associated with the mas operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  company management agreed to a plan to sell mas assets and to discontinue the operations of the company s aviation service sector business 
following is a discussion of critical accounting policies and related management estimates and assumptions necessary in determining the value of related assets or liabilities 
a full description of all significant accounting policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on management s estimates of the collectability of accounts receivable 
the required allowance is determined using information such as customer credit history  industry information  credit reports and customer financial condition 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the aviation industry  customer credit issues or general economic conditions 
inventories 
the company s parts inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
provisions for excess and obsolete inventories are based on assessment of slow moving and obsolete inventories 
historical part usage  estimated future demand and anticipated transactions between willing buyers and sellers provide the basis for estimates 
estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced equipment utilization  the retirement of aircraft or ground equipment and changes in the aviation industry 
deferred taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities net of valuation allowance  if any  reflect the likelihood of the recoverability of these assets 
company judgement of the recoverability of these assets is based primarily on estimates of current and expected future earnings and tax planning 
retirement benefits obligation 
the company currently determines the value of retirement benefits assets and liabilities on an actuarial basis using a discount rate 
values are affected by our outside actuary s estimates of the expected return on insurance policies and the discount rates used 
changes in the discount rate used will affect the amount of pension gain or loss recognized in other comprehensive income 
revenue recognition 
cargo revenue is recognized upon completion of contract terms and maintenance revenue is recognized when the service has been performed 
revenue from product sales is recognized when contract terms are completed and title has passed to customers 
revenues from overhaul contracts on customer owned parts  certain labor service contracts and long term fixed price manufacturing projects are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
revenues for contracts under percentage of completion are measured by the percentage of cost incurred to date  to estimated total cost for each contract or workorder  unanticipated changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets on april  the company assesses long lived assets used in operations for impairment when events and circumstances indicate the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount 
in the event it is determined that the carrying values of long lived assets are in excess of the fair value of those assets  the company then will write down the value of the assets to fair value 
the company has applied the discontinued operations provisions of sfas no 
for the mas operations and has reflected the long lived assets associated with the mas subsidiary at management s best estimate of their fair value at march  seasonality global s business has historically been highly seasonal 
due to the nature of its product line  the bulk of global s revenues and earnings have typically occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters in anticipation of the winter season  and comparatively little has occurred during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce global s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
in june  global was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and in january and march global received additional large scale  non seasonal  contracts which the company believes contributed to management s plan to reduce seasonal fluctuation in revenues during fiscal  and however  as these contracts are completed  seasonal trends for global s business may resume 
the remainder of the company s business is not materially seasonal 
results of continuing operations as discussed above  the operations of mas have been reclassed as discontinued operations and  therefore  are not included in the results of continuing operations discussed below 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue from continuing operations decreased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in revenue primarily resulted from a decrease in global revenue of  to  partially offset by a  increase in air cargo revenue to  in fiscal the business of global has been adversely affected by reduced orders from commercial airlines and aviation related companies  due principally to the continued severe downturn in the commercial aviation industry  which started in early and significantly increased after september  although this business also derives a significant portion of its revenue from sale of products for military applications  certain military programs that use the company s products have not been fully funded to date and the company is uncertain as to the timing of such funding or the final decision to use company products 
operating expenses from continuing operations decreased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the net decrease in operating expenses consisted of the following changes cost of flight operations decreased  as a result of decreases in personnel cost and costs associated with pilot travel partially offset by increases in fuel and landing fees  maintenance expenses increased  primarily as a result of increases associated with contract service costs  partially offset by decreases in contract services related to the operations of mac  ground equipment costs decreased   as a result of decreased sales at global  depreciation and amortization increased  as a result of purchases of certain assets  general and administrative expense decrease of  primarily as a result of decreased profit sharing expense  staffing  contract labor  rent and related facilities cost  partially offset by increases in professional fees 
on a continuing operations segment basis  the most significant impacts on the company s operating results comparing the fiscal year ended march  to the prior period resulted from changes in the ground equipment operation at global 
in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  compared to prior period income of  several factors contributed to the changes in global s operating results 
global s current fiscal year operating income decreased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to completion of a large scale airport contract  lower sales volume on its us air force contract and declines in commercial equipment orders 
operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   an increase of from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase primarily resulted from increased levels of aircraft maintenance revenue 
non operating expense decreased a net  due to decreased current year interest expense related to decreased borrowing on the company s line of credit  partially offset by an other than temporary impairment charge on marketable securities 
provision for income taxes decreased  primarily due to decreased earnings at global 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended march   and were different from the federal statutory rates due to state tax provisions and a reduction in the company s excise tax accrual due to a favorable tax ruling

on a segment basis  the most significant impacts on the company s operating results comparing the fiscal year ended march  to the prior period resulted from changes in the ground equipment operation at global 
in the fiscal year ended march   global had operating income of  compared to prior period income of  several factors contributed to the changes in global s operating results 
global s fiscal year operating income increased compared to its prior fiscal year primarily due to commencement of a large scale airport contract and higher sales volume on its us air force contract offsetting declines in commercial equipment orders 
operating income for the company s overnight air cargo operations was  in the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease resulted from decreased levels of aircraft maintenance 
non operating expense decreased a net  due to decreased interest expense related in fiscal to decreased borrowing on the company s line of credit 
provision for income taxes increased  due to changes in the effective tax rate 
the provision for income taxes for the fiscal years ended march   and were different from the federal statutory rates due to state tax provisions and a reduction in the company s excise tax accrual due to a favorable tax ruling 
liquidity and capital resources as of march  the company s working capital amounted to  a decrease of  compared to march  the net decrease primarily resulted from decreased inventory  partially offset by an increase in assets held for sale 
on august  the company amended its bank financing line to a  credit facility 
under the terms of the agreement  the  secured long term revolving credit line expires on august  the credit facility contains customary events of default  a subjective clause and restrictive covenants that  among other matters  require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of march   the company was in compliance with all of the restrictive covenants 
the amount of credit available to the company under the agreement at any given time is determined by an availability calculation  based on the eligible borrowing base  as defined in the credit agreement  which includes the company s outstanding receivables  inventories and equipment  with certain exclusions 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
amounts advanced under the credit facility bear interest at the day libor rate plus basis points 
the libor rate at march  was 
at march  and  the amounts outstanding against the line were  and  respectively 
at march   an additional  was available under the terms of the credit facility 
the company has not currently  nor in the past  engaged in the use of structured finance arrangements  known as off balance sheet financing transactions  with unconsolidated entities or other persons 
the company has classified the  outstanding balance on its credit line as of march  as long term to reflect the terms included under the amendment signed on august  the following table of material debt and lease commitments at march  summarizes the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s cash flow in the future periods 
contractual obligations total long term bank debt   operating leases 
      capital leases     total       the respective years ended march   and resulted in the following changes in cash flow operating activities provided  and  respectively in and and used  in investing activities used   and  respectively  in  and and financing activities used  and  respectively  in and and provided  in net cash increased  in and decreased  and  respectively  in and cash provided by operating activities was  less for the year ended march   compared to principally due to decreases in earnings from continuing operations and inventory  partially offset by increases in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended march  was approximately  less than  principally due to decreased capital expenditures and proceeds from sale of assets 
cash used in financing activities was  less in compared to principally due to changes relating to borrowings under the line of credit 
during the fiscal year ended march  the company repurchased none of its common stock 
there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
the company paid a per share cash dividend in june and on may   the company declared that  due to losses sustained in fiscal  no common share dividend would be paid fiscal deferred retirement obligation contractual death benefits for the company s former chairman and chief executive officer who passed away on april  are payable by the company in the amount of  per year for years 
impact of inflation the company believes the impact of inflation and changing prices on its revenues and net earnings will not have a material effect on its manufacturing operations because increased costs due to inflation could be passed on to its customers  or on its air cargo business since the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed  without markup  under current contract terms 
outlook the company believes its ground support equipment order declines were largely the result of the economic downturn and effects of the september  terrorist attacks which particularly impacted the aviation sector of the economy 
the company s current forecast for fiscal suggests that the commercial aviation market will grow at a rate that is substantially less than the rest of the economy 
increased military and homeland security budgets  and pending funding approvals  may help offset the expected lower than normal order levels from commercial customers 
given the uncertainties associated with the above factors  the company continues to operate in a highly unpredictable environment 
as stated above  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  company management agreed to a plan to sell mas assets and to discontinue the operations of the company s aviation service sector business 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
based on the current general economic and industry outlook and cost cutting measures implemented over the past twelve months  the company believes its existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations  and funds available from current and renewed credit facilities will be adequate to meet its current and anticipated working capital requirements through if these sources are inadequate or become unavailable  then the company may pursue additional funds through the financing of unencumbered assets  although there is no assurance these additional funds will be sufficient to replace the sources that are inadequate or become unavailable 
actual results for fiscal will depend upon a number of factors beyond the company s control  including  in part  the timing  speed and magnitude of the economic recovery  military funding and commercial aviation capital spending

derivative financial instruments as required by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measures those instruments at fair value 
the company is exposed to market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
to manage the volatility relating to interest rate risk  the company may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
the company does not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company had outstanding two interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  and million respectively 
these agreements were originally entered into at respective interest rates of and respectively
