item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial information  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements and involves numerous risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those described in the section of this annual report on form k entitled certain factors that may affect future results 
our actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
casella is a vertically integrated regional solid waste services company that provides collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services to residential  industrial and commercial customers  primarily in the eastern region of the united states 
as of july   we owned and or operated five subtitle d landfills  two landfills permitted to accept construction and demolition materials  solid waste collection operations  transfer stations  recycling facilities and one waste to energy facility  as well as a interest in a joint venture that manufactures  markets and sells cellulose insulation made from recycled fiber 
from may  through december  we acquired solid waste collection  transfer and disposal operations 
in december  we acquired kti 
kti assets which we considered core to our operations included interests in waste to energy facilities in maine  significant residential and commercial recycling operations  transfer and collection operations which were tuck ins to existing operations and cellulose insulation manufacturing operations 
in addition  kti s assets included a number of businesses that were not core to our operating strategy 
following our acquisition of kti  we focused on the integration of kti and the divestiture of non core kti assets  which has now been completed 
as part of the divestiture program  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we incurred non recurring charges of million  of which million was non cash 
the divestiture program resulted in aggregate consideration of million  including cash proceeds of million which were used to reduce our indebtedness 
the divestitures reduced revenues in fiscal year by million from fiscal year since december  we have made acquisitions 
eight of our acquisitions during the three years ended april  were accounted for as poolings of interests 
under the rules governing poolings of interests  our financial statements were restated for all years prior to the acquisitions to reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of the merged entities as if they had been one company for all prior periods presented in the accompanying financial statements 
all of our other acquisitions  including kti  were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under the rules of purchase accounting  the acquired companies revenues and results of operations have been included together with those of ours from the actual dates of the acquisitions and materially affect the period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations 
as pooling accounting has been eliminated  all future acquisitions will be accounted for under the purchase method 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of their evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and circumstances 
our significant accounting policies are more fully discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
landfill accounting capitalized costs and amortization in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which outlines standards for accounting for an obligation associated with the retirement of a long lived tangible asset and the associated retirement costs 
this standard will impact our accounting for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
see note q of our consolidated financial statements for discussion of our adoption of sfas  effective may   and the related impact on our landfill accounting 
the following discussion of our landfill accounting is based on our accounting practices in effect during fiscal year  prior to the adoption of sfas we use life cycle accounting and the units of production method to recognize certain landfill costs 
under life cycle accounting  all costs related to the acquisition  construction  closure and post closure of landfill sites are capitalized or accrued and charged to income based on tonnage placed into each site 
capitalized landfill costs include expenditures for land and related airspace  permitting costs and preparation costs 
landfill permitting and preparation costs represent only direct costs related to these activities  including legal  engineering and construction 
landfill preparation costs include the costs of construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms and the installation of leak detection and leachate collection systems 
interest is capitalized on landfill permitting and construction projects while the assets are undergoing activities to ready them for their intended use 
management routinely reviews its investment in operating landfills  transfer stations and other significant facilities to determine whether the costs of these investments are realizable 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
landfill permitting  acquisition and preparation costs are amortized on the units of production method as landfill airspace is consumed 
in determining the amortization rate for these landfills  preparation costs include the total estimated costs to complete construction of the landfills permitted and permittable capacity 
to be considered permittable  airspace must meet all of the following criteria we control the land on which the expansion is sought  all technical siting criteria have been met or a variance has been obtained or is reasonably expected to be obtained  we have not identified any legal or political impediments which we believe will not be resolved in our favor  we are actively working on obtaining any necessary permits and we expect that all required permits will be received within the next two to five years  and senior management has approved the project 
units of production amortization rates are determined annually for each of our operating landfills 
the rates are based on estimates provided by our engineers and accounting personnel and consider the information provided by surveys  which are performed at least annually 
significant changes in our estimates could materially increase our landfill depletion rates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs  we consider the landfill costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
our estimate of future landfill permitting  acquisition  construction and preparation costs for the year ended april  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended april  and million for the year ended april   primarily as a result of additional permitted and permittable airspace at our existing landfills  which increased to approximately million tons as of april  as compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  the average landfill amortization rate per ton for the years ended april   and was  and  respectively 
landfill amortization expense for the years ended april   and was million  million and million  respectively 
landfill accounting accrued closure and post closure costs accrued closure and post closure costs represent future estimated costs related to monitoring and maintenance of a solid waste landfill  after a landfill facility ceases to accept waste and closes 
we estimate  based on input from our engineers  accounting personnel and consultants  our future cost requirements for closure and post closure monitoring and maintenance based on our interpretation of the technical standards of the subtitle d regulations and the air emissions standards under the clean air act as they are being applied on a state by state basis 
closure and post closure accruals for the cost of monitoring and maintenance include final capping of the site  site inspection  groundwater monitoring  leachate management  methane gas control and recovery  and operation and maintenance costs to be incurred during the period after the facility closes 
we provide accruals for these estimated future costs on an undiscounted basis as the remaining permitted airspace of such facilities is consumed 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in determining estimated future closure and post closure costs  we consider costs associated with permitted and permittable airspace 
our estimate of future closure and post closure costs is million for the year ended april   as compared to million for the year ended april  and million for the year ended april  additional permitted and permittable airspace at our existing landfills increased to approximately million tons as of april   as compared to million tons as of april  and million tons as of april  the average landfill closure and post closure expense per ton was  and for the years ended april   and  respectively 
accrued closure and post closure costs include the current and non current portion of costs associated with obligations for closure and post closure of our landfills 
the changes to accrued closure and post closure liabilities are as follows years ended april  balance  beginning of year    charged to operating expense    spending applied against the accrual  acquisitions and other adjustments   balance  end of year    spending levels increased in fiscal year mainly due to closure activities at our woburn  massachusetts and pine tree  maine landfills 
in fiscal year  we recorded additional post closure accruals relating to one of our construction and demolition landfills 
in fiscal year  we recorded closure and post closure accruals relating to the hardwick landfill acquisition 
we estimate our future closure and post closure costs in order to determine the closure and post closure expense per ton of waste placed into each landfill as further described in note l to our consolidated financial statements 
the anticipated timeframe for paying these costs varies based on the remaining useful life of each landfill  as well as the duration of the post closure monitoring period 
based on our permitted and permittable airspace at april   we expect to make payments relative to closure and post closure activities from fiscal through fiscal asset impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we continually review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of such assets might warrant revision or that the balances may not be recoverable 
we evaluate possible impairment by comparing estimated future cash flows  before interest expense and on an undiscounted basis  with the net book value of long term assets including amortizable intangible assets 
if undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover assets  further analysis is performed in order to determine the amount of the impairment 
an impairment loss is then recorded equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
fair value is usually determined based on the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we adopted sfas no 
effective may  and  have eliminated the amortization of goodwill and annually assess goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
sfas no 
requires that any goodwill recorded in connection with an acquisition consummated on or after july  not be amortized 
bad debt allowance estimates are used in determining our allowance for bad debts and are based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and a review of our accounts receivable by aging category 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are self insured for vehicles and workers compensation 
the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is determined by a third party actuary and reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by our past claims experience  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
discontinued operations in april  we adopted a formal plan to dispose of our tire processing  commercial recycling and mulch recycling businesses 
we have accounted for these planned dispositions in accordance with apb opinion no 
 reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and accordingly  the discontinued businesses are carried at estimated net realizable value less costs to be incurred through the date of disposition 
assets held for sale and liabilities of operations held for sale are stated at their expected realizable values and have been separately classified in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income tax accruals we record income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income taxes are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  calculated using currently enacted tax rates 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that tax benefits may not be realized for certain deferred tax assets 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k and other reports  proxy statements  and other communications to stockholders  as well as oral statements by the company s officers or its agents  may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act  with respect to  among other things  the company s future revenues  operating income  or earnings per share 
without limiting the foregoing  any statements contained in this annual report on form k that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements  and the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors of which the company is aware that may cause the company s actual results to vary materially from those forecasted or projected in any such forward looking statement  certain of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include  without limitation  those outlined below in the section entitled certain factors that may affect future results 
the company s failure to successfully address any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
general revenues our revenues in our eastern  central and western regions are attributable primarily to fees charged to customers for solid waste disposal and collection  landfill  waste to energy  transfer and recycling services 
we derive a substantial portion of our collection revenues from commercial  industrial and municipal services that are generally performed under service agreements or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
the majority of our residential collection services are performed on a subscription basis with individual households 
landfill  waste to energy facility and transfer customers are charged a tipping fee on a per ton basis for disposing of their solid waste at our disposal facilities and transfer stations 
the majority of our disposal and transfer customers are under one to ten year disposal contracts  with most having clauses for annual cost of living increases 
recycling revenues  which are included in fcr and in the eastern  central and western regions  consist of revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities and operations and maintenance contracts of recycling facilities for municipal customers 
fcr revenues include revenues from brokerage operations 
effective august   we contributed our cellulose insulation assets to a joint venture with louisiana pacific  and accordingly  since that date have recognized half of the joint venture s net income loss on the equity method in our results of operations 
in the other segment  we have ancillary revenues including residue recycling and major customer accounts 
our revenues are shown net of intercompany eliminations 
we typically establish our intercompany transfer pricing based upon prevailing market rates 
the table below shows  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our total revenues attributable to services provided 
collection revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal year remained unchanged 
collection revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to the effects of price and volume increases 
the increase in fiscal year landfill disposal facilities revenues compared to fiscal year is mainly due to increased volumes during the first part of compared to the same period in fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year landfill disposal facilities revenues compared to fiscal year is mainly attributable to the disposition of our majority interest in penobscot energy recovery company perc  which occurred late in fiscal year transfer revenues as a percentage of total revenues have continued to increase between years due to an increase in transfer volumes 
the increase in recycling revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to higher commodity prices and volumes 
the increase in recycling revenues as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal year compared to the prior year is due to higher volumes partially offset by lower average prices 
the decrease in brokerage revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to fiscal year is due to lower commodity prices and volumes as well as the transfer of the export business to the employees of that unit in september our domestic brokerage operations  constituting the remainder of our brokerage revenues were transferred effective june  to the employees of that unit 
the decrease in our brokerage revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal year compared to the prior year is primarily attributable to the overall effects of commodity prices 
the decrease in our other revenues as a percentage of revenues during fiscal year and is primarily attributable to divestitures made during both periods 
of revenues fiscal year collection landfill disposal facilities transfer recycling brokerage other total revenues we revised percentages of total revenues for fiscal year and fiscal year to conform with classification of revenues attributable to services provided in fiscal year operating expenses cost of operations includes labor  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  fuel  maintenance and repair of vehicles and equipment  worker s compensation and vehicle insurance  the cost of purchasing materials to be recycled  third party transportation expense  district and state taxes  host community fees and royalties 
landfill operating expenses also include a provision for closure and post closure expenditures anticipated to be incurred in the future  and leachate treatment and disposal costs 
general and administration expenses include management  clerical and administrative compensation and overhead  professional services and costs associated with our marketing  sales force and community relations efforts 
depreciation and amortization expense includes depreciation of fixed assets over the estimated useful life of the assets using the straight line method  amortization of landfill airspace assets under the units of production method  and the amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method 
goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
the amount of landfill amortization expense related to airspace consumption can vary materially from landfill to landfill depending upon the purchase price and landfill site and cell development costs 
we depreciate all fixed and intangible assets  excluding non depreciable land  down to a zero net book value  and do not apply a salvage value to any of our fixed assets 
we capitalize certain direct landfill development costs  such as engineering  permitting  legal  construction and other costs associated directly with the expansion of existing landfills 
additionally  we also capitalize certain third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions  such as legal and engineering costs 
we will have material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for future financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of our landfills generally for a term of years after final closure based on engineering estimates of consumption of permitted landfill airspace over the useful life of any such landfill 
our financial obligations for closure or post closure costs may exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds 
we routinely evaluate all such capitalized costs  and expense those costs related to projects not likely to be successful 
internal and indirect landfill development and acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  are expensed as incurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage relationship that certain items from our consolidated statements of operations bear in relation to revenues 
fiscal year of revenues revenues cost of operations general and administration depreciation and amortization impairment charge restructuring charge legal settlements other miscellaneous charges operating income loss interest expense  net income loss from equity method investments  net other income expense  net provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations before discontinued operations  extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year divested businesses accounted for a decrease of approximately million 
these decreases were offset by price and volume increases in the core solid waste business amounting to million  higher commodity prices and volumes represented million and the positive rollover effect of acquisitions amounted to approximately million 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase arose mainly from higher insurance costs  partially offset by operating improvements in direct labor and lower commodity purchases resulting from the sale of the export brokerage business 
the increased insurance costs arose mainly from a negative actuarial adjustment of million related to our captive insurance company in fiscal versus a positive adjustment of million in fiscal general and administration 
general and administration expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administration expenses increased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in general and administration expenses was primarily the result of legal and insurance expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was mainly attributable to the company adopting sfas which eliminates recognition of goodwill amortization  partially offset by higher landfill amortization expense due to volume increases 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year interest expense  net 
net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on variable rate debt in the current year  versus the prior period 
interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded an impairment charge of million to adjust the book value of the domestic brokerage and commercial recycling businesses to net realizable value 
income loss from equity method investments  net 
income from equity method investments in fiscal year of million and million in fiscal year reflects equity income in our joint venture interest in greenfiber 
minority interest 
this amount represented the minority owners interest in our majority owned subsidiary american ash recycling of tennessee  ltd  which was dissolved in february other income expense  net 
other income was million in fiscal year compared to million in other expenses in fiscal year this decrease is attributable to the difference in gain on divestitures 
in addition there was a gain of million in fiscal year related to a settlement with oakhurst company  inc  partially offset by a million charge for interest rate swap unwind costs 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million for fiscal year to million from million for fiscal year the effective tax rate increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year this was primarily due to an increase in the valuation allowance for loss carryforwards  nondeductible impairment of goodwill and the loss on the sale of a significant portion of our interest in new heights in fiscal year  partially offset by the decrease in nondeductible goodwill amortization  recognition of additional tax losses from new heights and the elimination of capital loss carryforwards 
reclassification from discontinued operations  net 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into negotiations with former employees for the transfer of our domestic brokerage operation and a commercial recycling business 
the commercial recycling business had been accounted for as a discontinued operation since fiscal due to the nature of the transaction  we could not retain discontinued accounting treatment for this operation 
therefore the commercial recycling business has been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations for fiscal  and in fiscal  we estimated and accrued for anticipated future losses from this business which were recorded and classified as losses from discontinued operations 
this amount has been reclassified and offset against actual losses from operations in fiscal  and estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net 
the estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations for the fiscal year is primarily due to the loss on the sale of the commercial recycling business 
extraordinary loss early extinguishment of debt  net 
in fiscal year  we entered into a new senior secured credit facility resulting in the extinguishment of million net of tax benefit of million in debt financing costs associated with the old senior secured credit facility 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
effective may   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which  among other things  eliminates the amortization of goodwill and requires an annual assessment of goodwill impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill was determined to be impaired and the amount of million net of tax benefit of million was charged to earnings in fiscal year as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the goodwill impairment charge was related to our waste to energy operation  maine energy  and the brokerage business of the fcr recycling segment  both of which were acquired as part of our acquisition of kti 
at the time of acquisition  we recorded the fair value of these businesses using an independent third party valuation 
the underlying assumptions used to establish the value of these businesses  including earnings projections  commodity pricing assumptions and industry valuation multiples for recycling products  were not realized 
accordingly  goodwill impairment charges were recorded as the net book value of these businesses exceeded their fair value 
in fiscal year  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which resulted in a charge to earnings as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the amount of million net of tax benefit of million for the portion of interest rate swap hedges determined to be ineffective 
fiscal year versus fiscal year revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year divested businesses accounted for approximately million of the decrease  while lower average brokerage commodity prices and volumes represented million of the decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by price and volume increases in the core solid waste business amounting to million and the positive rollover effect of acquisitions amounting to approximately million 
cost of operations 
cost of operations decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease arose mainly from lower volumes of recyclable material purchases and divestitures 
cost of operations as a percentage of revenues decreased to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in cost of operations as a percentage of revenues was primarily the result of a decreased contribution from brokerage operations  which carry a high cost of operations as a percentage of revenues of approximately 
general and administration 
general and administration expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year general and administration expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in general and administration expenses was primarily the result of divestitures as well as lower legal and bad debt expenses 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the decrease was attributable to lower intangible amortization due to the impairment charge taken in fiscal year and the impact of divested entities 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenues increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from a lower level of revenues 
impairment charge 
in fiscal  we determined that certain assets mainly goodwill were impaired and therefore recorded a charge of million to reduce those assets to their estimated fair value 
the assets impaired mainly arose from the acquisition of kti 
restructuring charge 
a restructuring charge of million in fiscal year represents the reversal of certain unrealized fiscal year restructuring expenses  partially offset by additional restructuring charges expensed in fiscal year interest expense  net 
net interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily attributable to lower average debt balances and lower interest rates on variable debt in the current period  versus the prior period 
interest expense  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year income loss from equity method investments  net 
income from equity method investments in fiscal year of million reflects equity income in our joint venture interest in greenfiber amounting to million  offset by a million loss related to our further investment in the new heights tire processing business 
in the prior year  we recorded our share of a loss of million  recorded at greenfiber due to significant transitional and restructuring expenses 
in fiscal year  equity method investment losses also included a million loss attributable to impairment charges taken to reduce our investment in oakhurst company  inc oci and new heights recovery and power  llc new heights 
a portion of our interest in new heights was sold in september for consideration of million 
we retained an interest of in the tire recycling assets of new heights  as well as financial obligations related solely to the new heights power plant 
in addition  we have an interest in certain notes granted by new heights collectively valued at approximately million  payment of which is contingent upon certain events 
we will record the contingent consideration when the contingency is removed 
we are accounting for our retained investment under the cost method of accounting 
minority interest 
at april   this amount represented the minority owners interest in aart  which recorded a loss for the period 
at april  minority interest reflected the minority owners interest in our majority owned subsidiaries maine energy and perc 
effective march   we acquired the remaining minority interest in maine energy and sold our majority interest in perc 
other income expense  net 
other income was million in fiscal year compared to million in other expenses in fiscal year this increase is attributable to the divestitures of multitrade and s s commercial  which resulted in a gain of million 
other income in fiscal year also includes a gain on the sale of bangor hydro warrants of million and gains on the sale of equipment of million  offset by the write off of million of commodity hedges due to the bankruptcy of enron  as well as impairment of our us plastic lumber corp 
equity holdings  amounting to million 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes increased million in fiscal year to million from a benefit of million in fiscal year this increase  as well as the change in the effective tax rate to  is primarily due to the change in pretax income to a profit  the tax benefit from the sale of of our equity interest in new heights in fiscal year and the write off of non deductible goodwill and the equity loss in oci and in new heights in fiscal year reclassification from discontinued operations  net 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we entered into negotiations with former employees for the transfer of our domestic brokerage operations and a commercial recycling business 
the commercial recycling business had been accounted for as a discontinued operation since fiscal due to the nature of the transaction  we could not retain discontinued accounting treatment for this operation 
therefore the commercial recycling business operating results have been reclassified from discontinued to continuing operations for fiscal  and in fiscal  we estimated and accrued for anticipated future losses from this business which were recorded and classified as losses from discontinued operations 
this amount has been reclassified and offset against actual losses from operations in fiscal  and estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net 
estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the estimated loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net in fiscal year was attributable to the loss on the sale of discontinued assets exceeding our estimates by million  partially offset by positive operating results of million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
on may   we adopted sfas no 
establishing accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
because the relevant terms of certain interest rate swaps and the specific debts that they were designated to hedge were not identical  we recorded the ineffective portion of the hedge amounting to a loss of million net of tax benefit of million as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
liquidity and capital resources our business is capital intensive 
capital requirements include acquisitions  fixed asset purchases and capital expenditures for landfill development and cell construction as well as site and cell closure 
we had a net working capital deficit of million at april  compared to a net working capital deficit of million at april  working capital  net comprises current assets  excluding cash and cash equivalents  minus current liabilities 
the main factors accounting for the decrease were higher trade payable and accrual balances  lower current deferred taxes  partially offset by decreases in current portion of debt payments and interest rate swap liabilities 
we had a net working capital of million at april  the decrease from april  to april  is due primarily to lower trade receivables  the sale of assets of discontinued operations and assets held for sale  the sale of current investments and the increase in the current portion of accrued closure and post closure costs 
in  the allowance for doubtful accounts was substantially reduced from fiscal year because of our focus on collections and the resulting significant reduction in the old amounts outstanding during the period 
in  the allowance for doubtful accounts remained relatively unchanged from fiscal year we have a million credit facility with a group of banks for which fleet bank  na is acting as agent 
this credit facility consists of a million senior secured revolving credit facility revolver and a senior secured term b loan  which had an outstanding balance of million at april  term loan 
we have the right to increase the amount of the revolver and or the term loan by an aggregate amount of up to million at our discretion  provided that we are not in default at the time of the increase  subject to the receipt of commitments from lenders for such additional amount 
the new term loan and revolving credit facility agreement contains covenants that may limit our activities  including covenants that restrict dividends and stock repurchases  limit capital expenditures  and set minimum net worth and profitability requirements and interest coverage and leverage ratios 
as of april   we considered the profitability covenant  which requires our cumulative adjusted net income for any two consecutive quarters to be positive  to be the most restrictive 
as of april   we were in compliance with this covenant as we reported consolidated adjusted net income of million for the six months ended april  consolidated adjusted net income is defined by the credit facility agreement 
in accordance with such definition  consolidated net income  determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  is adjusted for elimination of certain nonrecurring charges  extraordinary gains  income from discontinued operations and non cash income attributable to equity investments 
we used the net proceeds from the offering of the old notes and initial borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities to repay all outstanding amounts under our old senior secured credit facilities  for fees and expenses related to the offering of the old notes and the new senior secured credit facilities and general corporate purposes 
as of april   assuming the issuance of all existing letters of credit under our new senior secured credit facilities  we would have had available borrowing capacity under our new million revolving credit facility of up to million  subject to our ability to meet certain borrowing conditions 
we intend to use the additional availability under our new senior secured credit facilities to support our acquisition program 
this credit facility is secured by all of our assets  including its interest in the equity securities of its subsidiaries 
the revolver matures in january and the term loan matures in january we have outstanding million of senior subordinated notes the notes 
the notes mature in january the senior subordinated note agreement contains covenants that restrict dividends  stock repurchases and other payments  and limits the incurrence of debt and issuance of preferred stock subject to our meeting a minimum consolidated fixed charge ratio 
the notes are guaranteed jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally by our significant wholly owned subsidiaries 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which the notes were issued  we are required to file a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to an exchange offer pursuant to which holders of the notes will have the right to exchange the notes for substantially similar registered notes 
due to the need to revise our financial statements for for the reasons set forth elsewhere in this form k  this registration statement has not yet become effective 
accordingly  we will be required to pay the holders  as liquidated damages  an amount per annum equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes for the first day period commencing july   and an increased amount thereafter until the registration statement has been declared effective 
we believe that the registration statement will be declared effective within this initial day period 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year and fiscal year amounted to million and million  respectively 
the decrease was mainly due to the cash outflows from landfill closure activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year increased by million from in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the change in our working capital  reflecting an improvement in our accounts receivable collections and an increase in the current portion of accrued closure and post closure costs 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year and fiscal year amounted to million and million  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities reflected mainly lower proceeds from divestitures and an increase in acquisitions 
the increase in cash used in investing activities between years was also as a result of higher capital expenditures  which increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year net cash used in investing activities in fiscal year decreased by million from in fiscal year the decrease in cash used in investing activities reflected higher proceeds from divestitures and fewer acquisitions 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities between and was also as a result of lower capital expenditures  which decreased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year net cash provided in financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to net cash used by financing activities of in fiscal year this increase was primarily due to paying down less debt  net of borrowings  than in fiscal year  partially offset by refinancing costs of million 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal year decreased million from net cash provided in fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to paying down debt with proceeds from the divestitures 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year capital spending was higher in fiscal year mainly due to capital expenditures related to the upgrade of the truck fleet and facilities 
our capital expenditures in fiscal year decreased million from in fiscal year the decrease was primarily related to a significant non recurring capital project in associated with maine energy odor control  and the upgrade of our truck fleet and containers 
we expect capital spending to total approximately million in fiscal year during fiscal year  we completed eight acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in notes payable and other consideration 
in comparison  during fiscal year  we completed four acquisitions for an aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million in notes payable and other consideration 
in fiscal year  we completed our previously announced divestiture program which was announced in march  from which we received total consideration of million  including cash proceeds of million which were used to reduce our indebtedness 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of april  in thousands and the anticipated effect of these obligations on its liquidity in future years fiscal year s thereafter total long term debt      capital lease obligations   interest obligations     operating leases      closure post closure      redeemable preferred securities   total contractual cash obligations    interest obligations based on long term debt and capital lease balances as of april  interest obligations related to variable rate debt calculated using variable rates in effect at april  assumes redemption on the seventh anniversary of the closing date at the book value which includes all accrued and unpaid dividends 
contractual cash obligations do not include accounts payable or accrued liabilities  which will be paid in fiscal year we believe that our cash provided internally from operations together with our senior secured credit facility should enable us to meet our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions to date  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we therefore believe we should be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors may require us to absorb at least a portion of these cost increases  particularly during periods of high inflation 
our business is located mainly in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to downturns in the general economy in this geographic region and other factors affecting the region  such as state regulations and severe weather conditions 
we are unable to forecast or determine the timing and or the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
applies to all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
for us  this standard primarily impacts our accounting for our landill operations  specifically closure and post closure costs 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes the cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  the entity either settles the obligation for the amount recorded or incurs a gain or loss 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we will adopt sfas no 
beginning may  the adoption of this standard will have no impact on cash flow 
sfas no 
does not change the basic accounting principles that we historically followed for accounting for these types of obligations 
in general  we have followed the practice of life cycle accounting which recognizes a liability on the balance sheet and related expense as airspace is consumed at the landfill  in order to match operating costs with revenues 
the primary modification to our methodology required by sfas no 
is to require closure and post closure costs to be discounted to present value 
our estimates of future closure and post closure costs historically have not taken into account discounts for the present value of costs to be paid in the future 
under sfas no 
 our estimates of costs to discharge asset retirement obligations for landfills are developed in today s dollars 
these costs are then inflated each year to reflect a normal escalation of prices up to the year they are expected to be paid 
these estimated costs are then discounted to their present value using a credit adjusted risk free rate 
under sfas no 
 we will no longer accrue landfill retirement obligations through a charge to cost of operations  but rather by an increase to landfill assets 
under sfas no 
 the amortizable landfill assets include not only the landfill development costs incurred but also the recorded capping  closure and post closure liabilities as well as the cost estimates for future capping  closure and post closure costs 
the landfill asset is amortized over the total capacity of the landfill  as airspace is consumed during the life of the landfill with one exception 
the exception is for final capping for which both the recognition of the liability and the amortization of these costs are based instead on the airspace consumed for the specific capping event 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on may   we expect to record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  net of taxes of 
we expect that the impact of adopting sfas no 
in fiscal as well as our annual update of cost estimates  will decrease operating income by following is a summary of the expected balance sheet changes for landfill assets and capping  closure and post closure liabilities at may  in thousands balance at april  change balance at may  landfill assets    accumulated amortization    net landfill assets    capping  closure  and post closure liability   in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
 among other things  restricts the classification of gains and losses from extinguishment of debt as extraordinary such that most debt extinguishment gains and losses will no longer be classified as extraordinary 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  upon adoption  gain and losses on debt extinguishment  if any  will be recorded in pre tax income 
during fiscal year  we recorded an extraordinary loss of  net of income tax of  in connection with the write off of deferred financing costs related to the old term loan and the old revolver 
this item will be reclassified to continuing operations in fiscal in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses costs such as restructuring  involuntary termination of employees and consolidating facilities but excludes from its scope exit and disposal activities that are in connection with a business combination and those activities to which sfas no 
and no 
are applicable 
sfas no 
is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  we have not engaged in or initiated any exit and disposal activities since december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used in reporting results 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have included the required disclosures in these financial statements 
management is evaluating the effect of this statement on our results of operations and financial position as well as related disclosures 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
fin 
fin requires that unconsolidated variable interest entities be consolidated by their primary beneficiary who absorbs a majority of the entities expected losses or residual benefits 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing variable interest entities in the periods beginning after june  management is evaluating the effect of this statement on our results of operations and financial position as well as related disclosures 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liability and equity 
the statement changes the accounting of certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
the new statement requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  management is evaluating the effect of the statement on our results of operations and financial positions as well as related disclosures 
certain factors that may affect future results the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
the company s increased leverage may restrict its future operations and impact its ability to make future acquisitions 
as a result of the acquisition of kti  our indebtedness increased substantially 
in addition  our indebtedness has increased further as a result of our new credit facility and the completion of the offering of the senior subordinated notes 
the payment of interest and principal due under this indebtedness has reduced  and may continue to reduce  funds available for other business purposes  including capital expenditures and acquisitions 
in addition  the aggregate amount of indebtedness has limited and may continue to limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  and thereby may limit its acquisition program 
we may not be successful in making acquisitions of solid waste assets  including developing additional disposal capacity  or in integrating acquired businesses or assets  which could limit our future growth 
our strategy envisions that a substantial part of our future growth will come from making acquisitions of traditional solid waste assets or operations and acquiring or developing additional disposal capacity 
these acquisitions may include tuck in acquisitions within our existing markets  assets that are adjacent to or outside our existing markets  or larger  more strategic acquisitions 
in addition  from time to time we may acquire businesses that are complementary to our core business strategy 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
if we identify suitable acquisition candidates  we may be unable to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us 
furthermore  we may be unable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval to complete potential acquisitions 
our ability to achieve the benefits we anticipate from acquisitions  including cost savings and operating efficiencies  depends in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with our operations 
the integration of acquired businesses and other assets may require significant management time and company resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing management of our existing operations 
in addition  the process of acquiring or developing additional disposal capacity is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
for example  we are currently involved in litigation with the town of bethlehem  new hampshire relating to the expansion of a landfill owned by our wholly owned subsidiary  north country environmental services  inc moreover  the disposal capacity at our existing landfills is limited by the remaining available volume at our landfills and annual and or daily disposal limits imposed by the various governmental authorities with jurisdiction over our landfills 
we typically reach or approximate our daily and annual maximum permitted disposal capacity at all of our landfills 
if we are unable to develop or acquire additional disposal capacity  our ability to achieve economies from the internalization of our waste stream will be limited and we may be required to increase our utilization of disposal facilities owned by third parties  which could reduce our revenues and or our operating margins 
our ability to make acquisitions is dependent on the availability of adequate cash and the attractiveness of our stock price 
we anticipate that any future business acquisitions will be financed through cash from operations  borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities  the issuance of shares of our class a common stock and or seller financing 
we may not have sufficient existing capital resources and may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  in order to meet our capital requirements for such acquisitions 
we also believe that a significant factor in our ability to close acquisitions will be the attractiveness to us and to persons selling businesses to us of our class a common stock as consideration for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital appreciation prospects of our class a common stock compared to the equity securities of our competitors 
the trading price of our class a common stock on the nasdaq national market has limited our willingness to use our equity as consideration and the willingness of sellers to accept our shares and as a result has limited  and could continue to limit  the size and scope of our acquisition program 
environmental regulations and litigation could subject us to fines  penalties  judgments and limitations on our ability to expand 
we are subject to potential liability and restrictions under environmental laws  including those relating to transport  recycling  treatment  storage and disposal of wastes  discharges to air and water  and the remediation of contaminated soil  surface water and groundwater 
the waste management industry has been and will continue to be subject to regulation  including permitting and related financial assurance requirements  as well as to attempts to further regulate the industry through new legislation 
our waste to energy and manufacturing facilities are subject to regulations limiting discharges of pollution into the air and water  and our solid waste operations are subject to a wide range of federal  state and  in some cases  local environmental  odor and noise and land use restrictions 
for example  our waste to energy facility in biddeford  maine is affected by zoning restrictions and air emissions limitations in its efforts to implement a new odor control system 
see business regulation state and local regulations 
if we are not able to comply with the requirements that apply to a particular facility or if we operate without necessary approvals  we could be subject to civil  and possibly criminal  fines and penalties  and we may be required to spend substantial capital to bring an operation into compliance or to temporarily or permanently discontinue  and or take corrective actions  possibly including removal of landfilled materials  regarding an operation that is not permitted under the law 
we may not have sufficient insurance coverage for our environmental liabilities 
those costs or actions could be significant to us and impact our results of operations  as well as our available capital 
environmental and land use laws also impact our ability to expand and  in the case of our solid waste operations  may dictate those geographic areas from which we must  or  from which we may not  accept waste 
those laws and regulations may limit the overall size and daily waste volume that may be accepted by a solid waste operation 
if we are not able to expand or otherwise operate one or more of our facilities because of limits imposed under environmental laws  we may be required to increase our utilization of disposal facilities owned by third parties  which could reduce our revenues and or operating margins 
we have historically grown and intend to continue to grow through acquisitions  and we have tried and will continue to try to evaluate and address environmental risks and liabilities presented by newly acquired businesses as we have identified them 
it is possible that some liabilities  including ones that may exist only because of the past operations of an acquired business  may prove to be more difficult or costly to address than we anticipate 
it is also possible that government officials responsible for enforcing environmental laws may believe an issue is more serious than we would expect  or that we will fail to identify or fully appreciate an existing liability before we become legally responsible to address it 
some of the legal sanctions to which we could become subject could cause us to lose a needed permit  or prevent us from or delay us in obtaining or renewing permits to operate our facilities or harm our reputation 
our operating program depends on our ability to operate and expand the landfills we own and lease and to develop new landfill sites 
localities where we operate generally seek to regulate some or all landfill operations  including siting and expansion of operations 
the laws adopted by municipalities in which our landfills are located may limit or prohibit the expansion of the landfill as well as the amount of waste that we can accept at the landfill on a daily or annual basis and any effort to acquire or expand landfills typically involves a significant amount of time and expense 
for example  expansion at our north county environmental services  inc landfill will require the new hampshire supreme court to overturn a lower court ruling which interpreted a local ordinance to prohibit expansion of the landfill with respect to million tons of capacity  and expansion of our hyland landfill is subject to the passage of a town wide referendum 
we may not be successful in obtaining new landfill sites or expanding the permitted capacity of any of our current landfills once their remaining disposal capacity has been consumed 
if we are unable to develop additional disposal capacity  our ability to achieve economies from the internalization of our waste stream will be limited and we will be required to utilize the disposal facilities of our competitors 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations  we incur costs defending against environmental litigation brought by governmental agencies and private parties 
we are  and also may be in the future  defendants in lawsuits brought by parties alleging environmental damage  personal injury  and or property damage 
for example  we are one of over twenty defendants named in a toxic tort lawsuit filed on july  by residents surrounding three sites in cheektowaga  new york alleging  among other things  that we have liability as a result of our airspace agreement at the schultz construction and demolition debris landfill 
in addition  we are also a defendant in a lawsuit filed on january  by the city of biddeford  maine alleging  among other things  that our subsidiary  maine energy  processed amounts of waste above contractual limits without notice to the city 
a significant judgment against us could harm our business  our prospects and our reputation 
see business regulation and business legal proceedings 
our operations would be adversely affected if we do not have access to sufficient capital 
our ability to remain competitive and sustain our operations depends in part on cash flow from operations and our access to capital 
we intend to fund our cash needs primarily through cash from operations and borrowings under our new senior secured credit facilities 
however  we may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment obligations and to fund our growth and operations 
in addition  if we undertake more acquisitions or further expand our operations  our capital requirements may increase 
we may not have access to the amount of capital that we require from time to time  on favorable terms or at all 
our results of operations could continue to be affected by changing prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be affected by changing purchase or resale prices or market requirements for recyclable materials 
our recycling business involves the purchase and sale of recyclable materials  some of which are priced on a commodity basis 
the resale and purchase prices of  and market demand for  recyclable materials  particularly waste paper  plastic and ferrous and aluminum metals  can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control 
although we seek to limit our exposure to fluctuating commodity prices through the use of hedging agreements and long term supply contracts with customers  these changes have in the past contributed  and may continue to contribute  to significant variability in our period to period results of operations 
our business is geographically concentrated and is therefore subject to regional economic downturns 
our operations and customers are principally located in the eastern united states 
therefore  our business  financial condition and results of operations are susceptible to regional economic downturns and other regional factors  including state regulations and budget constraints and severe weather conditions 
in addition  as we expand in our existing markets  opportunities for growth within these regions will become more limited and the geographic concentration of our business will increase 
maine energy may be required to make a payment in connection with the payoff of certain obligations and limited partner loans earlier than we had anticipated and which may exceed the amount of the liability we recorded in connection with the kti acquisition 
under the terms of waste handling agreements among the biddeford saco waste handling committee  the cities of biddeford and saco  maine  other muncipalities and our subsidiary maine energy  maine energy will be required  following the date on which the bonds that financed maine energy and certain limited partner loans to maine energy are paid in full  to pay a residual cancellation payment to the respective municipalities party to those agreements equal to an aggregate of of the fair market value of the equity of the partners in maine energy 
in connection with our merger with kti  we estimated the fair market value of maine energy as of the date the limited partner loans are anticipated to be paid in full  and recorded a liability equal to of such amount 
our estimate of the fair market value of maine energy may not prove to be accurate  and in the event we have underestimated the value of maine energy  we could be required to recognize unanticipated charges  in which case our operating results could be harmed 
in connection with these waste handling agreements  the cities of biddeford and saco and the additional municipalities that were parties to the agreements have filed lawsuits in the state of maine seeking the residual cancellation payments and alleging  among other things  our breach of the waste handling agreement for our failure to pay the residual cancellation payments in connection with the kti merger  failure to pay off limited partner loans in accordance with the terms of the agreement and processing amounts of waste above contractual limits without issuance of proper notice 
the complaint seeks damages for breach of contract and a court order requiring us to provide an accounting of all relevant transactions since may  if the plaintiffs are successful in their claims against us and damages are awarded our operating income in the period in which such a claim is paid would be impacted 
see business legal proceedings 
we may not be able to effectively compete in the highly competitive solid waste services industry 
the solid waste services industry is highly competitive  has undergone a period of rapid consolidation and requires substantial labor and capital resources 
some of the markets in which we compete or will likely compete are served by one or more of the large national or multinational solid waste companies  as well as numerous regional and local solid waste companies 
intense competition exists not only to provide services to customers  but also to acquire other businesses within each market 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than us 
from time to time  competitors may reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid contract 
these practices may either require us to reduce the pricing of our services or result in our loss of business 
as is generally the case in the industry  some municipal contracts are subject to periodic competitive bidding 
we may not be the successful bidder to obtain or retain these contracts 
if we are unable to compete with larger and better capitalized companies  or to replace municipal contracts lost through the competitive bidding process with comparable contracts or other revenue sources within a reasonable time period our revenues would decrease and our operating results would be harmed 
in our solid waste disposal markets we also compete with operators of alternative disposal and recycling facilities and with counties  municipalities and solid waste districts that maintain their own waste collection  recycling and disposal operations 
these entities may have financial advantages because user fees or similar charges  tax revenues and tax exempt financing may be more available to them than to us 
our greenfiber insulation manufacturing joint venture with louisiana pacific corporation competes with other parties  principally national manufacturers of fiberglass insulation  which have substantially greater resources than greenfiber does  which they could use for product development  marketing or other purposes to our detriment 
our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected if we inadequately accrue for closure and post closure costs 
we have material financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of our existing landfills and will have material financial obligations with respect to any disposal facilities which we may own or operate in the future 
once the permitted capacity of a particular landfill is reached and additional capacity is not authorized  the landfill must be closed and capped  and post closure maintenance started 
we establish reserves for the estimated costs associated with such closure and post closure obligations over the anticipated useful life of each landfill on a per ton basis 
in addition to the landfills we currently operate  we own four unlined landfills  which are not currently in operation 
we have provided and will in the future provide accruals for financial obligations relating to closure and post closure costs of our owned or operated landfills  generally for a term of years after final closure of a landfill 
our financial obligations for closure or post closure costs could exceed the amount accrued and reserved or amounts otherwise receivable pursuant to trust funds established for this purpose 
such a circumstance could result in significant unanticipated charges 
fluctuations in fuel costs could affect our operating expenses and results 
the price and supply of fuel is unpredictable and fluctuates based on events beyond our control  including among others  geopolitical developments  supply and demand for oil and gas  actions by opec and other oil and gas producers  war and unrest in oil producing countries and regional production patterns 
because fuel is needed to run our fleet of trucks  price escalations for fuel increase our operating expenses 
during fiscal  we used approximately million gallons of diesel fuel in our solid waste operations 
although many of our customer contracts permit us to pass on some or all fuel increases to our customers  we may choose not to do so for competitive reasons 
we could be precluded from entering into contracts or obtaining permits if we are unable to obtain third party financial assurance to secure our contractual obligations 
municipal solid waste collection and recycling contracts  obligations associated with landfill closure and the operation and closure of waste to energy facilities may require performance or surety bonds  letters of credit or other means of financial assurance to secure our contractual performance 
if we are unable to obtain the necessary financial assurance in sufficient amounts or at acceptable rates  we could be precluded from entering into additional municipal solid waste collection contracts or from obtaining or retaining landfill operating permits 
any future difficulty in obtaining insurance could also impair our ability to secure future contracts conditioned upon the contractor having adequate insurance coverage 
we may be required to write off capitalized charges or intangible assets in the future  which could harm our earnings 
any write off of capitalized costs or intangible assets reduces our earnings and  consequently  could affect the market price of our class a common stock 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we capitalize certain expenditures and advances relating to our acquisitions  pending acquisitions  landfills and development projects 
from time to time in future periods  we may be required to incur a charge against earnings in an amount equal to any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances  net of any portion thereof that we estimate will be recoverable  through sale or otherwise  relating to any operation that is permanently shut down or has not generated or is not expected to generate sufficient cash flow  any pending acquisition that is not consummated  any landfill or development project that is not expected to be successfully completed  and any goodwill or other intangible assets that are determined to be impaired 
we have incurred such charges in the past 
our revenues and our operating income experience seasonal fluctuations 
our transfer and disposal revenues have historically been lower during the months of november through march 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of waste during the late fall  winter and early spring months primarily because the volume of waste relating to construction and demolition activities decreases substantially during the winter months in the northeastern united states  and decreased tourism in vermont  maine and eastern new york during the winter months tends to lower the volume of waste generated by commercial and restaurant customers  which is partially offset by increased volume from the winter ski industry 
since certain of our operating and fixed costs remain constant throughout the fiscal year  operating income is therefore impacted by a similar seasonality 
in addition  particularly harsh weather conditions typically result in increased operating costs to our operations 
our recycling business experiences increased volumes of newspaper in november and december due to increased newspaper advertising and retail activity during the holiday season 
our cellulose insulation joint venture experiences lower sales in november and december because of lower production of manufactured housing due to holiday plant shutdowns 
efforts by labor unions to organize our employees could divert management attention and increase our operating expenses 
labor unions regularly make attempts to organize our employees  and these efforts will likely continue in the future 
certain groups of our employees have chosen to be represented by unions  and we have negotiated collective bargaining agreements with these groups 
additional groups of employees may seek union representation in the future  and the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements could divert management attention and result in increased operating expenses and lower net income 
if we are unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements  we might have to wait through cooling off periods  which are often followed by union initiated work stoppages  including strikes 
depending on the type and duration of any labor disruptions  our revenues could decrease and our operating expenses could increase  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of july   approximately of our employees involved in collection  transfer  disposal  recycling or other operations  including our employees at our maine energy waste to energy facility  were represented by unions 
our class b common stock has ten votes per share and is held exclusively by john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella 
the holders of our class b common stock are entitled to ten votes per share and the holders of our class a common stock are entitled to one vote per share 
at july   an aggregate of  shares of our class b common stock  representing  votes  were outstanding  all of which were beneficially owned by john w 
casella  our chairman and chief executive officer  or by his brother  douglas r 
casella  a member of our board of directors 
based on the number of shares of common stock and series a redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding on july   the shares of our class a common stock and class b common stock beneficially owned by john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella represent approximately of the aggregate voting power of our stockholders 
consequently  john w 
casella and douglas r 
casella are able to substantially influence all matters for stockholder consideration  including exercising their influence over us according to interests that may differ from the interests of holders of the senior subordinated notes 
for instance  they may approve transactions that in their judgment enhance the value of their equity investment in us despite involving risks to holders of the notes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk 
at april   our outstanding variable rate debt consisted of the million term loan portion of our new senior secured credit facility 
if interest rates on this variable rate debt increased or decreased by basis points  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million 
in addition  the revolving credit facility portion of our new senior secured credit facility  as it may be outstanding from time to time  is variable rate debt 
the remainder of our debt is at fixed rates and not subject to interest rate risk 
on february   we entered into two interest rate swap agreements with two banks  effectively fixing the interest index rate on a notional million at approximately 
these hedges are specifically designated to existing interest payments under the term loan and are accounted for as effective cash flow hedges pursuant to sfas no 
the fair value of the swaps is estimated at a loss of million as of april  we are subject to commodity price fluctuations related to the portion of our sales of recyclable commodities that are not under floor or flat pricing arrangements 
as of april   to minimize our commodity exposure  we were party to twelve commodity hedging agreements 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
if commodity prices were to change by  the impact on our operating margin is estimated at million as of april   without considering our hedging agreements 
the effect of the hedge position would reduce the impact by approximately million 
on december   enron corporation enron  the counterparty for all of our commodity hedges as of that date  filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
as a result of the filing  we executed the early termination provisions provided under the forward contracts  and filed a claim with the bankruptcy court 
additionally  we agreed with our equity method investee  greenfiber  to include greenfiber in our claim as allowed under the applicable affiliate provisions 
we recorded a charge of million in fiscal other expense to recognize the change in fair value of our commodity contracts 
subsequent changes in the fair value of these commodity contracts were reflected in earnings until their march termination 
we have no remaining exposure related to our claims against enron
