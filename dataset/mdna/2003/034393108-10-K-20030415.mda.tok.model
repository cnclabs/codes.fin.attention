item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing we employ a sales staff as well as  from time to time  outside sales representative organizations to market our andrea anti noise products and our andrea dsp microphone and audio software products 
andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and audio software products are marketed to computer oems  distributors of personal computers and telecommunications equipment  software publishers  and end users in both business and household environments 
these products are sold to end users through distributors and value added resellers  software publishers  internet service providers and internet content developers 
under our existing collaborative agreements  our collaborators have various marketing and sales rights to our andrea anti noise and andrea dsp microphone and audio software products 
we are seeking to enter additional collaborative arrangements for marketing and selling our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and audio software products  but we cannot assure that we will be successful in these efforts 
market acceptance of the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and audio software products is critical to our success 
production operations we conduct low volume assembly operations at our new york and israeli facilities 
as sales of any particular product increase  assembly operations are transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
most of the components 
table of contents for the andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and audio software products are available from several sources and are not characteristically in short supply 
however  certain specialized components  such as microphones and dsp boards  are available from a limited number of suppliers and subject to long lead times 
to date we have been able to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  but we cannot assure that we will continue to be able to do so 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of these more specialized components could have a material adverse effect on our sales of andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and audio software products 
competition the markets for our andrea anti noise products and andrea dsp microphone and audio software products are highly competitive 
competition in these markets is based on varying combinations of product features  quality and reliability of performance  price  sales  marketing and technical support  ease of use  compatibility with evolving industry standards and other systems and equipment  name recognition  and development of new products and enhancements 
most of our current and potential competitors in these markets have significantly greater financial  marketing  technical  and other resources than us 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
we cannot assure that one or more of these competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
during  we incurred significant price pressure  as well as a significant decline in unit sales of andrea anti noise products to our oem customer base shipping continuous speech dictation products 
we attributed this decline to increasing competition as well as our ongoing strategic efforts to focus on being primarily a leading supplier of high end  digital based  far field microphone technologies 
in response to these factors  we exited from an increasingly unprofitable pc headset channel within the andrea anti noise headset product segment 
we believe that our ability to compete successfully will depend upon our capability to develop and maintain advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies and manufacture  assemble and market products  either alone or through third parties  in a profitable manner 
employees at december   we had employees  of whom were engaged in production and related operations  were engaged in research and development  and were engaged in management  administration  sales and customer support duties 
none of our employees are unionized or covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that we generally enjoy good relations with our employees 
on april   we sold our aircraft communications products division  as a result of such sale  we terminated approximately employees 
item properties andrea s corporate headquarters is located in melville  new york 
our corporate headquarters is located in approximately  square feet of leased space which houses our production operations  research and development activities  sales  administration and executive offices

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our mission is to provide the emerging voice interface markets with state of the art communications products that facilitate natural language  human machine interfaces 
examples of the applications and interfaces for which andrea dsp microphone and audio software products and andrea anti noise products provide benefit include internet and other computer based speech  telephony communications  multi point conferencing  speech recognition  multimedia  multi player internet and cd rom interactive games  and other applications and interfaces that incorporate natural language processing 
we believe that end users of these applications and interfaces will require high quality microphone and earphone products that enhance voice transmission  particularly in noisy environments  for use with personal computers  mobile personal computing devises  cellular and other wireless communication devices and automotive communication systems 
our andrea dsp microphone and audio software products use far field digital signal processing technology to provide high quality transmission of voice where the user is at a distance from the microphone 
high quality audio communication technologies will be required for emerging far field voice applications  ranging from continuous speech dictation  to internet telephony and multiparty video teleconferencing and collaboration  to natural language driven interfaces for automobiles  home and office automation and other machines and devices into which voice controlled microprocessors are expected to be introduced during the next several years 
we outsource high volume assembly of most of our andrea anti noise products from purchased components  and we are assembling low volume andrea dsp microphone and audio software products from purchased components primarily at our israeli facility 
as sales of any particular andrea dsp microphone and audio software product increases  assembly operations are transferred to a subcontractor in asia 
our critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
in addition to the recording and presentation of our convertible preferred stock  we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
revenue recognition non license related revenue is recognized upon shipment 
andrea reports such sales levels on a net sales basis  with net sales being computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual sales returns and the amount of reserves established for anticipated returns 
with respect to license revenues  andrea recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statement 
in addition  fee based services are performed on a time and material basis or on a fixed fee basis  under separate service arrangements 
we recognize license related revenues primarily based on an evaluation of the terms of individual contracts see note of our consolidated financial statements  for example considering  specifically  whether significant obligations remain  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fees are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 

table of contents accounts receivable we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
we evaluate specific accounts when we become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings or bankruptcy 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
our reserves also are determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories 
at december  and our allowance for doubtful accounts were approximately thousand and thousand respectively 
inventory we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make considerable judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with our current inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
we experienced significant inventory charges in due to our change in strategic direction resulting  in part  from declining market conditions 
in connection with our restructuring effort  we incurred inventory charges of approximately million during fiscal inventories of approximately million and million at december  and are net of reserves of approximately thousand and thousand  respectively 
it is possible that additional charges to inventory may occur in the future if there is further declines in market conditions  or if additional restructuring actions are taken 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas  no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
fas retains the fundamental provisions of fas for recognition and measurement of impairment  but amends the accounting and reporting standards for segments of a business to be disposed of 
the provisions of this statement require management judgments regarding the future operating and disposition plans for marginally performing assets  and estimates of expected realizable values for assets to be sold 
the impact of adopting this standard was not material to the financial statements 
sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
andrea has adopted this standard effective january   and  accordingly  those intangible assets that continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
the adoption of this pronouncement resulted in an approximate million decrease in amortization expense in other intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  continue to be amortized 
andrea has made an assessment of its intangible assets to identify goodwill separately from other identifiable intangibles 
andrea determined no adjustment was necessary  although the intangible asset workforce in place is reclassified as goodwill pursuant to fas we performed initial transitional impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets during the first six months of fiscal the impairment testing is performed in two steps step one the determination of impairment  based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying value  and step two if there is an impairment  this step measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
fas required that an entity complete step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test within six months of adoption  and that if there is an indication that the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  step two must be completed by the end of the fiscal year 
andrea completed its step two impairment testing during the fourth quarter of in accordance with fas with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm  relying primarily on discounted net cash flows for the respective 
table of contents respective business segment  and determined that the carrying amount of the andrea dsp microphone and audio software business segment exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with this new pronouncement and reduced goodwill to zero 
deferred tax assets we currently have significant deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes fas  requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
furthermore  fas provides that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  cumulative losses weigh heavily in the overall assessment 
accordingly  and after considering recent changes in existing positive evidence  we recorded a full valuation allowance  representing a charge of million  against our deferred tax assets during the third quarter in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets  or other significant positive evidence arises that suggests our ability to utilize such assets 
the future realization of a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options  if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but rather will result in an increase in additional paid in capital 
we will continue to re assess our reserves on deferred income tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis 
during  we recorded significant charges in connection with a restructuring program 
the related reserves established in that restructuring reflect various estimates  primarily those pertaining to inventory and settlements of contractual obligations 
we reassess the reserve requirements under our restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience may be different from our estimates used and  accordingly  additional charges related to our restructuring may be incurred 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of legal counsel 
the amount of any reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter 
the impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to revenue recognition  receivables and inventories is directly reflected in our segments income loss from operations 
although any charges related to our deferred tax assets are not reflected in our segment results  the long term forecasts supporting the realization of those assets and changes in them are significantly affected by the actual and expected results of each segment 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements certain information contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  and other items set forth in this report on form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the words anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans  seeks  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and certain assumptions made by our management 
investors are cautioned that matters subject to forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including economic  competitive  governmental  technological and other factors that may affect our business and prospects 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
in order to obtain the benefits of these safe harbor provisions for any such forward looking statements  we wish to caution investors and prospective investors about the following significant factors  which  among others  have in some cases affected our actual results and are in the future likely to affect our 
table of contents actual results and could cause them to differ materially from those expressed in any such forward looking statements 
these factors include because our operating results are subject to significant fluctuation  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indications of our future performance 
our results of operations have historically been and are subject to continued substantial annual and quarterly fluctuations 
the causes of these fluctuations include  among other things the volume of sales of our products under our collaborative marketing arrangements  the cost of development of our products  the mix of products we sell  the mix of distribution channels we use  the timing of our new product releases and those of our competitors  fluctuations in the computer and communications hardware and software marketplace  general economic conditions 
we cannot assure that the level of sales and gross profit  if any  that we achieve in any particular fiscal period will not be significantly lower than in other fiscal periods 
our revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million versus million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was approximately million  or per share on a diluted basis  versus net loss applicable to common shareholders of approximately million  or per share on a diluted basis and million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we continued to experience cash flow constraints and  in response  on april   we sold our aircraft communications products segment 
although we believe this sale will provide the company with necessary working capital  the aircraft communications products division generated approximately million in revenue  and total operating profit of approximately thousand for the year ended december  consequently  this sale is expected to result in a further decrease in sales during fiscal as compared to while we continue to explore opportunities to grow sales in other business areas  we are also examining additional opportunities for cost reduction  production efficiencies and further diversification of our business 
although we intend to continue improving cash flows by reducing overall expenses  we may not be able to easily and quickly implement such initiatives and  if our revenues continue to decline  our net income or loss may be disproportionately affected 
furthermore  our acquisition in of lamar signal processing  ltd 
lamar resulted in a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amortization of these intangible assets has had  and will continue to have  a negative  non cash impact on our results of operations other than goodwill 
in addition  at december  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to write off the goodwill associated with the lamar acquisition 
as a result of all the above factors  we expect to continue to accumulate losses and the market price of our common stock could decline 

table of contents if we fail to obtain additional capital or maintain access to funds sufficient to meet our operating needs  we may be required to significantly reduce  sell  or refocus  our operations and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely effected  and could result in our delisting on the american stock exchange or inability to continue operations 
in recent years  we have sustained significant operating losses 
we have been unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs and  correspondingly  from time to time during the past several years  we have raised additional capital from external sources 
we expect to continue to have to raise additional capital from external sources 
these sources may include private or public financings through the issuance of debt  convertible debt or equity  or collaborative arrangements 
such additional capital and funding may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
additionally  we may only be able to obtain additional capital or funds through arrangements that require us to relinquish rights to our products  technologies or potential markets  in whole or in part  or result in the sale of andrea 
additionally  andrea s funding and capital raising efforts could trigger change in control payments due to certain executive officers of andrea under their employment contracts  or redemptions of andrea s series b and series c redeemable convertible preferred stock 
on april   andrea sold its aircraft communications products segment for approximately million 
given our current financial condition and market conditions  it may be difficult to attract additional financings on favorable terms  or at all  as compared to prior periods 
we have revised our business strategies to reduce our expenses and capital expenditures  but we still do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining financings or access to additional sources of funding in amounts necessary to continue our operations 
failure to maintain sufficient access to funding may also result in our delisting from the american stock exchange 
we face the risk that andrea could be required to redeem the series b redeemable convertible preferred stock 
on june   andrea issued and sold in a private placement  of series b redeemable convertible preferred stock the series b preferred stock  and a warrant covering  shares of andrea s common stock 
each of the remaining shares of series b preferred stock par value per share  as of april   has a stated value of  plus dividends of per annum  which sum is convertible into common stock par value per share at a conversion price equal to the lower of the maximum conversion price and the average of the two lowest closing bid prices of the common stock during the consecutive trading days immediately preceding a conversion date the market price  subject to certain adjustments  including anti dilution 
the dividends may  at the option of andrea  be paid in cash 
the warrant has an exercise price of per share and expires on june  upon the announcement of a major transaction  as defined in andrea s certificate of incorporation  the investors have the right to require andrea to redeem all or a portion of the investor s preferred shares at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the stated value plus any accrued dividends or the market price on the day of announcement 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain triggering events  as defined  and depending on andrea s control over such events  the investors may have the right to require andrea to i redeem all or a portion of the preferred shares at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the stated value plus any accrued dividends or the market price on the day of announcement  or ii pay a penalty equal to of the remaining principal amount outstanding for a period not to exceed days in any day period  and adjust the maximum conversion price  as defined 
if we are forced to redeem the series b preferred stock  we would not have sufficient cash to satisfy the cost of redemption 
we face the risk that andrea could be required to redeem the series c redeemable convertible preferred stock 
table of contents on october   andrea issued and sold in a private placement  of series c redeemable convertible preferred stock the series c preferred stock 
the series c preferred stock is convertible or redeemable at maturity by andrea  based upon certain circumstances at that time  and is redeemable by the holder upon certain events  including the announcement of a major transaction  as defined in the certificate of amendment  or upon certain other triggering events 
in the first quarter of  a triggering event occurred and we obtained a waiver from the series c preferred stock holders of their redemption right 
a final agreement regarding the waiver arrangement was reached on march  the waiver related to the existing triggering event  as well as certain possible future triggering events  however  the waiver will be null and void upon the earlier of april   the first date on which andrea fails to comply in any material respect with the terms of the waiver and related documents  and the first date on which andrea is insolvent 
as consideration for the series c preferred stock holder s agreement to waive its current and  in certain circumstances  any future right to receive the aggregate triggering event redemption price for the series c preferred stock  andrea agreed to grant a security interest in all of andrea s assets 
however  the series c preferred stock holder agreed to have its lien on andrea s assets subordinated to any lien granted in the future to a non affiliated third party in connection with a strategic transaction with a financing component  provided that such third party lien relates only to the amount of the financing component of such transactions  and any lien granted in the future to a bank or other similar institution pursuant to any asset based financing transaction 
in addition  the series c preferred stock holder agreed to release its lien in connection with any sale of any assets subject to its lien  provided they receive a lien on the proceeds of the sale 
the series c preferred stock holder acknowledged that its lien in any portion of andrea s intellectual property is effectively subordinate to the interest of any current or future licensee of such intellectual property  as any interest the investor may have in such intellectual property cannot be greater than andrea s interest therein 
given that the waiver granted by the series c preferred stock holder does not cover all triggering events that could require the redemption of the series c preferred stock  and that the waiver will be null and void in the event andrea fails to comply in any material respect with the terms of the agreements relating to the waiver  among other things  there is a risk that the series c preferred stock holder could declare a triggering event that would trigger the redemption rights 
if such redemption rights are triggered and andrea has insufficient funds to satisfy the redemption  which would be the case if a redemption occurred at this time  andrea will be required to obtain a new waiver from the holder of the series c preferred stock 
if no such waiver can be obtained  andrea s ability to continue its current operations will be materially adversely affected and if andrea has insufficient funds to redeem the series c preferred stock  it could result in andrea s inability to meet its operating obligations and  consequently  delisting from the american stock exchange 
shares eligible for future sale may have an adverse effect on market price  you may experience substantial dilution 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could have the effect of depressing the prevailing market price of our common stock

conversions of our series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock may result in substantial dilution to other holders of our common stock 
as of april   we had shares of series b preferred stock and shares of series c preferred stock outstanding 
both the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock are convertible into shares of common stock  subject to ownership limitations that prohibit the holders of the preferred stock from owning more than of the outstanding shares of common stock at the time of conversion or over the sixty day period 
table of contents prior to the conversion 
these restrictions do not prevent purchasers from converting and selling some of their holdings and then later converting the rest of their holdings 
as the price of our common stock decreases  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock increases 
the variable conversion price of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock are functions of the market price of our common stock 
if the price of our common stock decreases over time  the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of each series will increase

if all of the outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock were converted on april   we would have issued a total of  shares of common stock 
if the market price of our common stock continues to decline  the conversion rates would increase  resulting in our issuing a greater number of shares upon conversion of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock sales of an increased number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock resulting from a declining market price for our common stock can cause the market price of our common stock to decline further 
disregarding the manner in which the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock are sold as well as any other factors such as reactions to our operating results and general market conditions which may be operative in the market at such time  an increase in the number of shares of common stock eligible for sale can cause a decrease in the market price of our common stock 
this decrease could reduce the conversion prices of the series b preferred stock and the series c preferred stock  leading to a further increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon future conversions and a further decline in our stock price 
short sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany conversions of series b preferred stock and series c preferred stock  which sales may cause downward pressure upon the price of our common stock 
short sales of our common stock may be attracted by or accompany the sale of converted common stock  which in the aggregate could cause downward pressure upon the price of the common stock  regardless of our operating results  thereby attracting additional short sales of the common stock 
the result of conversions of the series b and series c preferred stock at declining conversion prices would be increasing and substantial dilution of the interests of the other holders of common stock 

table of contents if we fail to market and commercialize our andrea dsp microphone and audio software products  or continue to develop andrea anti noise headset products  our revenues may not increase at a high enough rate to improve our results of operations or may not increase at all 
our business  results of operations and financial condition depend on the successful commercialization of our andrea dsp microphone and audio software products and technologies 
we introduced our first andrea dsp microphone products in and we continued to introduce complementary products and technologies over the last several years 
we are primarily targeting these products at the desktop computer market  the market for in vehicle computing and the audio and video conferencing markets  among others 
the success of these products is subject to the risks frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of product commercialization  particularly companies in the computing and communications industries 
since we began sales of our initial andrea anti noise headset products in  we have developed and introduced new products in this line 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we also restructured this business segment which resulted in a significant reduction in revenues 
if we are unable to obtain market acceptance of andrea dsp microphone and audio software products and technologies or if market acceptance of these products and technologies occurs at a slow rate  then our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we  and our competitors  are focused on developing and commercializing products and technologies that enhance the use of voice  particularly in noisy environments  for a broad range of computer and communications applications 
these products and technologies have been rapidly evolving and the number of our competitors has grown  but the markets for these products and technologies are subject to a high level of uncertainty and have been developing slowly 
we  alone or together with our industry  may be unsuccessful in obtaining market acceptance of these products and technologies 
if we fail to develop and successfully introduce new products and technologies in response to competition and evolving technology  we may not be able to attract new customers or retain current customers 
the markets in which we sell our andrea dsp microphone and audio software and andrea anti noise headset products are highly competitive 
we may not compete successfully with any of our competitors 
most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technology development  marketing  technical support and other resources than we do 
consequently  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  marketing  and sale of their products than we can 
one or more of these competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the introduction of products incorporating new technologies could render our products obsolete and unmarketable and could exert price pressures on existing products 
we are currently engaged in the development of digital signal processing products and technologies for the voice  speech and natural language interface markets 
we may not succeed in developing these new digital signal processing products and technologies  and any of these new digital signal processing products or technologies may not gain market acceptance further  the markets for our products and technologies are characterized by evolving industry and governmental standards and specifications that may require us to devote substantial time and expense to adapt our products and technologies 
for example  certain of our andrea dsp microphone and audio software and andrea anti noise headset products are subject to the federal communications commission fcc 
we may not successfully anticipate and adapt our products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner to changes in technology and industry standards or to introductions of new products and technologies by others that render our then existing products and technologies obsolete 

table of contents if our marketing collaborators do not effectively market those of their products with which our products are included or incorporated  our sales growth will be adversely affected 
we have entered into collaborative and distribution arrangements with software publishers and computer hardware manufacturers relating to the marketing and sale of andrea dsp microphone and audio software products through inclusion or incorporation with the products of our collaborators 
our success will therefore be dependent to a substantial degree on the efforts of these collaborators to market their products with which our products are included or incorporated 
our collaborators may not successfully market these products 
in addition  our collaborators generally are not contractually obligated to any minimum level of sales of our products or technologies  and we have no control over their marketing efforts 
furthermore  our collaborators may develop their own microphone  earphone or headset products that may replace our products or technologies or to which they may give higher priority 
shortages of  or interruptions in  the supply of more specialized components for our products could have a material adverse effect on our sales of these products 
we conduct low volume assembly operations at our facilities in new york and israel 
as sales of any particular product increases  assembly operations are transferred to subcontractors primarily in the far east using purchased components 
some specialized components for the andrea anti noise headset and andrea dsp microphone products  such as microphones and digital signal processing boards are available from a limited number of suppliers in some cases foreign and subject to long lead times 
we may not be able to continue to obtain sufficient supplies of these more specialized components  particularly if the sales of our products increase substantially or market demand for these components otherwise increases 
if our subcontractors fail to meet our production and shipment schedules  our business  results of operations and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to compete may be limited by our failure to adequately protect our intellectual property or by patents granted to third parties 
we rely on a combination of patents  patent applications  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks  nondisclosure agreements with our employees  licensees and potential licensees  limited access to and dissemination of our proprietary information  and other measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights 
however  the steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent its misappropriation or circumvention 
in addition  numerous patents have been granted to other parties in the fields of noise cancellation  noise reduction  computer voice recognition  digital signal processing and related subject matter 
we expect that products in these fields will increasingly be subject to claims under these patents as the numbers of products and competitors in these fields grow and the functionality of products overlap 
claims of this type could have an adverse effect on our ability to manufacture and market our products or to develop new products and technologies  because the parties holding these patents may refuse to grant licenses or only grant licenses with onerous royalty requirements 
moreover  the laws of other countries do not protect our proprietary rights to our technologies to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
an unfavorable ruling in any current litigation proceeding or future proceeding may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
from time to time we are subject to litigation incidental to our business 
for example  we are subject to the risk of adverse claims  interference proceedings before the us patent and trademark office  oppositions to patent applications outside the united states  and litigation alleging infringement of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation to establish the validity of patents  to assert infringement claims against others  and to defend against patent infringement claims can be expensive and time consuming  even if the outcome is in our favor 

table of contents changes in economic and political conditions outside the united states could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we generate sales to regions outside the united states  particularly in europe and areas in the americas and asia 
for the years ended december   and  sales to customers outside the united states accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our net sales 
international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks  including trade restrictions in the form of license requirements  restrictions on exports and imports and other government controls  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  problems in establishing and managing distributor relationships  general economic conditions  and political and economic instability or conflict 
to date  we have invoiced our international sales in us dollars  and have not engaged in any foreign exchange or hedging transactions 
we may not continue to be able to invoice all of our sales in us dollars and to avoid engaging in foreign exchange or hedging transactions 
if we are required to invoice any material amount of international sales in non us currencies  fluctuations in the value of non us currencies relative to the non us dollar may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition or require us to incur hedging costs to counter such fluctuations 
we face risk from operating in israel 
our principal research and development facility is located in the state of israel and  as a result  certain of our key research and development employees are located in israel 
although substantially all of our sales currently are being made to customers outside israel  we are nonetheless directly influenced by the political  economic and military conditions affecting israel 
since the establishment of the state of israel in  a state of hostility has existed  varying in degree and intensity  between israel and arab countries 
although israel has entered into various agreements with certain arab countries and the palestinian authority  and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the middle east  we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved 
if we are unable to attract and retain the necessary managerial  technical and other personnel necessary for our business  then our business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of these executive officers or key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managers and technical personnel 
as of the date of this filing  the board of directors of andrea electronics is in the process of negotiating contracts with each of douglas j 
andrea  chairman of the board of directors  christopher p 
sauvigne  president and chief executive officer  joseph marash  chief technology officer  richard a 
maue  chief financial officer and thomas w 
mcclay  general counsel 
competition for qualified personnel is intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain qualified personnel in the future 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales 
table of contents sales for the year ended december   were  a decrease of from sales of  for the year ended december  this decrease in sales reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise products to  or of total sales  an approximate decrease in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales  partially offset by an approximate increase in sales of andrea dsp microphone and audio software products  to  or of total sales 
the primary reason for the decreases in sales of andrea anti noise headset product is substantially due to our decision  during the fourth quarter  to exit from an unprofitable  pc oem retail headset channel within andrea s anti noise headset product segment 
this customer channel included ibm  and for the year ended december   sales to ibm and certain of ibm s affiliates accounted for approximately of our total sales  or  this reflects an approximate decrease from  for the year ended december  the decreases in our aircraft communications product revenues is primarily a result of a decrease in us department of defense funding which affected programs where andrea s products are used  primarily during the second and third quarters of fiscal on april   the company sold its aircraft communications products segment 
sales of such products during  and approximated  and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
as a result  this sale is expected to result in a further decrease in sales during fiscal the increases in sales of andrea dsp microphone and audio software products is primarily due to licensing revenue recognized during related to our agreements with analog devices 
the unamortized portion of the same license agreements is recorded as deferred revenue  of which is classified as current and  is classified as long term as of december  all license revenues are being recognized on a straight line basis over three years  million of which started to be recognized during the first quarter of  and million which started in the third quarter of cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  decreased to from for the year ended december   before restructuring charges 
this decrease primarily reflects the significant restructuring charge recorded during the fourth quarter of coupled with  to a lessor extent  the impact of the significant changes in the composition of our revenues as described under sales above  in particular  the significant increase in high margin license revenues associated with our agreements with analog devices primarily attributable to the third and fourth quarters  and the elimination of sales of low margin andrea anti noise headset products associated with the aforementioned restructuring activity 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the year ending december  the substantial amount of research and development is a reflection of our efforts to develop and commercialize dsp microphone and audio technologies  coupled with  to a lesser extent  efforts in aircraft communication product technologies and andrea anti noise headset products 
for  the andrea dsp microphone and audio software technology efforts were  or of total research and development expenses  aircraft communications technology efforts were  or of total research and development expenses and andrea anti noise headset product efforts were  or of total research and development expenses 
with respect to dsp microphone and audio software technologies  research efforts are primarily focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language driven human machine interface by developing optimal far field microphone solutions for various voice driven interfaces  incorporating andrea s digital super directional array microphone technology dsda  and certain other related technologies such as noise suppression and stereo acoustic echo cancellation 
we believe that continued research and development spending should provide andrea with a competitive advantage  however  as part of our overall effort to conserve cash  we intend to reduce the relatively high levels of such expenses during fiscal general  administrative and selling expenses 
table of contents general  administrative and selling expenses decreased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  these decreases are primarily due to cost reduction efforts  as well as our adoption  on january   of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
under fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment from time to time 
the adoption of this pronouncement resulted in a decrease of  in amortization expense for when compared to the prior year 
as a result of the sale of the aircraft communications products segment  as well as our overall effort to conserve cash  we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses will decline substantially during other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease is due to lower cash balances coupled with unfavorable market conditions for those invested cash balances during provision for income taxes we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets during  recognizing a  non cash charge to provision for income taxes 
in addition  we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to utilize the assets  or other significant positive evidence arises that suggests our ability to utilize such assets 
the future realization of a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options  if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but rather will result in an increase in additional paid in capital 
we will continue to re assess our reserves on deferred income tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  principally reflects the factors described above 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  and in accordance with fas  the company completed its transitional impartment testing of the carrying value of its goodwill 
as the carrying value of the goodwill was determined to exceed the fair value  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with this new pronouncement and reduced goodwill to zero 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  sales excluding the impact of restructuring charges  sales for the year ended december   were  a decrease of from sales of  for the year ended december  this decrease in sales reflects an approximate decrease in sales of andrea anti noise products to  or of total sales  offset by an approximate increase in sales of our aircraft communications products  to  or of total sales  and an approximate increase in sales of andrea dsp microphone and audio software products  to  or of total sales 
the primary reason for the decrease of andrea anti noise product sales during was a significant decline in headset unit shipments to ibm which was primarily a result of increased competition in the pc headset market  coupled with unfavorable economic conditions which continues to negatively impact the technology sector 
in response  during the fourth quarter  we formulated a plan to exit from an increasingly unprofitable pc headset channel within andrea s anti noise headset product segment 
this customer channel included ibm 
for the year ended december   sales to ibm and certain of ibm s 
table of contents affiliates accounted for approximately of our total sales  or  this reflects an approximate decrease from  for the year ended december  the increase in our aircraft communication product revenues is primarily a result of increased sales and marketing activities 
sales of andrea dsp microphone and audio software products were primarily comprised of shipments of andrea s far field microphone products for use with business videoconferencing systems  in vehicle communications systems  and desktop speech dictation applications 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded deferred revenues of million related to a license agreement for certain of our andrea dsp microphone and audio software technologies 
the deferred revenue will be recognized over a period of three years beginning march  cost of sales excluding the impact of restructuring charges  cost of sales as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  remained consistent from the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased to  from  for the year ending december  this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in expenses associated with research efforts that were determined not to be integral to andrea s core portfolio of digital microphone software and hardware technologies 
dsp microphone and software technology efforts were  or of total research and development expenses  aircraft communications technology efforts were  or of total research and development expenses and andrea anti noise product efforts were  or of total research and development expenses 
with respect to dsp microphone and software technologies  research efforts are primarily focused on the pursuit of commercializing a natural language driven human machine interface by developing optimal far field microphone solutions for various voice driven interfaces  incorporating our digital super directional array microphone technology dsda and certain other related technologies obtained through the acquisition of lamar in may we believe that the acquisition of lamar significantly reinforces its position in digital signal processing by extending our marketing programs to other high growth industries  including automotive telematics  mobile device markets  the business videoconferencing market and internet telephony  among others 
specifically  the core technology acquired produces noise filtering capabilities that management believes is preferred to other known dsp based technologies in the market  and is unattainable in products using traditional mechanical solutions 
in addition  the nature of a dsp based solution  together with the people acquired supporting our technology  offers a solution that is highly scalable and embeddable  and therefore enables the technology to be integrated into many different applications and form factors 
we believe that continued research and development spending will provide us with a competitive advantage 
general  administrative and selling expenses excluding the impact of restructuring charges  general  administrative and selling expenses decreased approximately to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due to our cost reduction efforts which are aimed at cutting costs that are not integral to the execution of andrea s overall strategy  and to ensure conservative spending during the current period of economic uncertainty 
included in our cost reduction initiatives was a reduction in workforce which was implemented during february of  representing a reduction of approximately of andrea s then total workforce 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter  we committed to a defined plan of action and recorded restructuring charges relating to repositioning our business plan for our anti noise product business segment as part of our overall effort to drive high margin product sales and become profitable 
the restructuring focused on exiting from an increasingly unprofitable pc headset channel within andrea s anti noise headset product segment 
this was primarily a result of 
table of contents the increasing competitive nature of the pc headset market  coupled with andrea s ongoing strategic efforts to focus on being primarily a leading supplier of high end  digital based  far field microphone technologies 
this channel primarily purchased our lower end  low margin headset products  and required substantial support which  when combined with decreasing volumes realized during  became unprofitable 
the plan resulted in an aggregate restructuring charge of approximately million  and included the following sales returns restructuring reserve this charge  approximating thousand  reflects estimated sales returns activity related to exiting this customer channel 
cost of sales this charge  approximating million  relates to inventory obsolescence for products that we do not expect to sell as a result of exiting this activity 
other charges these charges  approximating million  relate to costs associated with exiting certain agreements  as well as impairment charges associated with abandoning related assets 
other income expense other income for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  this decrease is due to lower cash balances coupled with unfavorable market conditions for those invested cash balances during provision for income taxes we did not record income tax expense for the year ending december  in light of the net loss recorded for the period 
furthermore  the realization of a portion of our reserved deferred tax assets  if and when realized  will not result in a tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations  but will result in an increase in additional paid in capital as they are related to tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options 
we will be continually re assessing its reserves on deferred income tax assets in future periods on a quarterly basis 
the determination as to the realization of additional reserves is  and will be  based on andrea s expectations of future earnings 
to the extent we believe that  more likely than not  previously reserved deferred tax assets will be realized  we will reduce the reserve accordingly 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  was  compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  the net loss for the year ended december  principally reflects the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources andrea s principal sources of funds have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  gross cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of convertible notes  preferred stock or other securities to certain financial institutions and potential industry partners 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  compared with  at december  the balance of cash and cash equivalents at december   is primarily a result of our license transactions with analog devices  together with gross cash flows from operations 
working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  the decrease in working capital reflects decrease in total current assets of  and an increase in total current liabilities of  the decrease in total current assets reflects decreases in cash and cash equivalents of  a decrease in accounts receivable of  such decrease is primarily a result of our collection of license fees from analog devices  a decrease in inventory of  and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of  the increase in total current liabilities reflects a decrease in trade accounts payable of  a decrease in current portion of long term debt of  a decrease of  in 
table of contents accrued restructuring charges  an increase of  in deferred revenue a result of our license fees from analog devices and an increase of  in other current liabilities 
the decrease in cash of  reflects  of net cash provided by operating activities   of net cash used in investing activities and  of net cash used in financing activities 
the cash provided by operating activities  excluding non cash charges  is primarily attributable to the  net loss for the year ended december   a  decrease in accounts receivable  a  decrease in inventory  a  decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets  a  decrease increase in other assets  a  decrease in accounts payables  a  increase in other current and other liabilities  a  decrease in accrued restructuring charges and a  increase in deferred revenue 
the change in accounts receivable and change in deferred revenue primarily reflects the impact of our license agreements with analog devices 
the changes in inventory  accounts payable and other current and long term liabilities primarily reflect differences in the timing related to both the payments for and the acquisition of raw materials as well as for other services in connection with ongoing efforts related to andrea s various product lines 
the cash used in investing activities reflects an increase in property and equipment of  and an increase in patents and trademarks of  the increase in property and equipment primarily relates to capital expenditures related to manufacturing dies for our andrea anti noise headset business line and our andrea dsp microphone and audio software business line 
the increase in patents and trademarks reflects capital expenditures associated with intellectual property related to our andrea dsp microphone and audio software business line 
the net cash used in financing activities reflects payments related to the debt we assumed in connection with the acquisition of lamar 
we believe that it will be necessary to raise additional working capital to support operations 
in recent years  we have sustained significant operating losses and we have been unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs 
correspondingly  from time to time during the past several years  we raised capital from external sources 
in december  april  august and june  andrea raised working capital through the issuance of convertible subordinated debentures 
in june  andrea raised million through the issuance and sale of series b preferred stock 
in october  andrea raised million through the issuance and sale of series c preferred stock 
during  we continued to explore different sources of external funding in amounts necessary to continue our operations  while pursuing opportunities in our andrea dsp microphone and audio software products segment and our andrea anti noise products segment 
as a result of our efforts  on april   we sold our aircraft communications products division for approximately million 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we received million in cash with the balance of the purchase price payable in equal installments over the succeeding eleven month period 
in addition to the proceeds resulting from the sale of the aircraft communications products segment  we plan to continue to improve our cash flows during by continuing to implement reductions of administrative overhead expenses where necessary and feasible as well as aggressively pursue existing and prospective opportunities to sell our superbeam array microphone generated through our co marketing efforts with analog devices in the personal computing market  existing opportunities in the automotive in vehicle computing market  opportunities in the video and audio conferencing market and opportunities in the call center market 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully execute the aforementioned plans 
as of april   upon receipt of the million from the sale of the aircraft communications products division  andrea has approximately million unaudited of cash 
during  we burned million in cash  excluding the million in cash generated from the license agreements with analog devices 
we expect our burn rate to decrease as a result of planned reductions of certain administrative  overhead and research and development expenses that are expected to begin during the second quarter of  partially offset by the elimination of positive net cash flows from the aircraft communications products division 
as a result  we believe that we have sufficient liquidity available to continue in operation through at least december however  to the extent the company does not experience growth from its remaining business segments  additional liquidity will be required in early accordingly  if we fail to develop additional revenues from sales of our products to generate adequate funding from operations  or if we fail to obtain additional financing through a capital transaction or other type of funding  we will be required to continue significantly reducing our operating expenses and or operations or we may have to relinquish our products  technologies or markets 
we have no commitment for additional financing  and may experience difficulty in obtaining additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock and may dilute our current shareholders ownership interest in andrea 
we cannot assure that demand will continue for any of our products  including future products related to our andrea dsp microphone and audio 
table of contents software technologies  or  that if such demand does exist  that we will be able to obtain the necessary working capital to increase production and marketing resources to meet such demand on favorable terms  or at all

 goodwill and other intangible assets fas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under fas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
andrea has adopted this standard effective january   and  accordingly  those intangible assets that continue to be classified as goodwill or as other intangibles with indefinite lives are no longer amortized 
the adoption of this pronouncement  resulted in an approximately million decrease in amortization expense in other intangible assets  which do not have indefinite lives  continue to be amortized 
andrea has made an assessment of its intangible assets to identify goodwill separately from other identifiable intangibles 
andrea determined no adjustment was necessary  although the intangible asset workforce in place is reclassified as goodwill pursuant to fas we performed initial transitional impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets during the first six months of fiscal the impairment testing is performed in two steps step one the determination of impairment  based upon the fair value of a reporting unit as compared to its carrying value  and step two if there is an impairment  this step measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
fas required that an entity complete step one of the transitional goodwill impairment test within six months of adoption  and that if there is an indication that the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  step two must be completed by the end of the fiscal year 
andrea completed its step two impairment testing during the fourth quarter of in accordance with fas with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm  relying primarily on discounted net cash flows for the respective business segment  and determined that the carrying amount of the andrea dsp microphone and audio software business segment exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with this new pronouncement and reduced goodwill to zero

fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  andrea does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal source of financing activities is the issuance of convertible debt with financial institutions 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through any amounts payable in stock  or cash by us under convertible securities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge against changes in interest rates or for any other purpose 
in addition  substantially all transactions by us are denominated in us dollars 
as such  we have shifted foreign currency exposure onto our foreign customers 
as a result  if exchange rates move against foreign customers  we could experience difficulty collecting unsecured accounts receivable  the cancellation of existing orders or the loss of future orders 
the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations
