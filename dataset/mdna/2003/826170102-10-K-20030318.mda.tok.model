overview of results throughout much of  the global economy was in the midst of a downward course that was so pronounced that many economists believed that several countries  most notably the united states  japan and germany  had slipped toward a recession 
while the global economy declined during much of  there were indications in the fourth quarter of and the first part of the first quarter of that an end to the economic slow down appeared to be forthcoming 
throughout much of the economic data did indeed appear to indicate that macroeconomic conditions were stabilizing  however  capital spending by corporations  and more specifically information technology spending  appears to be lagging behind the overall economic recovery 
specifically  according to industry reports  worldwide spending by corporations on information technology as a percentage of the surveyed companies total revenues decreased by during and in terms of absolute dollars it decreased by approximately 
this compared to no growth in terms of absolute dollars of worldwide information technology spending in and growth in while there are undoubtedly numerous reasons for the lag in corporate information technology spending  the company believes that the primary reason for the decrease in information technology spending relates to corporations intensifying their efforts to identify and realize potential cost savings in these difficult economic circumstances 
in addition  in the years preceding and  many corporations made capital expenditures in anticipation of future growth that did not materialize  thereby impacting their capital expenditures in and the geopolitical uncertainties and investors concern regarding corporate governance have only exacerbated corporations general cautiousness in setting their capital spending budgets 
the company s operations and financial performance during were impacted by these economic conditions and uncertainties and the resulting decrease in information technology spending 
specifically  the company s revenue growth and profitability depend in large part on the overall global economic and business conditions  business and consumer confidence in the economy  and the demand for information technology  particularly within the markets in which the company offers industry specific versions of its products 
many of the company s customers and potential customers have i delayed the initiation of the purchasing process  ii increased the evaluation time to complete a software purchase  and or iii reduced their capital expenditure budgets  thereby restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
increased competition in the market for the company s products has also contributed to these changes and lead to a more volatile purchasing cycle for the company s software applications 
as a result of these factors  both the number of software license revenue transactions and average transaction size were negatively impacted during  with individual transactions generating license revenues greater than million affected to the greatest extent 
despite these difficult economic challenges  the company was able to improve many of its key operating metrics  as discussed further below  resize its operations to better align its costs with anticipated revenues  and continue its ongoing technological leadership through increased investment in product development and the release in the second half of of siebel and uan  a standards based  vendor independent application integration solution 
the company proactively addressed the challenging economic conditions by setting five broad objectives at the beginning of  which guided management s decisions i operate a cash positive  profitable business  ii maintain and improve customer satisfaction levels  iii maintain and improve the company s market leadership  iv maintain the company s product leadership in ebusiness applications software  and v continue to develop solutions for the company s customers that lower the total cost of integrating software applications 
to better enable the company to effectively achieve these five objectives  management undertook the following actions during the company completed a restructuring of its operations in order to better align the company s cost structure with its anticipated future revenues 
the company believes that the restructuring will reduce its future operating costs and related cash requirements  thereby strengthening the company s future operating performance 
please refer to restructuring below and to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an explanation and further discussion of the restructuring 
the company repurchased million employee stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share on september  the company repurchased these options in order to i improve employee morale by realigning the cash and equity components of its compensation programs  ii eliminate the distraction to its employees of significantly out of the money stock options  and iii reduce the number of outstanding stock options relative to the number of shares outstanding  or option overhang  thereby reducing future potential dilution to existing stockholders 
please refer to option repurchase below and to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an explanation and further discussion of the repurchase of these stock options 
the company maintained the cost controls that it initiated in and  accordingly  reduced the discretionary portion of its cost structure to near minimal levels during specifically  management continued to reduce advertising expenditures  maintained the chief executive officer salary at one dollar per year  maintained the previously established reductions in senior executive compensation  reduced bonuses for all employees  including officers  deferred merit increases until the third quarter of  and reduced discretionary expenditures  such as travel and recruiting 
the company continued its requirement of obtaining competitive bids for its purchases  where appropriate  and required chief executive officer approval for all significant purchases 
to ensure that the company maintains continuity of business operations under adverse circumstances  including a significant geopolitical dislocation or earthquake in the san francisco bay area  the company continued to strengthen its data communications and customer service infrastructure 
in october  the company completed a redundant backup information technology infrastructure site in salt lake city  utah  thereby strengthening its ability to provide high quality customer service globally even in the event of a significant and sustained system outage at any of the company s facilities 
the company continued its focus on customer satisfaction by leading a team of systems integrators and software vendors in a collaborative effort to reduce the cost of integrating software applications 
through this collaborative effort  the company released uan in the fourth quarter of uan is designed to address one of the primary challenges currently facing the software applications industry driving down the cost of application ownership and maintenance 
as a result of these actions  the company believes it was able to maintain its high customer satisfaction levels  maintain its market share in the majority of the product categories in which it operates  continue as a technology leader in the customer relationship management market  and continue its efforts to lower the total cost to its customers of integrating software applications 
in addition  information technology surveys indicate customer relationship management software is among the top spending priorities of corporations and  accordingly  the company believes it is well positioned for future growth when information technology spending returns to normalized levels 
excluding the costs relating to the restructuring and option repurchase  the company was able to operate a cash positive  profitable business in exceptionally challenging economic times 
in addition  the company achieved the following financial results total expenses  excluding the cost of the restructuring and the option repurchase  decreased by  from  million in to  million in cash and short term investments increased by million  or  from  million as of december   to  million as of december   representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
during the periods of deteriorating global economic conditions of and  the company increased cash and short term investments by  million  or  primarily through cash flows from operations 
days sales outstanding decreased from days and days as of december  and  respectively  to days as of december  cash flows from operations were million and million during and  respectively 
working capital increased by  from  million as of december   to  million as of december  deferred revenue  which consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue  increased by  from million as of december   to million as of december  stockholders equity increased by  from  million as of december   to  million as of december  as a result of current economic uncertainties and concerns regarding the accounting practices of publicly traded companies  the company believes that three specific factors will increasingly become important measures of a company s overall performance and value i positive cash flows from operations  ii positive earnings that are reported in accordance with both the form and the intent of generally accepted accounting principles  and iii a strong balance sheet 
since shipment of its first product in the fourth quarter of  the company s operations have produced positive annual cash flows 
excluding the impact of the restructuring and the option repurchase  the company s operations have also produced positive annual earnings during this period 
the company believes that its financial position is strong  with total assets of  million  cash and short term investments of  million  working capital of  million and stockholders equity of  million 
the company believes the above actions will better enable the company to return to positive revenue growth and improved operating performance 
as the company begins  management has developed additional goals that  if accomplished  will further strengthen the company s financial position and build on the actions initiated by management during these broad objectives include increase software license revenue from the company s core customer relationship management products and verticals  continue to increase market share and software license revenues in the company s newest product lines uan  siebel erm  and siebel analytics  increase the company s customer base in key vertical markets  such as life sciences  public sector  retail  and travel and transportation  identify opportunities to expand product lines  both organically and through acquisition  improve the execution within the company s sales organization  grow professional services  maintenance and other revenues  commence new cost control initiatives to further reduce total cost per employee  and expand operating margins 
the company is committed to pursuing these objectives and building on the initiatives undertaken during  thereby allowing the company to return to positive revenue growth and to expand its operating margins 
in addition  the company will continue to follow its high professional standards in measuring and reporting its performance against these objectives 
the company believes that the application of accounting standards and the related disclosures in the public filings with the securities and exchange commission are as important as a company s reported financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
the company believes that its accounting policies are prudent and provide a clear view of the company s financial performance 
the company utilizes its internal audit function to help ensure that it follows these accounting policies and maintains its internal controls 
the company has formed a disclosure committee  composed primarily of senior financial and legal personnel  to help ensure the completeness and accuracy of the company s financial results and disclosures 
in addition  prior to the release of the company s financial results  key members of the company s management review the company s annual and quarterly results and key accounting policies and estimates with its audit committee  which is composed of independent members of the company s board of directors 
restructuring as discussed above  throughout and the company reduced the discretionary portion of its operating costs to near minimal levels 
as a result of the continued downturn in the information technology industry during  certain of the company s key operating metrics  such as total revenue  operating margin and revenue per employee  continued to decline from the company s historical levels 
in response to this decline  the company announced a planned restructuring of its operations in july  which was completed in december the restructuring was intended to i strengthen the company s competitive position  and ii reduce its cost structure and thereby improve the company s revenue per employee  operating margin and overall operating performance 
the company recognized a total charge related to this restructuring of million  of which the company recognized million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of the restructuring charge is comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of the company s workforce  ii lease termination costs and other costs associated with permanently vacating certain facilities  and iii impairment costs related to certain long lived assets that were abandoned in connection with the company s consolidation of its facilities 
as part of the restructuring  the company reduced its workforce by a total of approximately  employees  or 
this workforce reduction affected substantially all of the company s organizations and geographical regions 
the costs associated with the company s workforce reduction consist primarily of severance  cobra benefits  payroll taxes and other associated employment termination costs 
as a result of the workforce reduction and previous employee attrition  certain of the company s facilities were under utilized and certain facilities that were scheduled to be occupied in early were expected to be under utilized 
accordingly  during the third and fourth quarters of  the company consolidated its workforce into existing facilities  thereby permanently removing from its operations certain facilities then occupied and facilities that the company does not plan to occupy 
the facilities permanently removed from the company s operations were primarily located in emeryville and san mateo  california  egham  england  and several smaller offices in north america and europe 
the costs associated with the company s facilities consolidation primarily relate to lease termination costs  costs associated with satisfying remaining lease commitments  and expected brokerage and other re letting costs  partially offset by estimated sublease income 
the company is in the process of negotiating with its lessors appropriate lease termination fees and or seeking suitable subtenants of these facilities 
the company s estimates of the excess facilities charge may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors which may be beyond the company s control  such as the company s success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to the facilities reserve will be made if further consolidations are required or if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
as part of the consolidation of the company s facilities  certain leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures were abandoned in the third and fourth quarters of as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge equal to the net book value of these abandoned long lived assets in restructuring related expenses 
subject to the timely and successful implementation of the restructuring  the company believes that the restructuring will further reduce the company s expense levels and a portion of the related cash requirements  resulting in a cost structure that is better aligned with the company s anticipated future revenues 
specifically  the company expects the implementation of the restructuring to reduce the company s quarterly operating expenses by approximately million from the levels where operating expenses would have been absent the restructuring 
the majority of the quarterly operating expense savings are expected to be derived from reductions of compensation and benefits totaling approximately million  with the remaining savings being derived from reductions of facility related expenses totaling approximately million  which includes depreciation expense of million related to abandoned leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures 
in addition  as the result of removing certain facilities from the company s operations that were scheduled to be occupied in the first quarter of  the company will avoid up to an additional million in quarterly expenses 
these expense savings and avoidance amounts are prior to expenses that may increase  such as bonuses  commissions and advertising  among others 
the company expects to achieve these expense savings by the end of the first quarter of because the restructuring charge and related benefits are derived from management s estimates  which are based on currently available information  the restructuring may not achieve the benefits currently anticipated or on the timetable or at the level currently contemplated 
in addition  the company s software license revenues and operating performance may continue to be negatively impacted by i the uncertainty in the information technology industry and associated reductions in capital expenditures  ii geopolitical uncertainties  iii additional terrorist attacks  iv a lack of confidence in corporate governance and accounting practices  v the diversity in global economic conditions  vi continued intense competition  vii corporate and consumer confidence in the economy  evidenced  in part  by stock market levels  and viii other factors described under risk factors below 
accordingly  additional actions  including a further restructuring of the company s operations  may be required in the future 
as a result  the demand for the company s products and services and  ultimately  the company s future financial performance  are difficult to predict with any degree of certainty 
please refer to we may not be able to successfully implement our restructuring efforts  and such efforts may adversely impact our ability to retain and attract future employees under risk factors for further discussion of risks associated with the restructuring

stock options to purchase an aggregate of million shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the option repurchase 
members of the company s board of directors were excluded from the option repurchase and  accordingly two individuals  the company s chairman and ceo and its vice chairman  co founder and vice president  strategic planning did not participate 
the company also excluded employees on a leave of absence other than for medical  maternity  military  workers compensation or other statutorily protected reasons and employees who submitted a letter of resignation or received notice of termination prior to the termination of the offer period 
eligible employees who participated in the option repurchase received  in exchange for the repurchase of tendered stock options  a fixed amount of consideration equal to the number of common shares underlying such tendered stock options  multiplied by 
in accordance with terms of the option repurchase  employees who were due total consideration of  or less received the consideration less applicable tax withholdings in cash  and employees who were due more than  received the consideration less applicable tax withholdings in fully vested  non forfeitable shares of the company s common stock  which are subject to certain holding periods as described below

the number of fully vested  non forfeitable shares of the company s common stock issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due less the amount of applicable tax withholdings by the closing price of the company s common stock on september   of per share 
the company recorded a compensation charge of million related to the option repurchase  consisting of million related to the consideration paid and million of associated employer payroll taxes and other costs 
the company has allocated this expense to the respective categories within the accompanying consolidated statement of operations based on the individual option holder s functional responsibility

software license revenues decreased by from  million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   and decreased an additional t o million for the year ended december  software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the company s customers include several of its suppliers and on occasion  the company has purchased goods or services for the company s operations from these vendors at or about the same time the company has license d its software to these same organizations a concurrent transaction 
software license transactions that occur within six months ie  at or about the same time of a purchase by the company from that same customer are reviewed by management for appropriate accounting and disclosure 
the company accounts for concurrent transactions in accordance with apb no 
accounting for nonmonetary transactions and eitf no 
interpretations of apb opinion  collectively referred to as apb concurrent transactions are separately negotiated  settled in cash  and recorded at terms the company considers to be arm s length 
in addition  the company receives competitive bids for the goods or services purchased by the company in connection with concurrent transactions and these goods or services were budgeted by the company in advance of the transaction  where appropriate 
prior to recognizing any revenue from a concurrent transaction  the company ensures that i the transaction meets its standard revenue recognition policies  as discussed above  ii the customer meets the company s standard credit requirements  iii the transaction represents the culmination of the earnings process  and iv all goods or services purchased b y the company are necessary for its current operations and are expected to be placed into service shortly after purchase 
if the concurrent transaction meet s these requirements  the company records the revenue at fair value  as defined b y apb the company determines fair value based on a comparison of cash transactions for its software that are of similar size and on similar terms as the concurrent transaction or the fair value of the goods or services purchased by the company  whichever is more readily determinable 
during  and  the company recognized million  million and million  respectively  of software license revenues from concurrent transactions 
the company did not have any concurrent transactions during the third and fourth quarters of during and  the company s customers were impacted by i the overall weakness of the global economy  ii continued reductions in corporate capital expenditures  iii geopolitical uncertainties  and iv operational execution  among many other factors 
accordingly  many of the company s customers and potential customers have i delayed the initiatio n of the purchasing process  ii increased the evaluation time to complete a software purchase  and or iii reduced their capital expenditure budgets  thereby restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
in addition  the length of the purchasing cycle for the company s software applications has increased slightly as the result of increased competition 
as a result of these factors  both the number of software license revenue transactions and average transaction size were negatively impacted during  with individual transactions generating software license revenues greater than million affected to the greatest extent 
specifically the average transaction size has decreased in each of the last two years from  in  to  in and  in in addition  the number of transactions generating software license revenues greater than million has decreased from transactions in and transactions in  to transactions in consequently  the company s software license revenues also decreased in and the decline in software license revenues as a percentage of total revenues in both and was primarily due to the factors described above impacting software license revenues to a greater extent than professional services  maintenance and other revenues 
the company markets its products through its direct sales force and to a limited extent through distributors  primarily in europe  asia pacific  japan and latin america 
international license revenues accounted for  and of software license revenues in  and  respectively 
the company expects international software license revenues will continue to account for a significant portion of its overall software license revenues in the future 
the company and its management are committed to improving the performance of its sales organization and returning the company s software license revenues to positive sequential quarterly growth 
although the company s software license revenues decreased on a year over year basis during  the company was able to take several steps in that it believes will better position it for future growth 
specifically  the company reorganized it s sales management in the fourth quarter  including the hiring of a new senior vice president  worldwide sales  in order to improve the sales organization s performance 
in addition  the company continued to increase its customer base with more than of software license revenues coming from new customer projects during the company believes that the continued growth of its customer base will provide a competitive advantage through increased future sales opportunities when corporate capital expenditures return to normalized levels 
finally  many smaller software providers that compete with the company fell into financial difficulties during as a result of the reluctance of customers to procure their software needs from a vendor lacking either a mature solution offering or secure financial outlook 
accordingly  the company believes that it is well positioned to offer the customers and potential customers of these vendors the software solution they need 
the company anticipates that its software license revenues will return to positive growth as the overall economic conditions strengthen and  more specifically  the overall demand for information technolog y increases 
while the company does not expect a significant improvement in information technology spending in the immediate future  the company expects that the actions taken by management during  along with a stabilizing economy in  may result in a modest increase in software license revenues i n the company expects the increase in software license revenues  if any  will occur primarily in the second half of as a percentage of total revenues  the company expects software license revenues to remain comparable to the levels achieved in the company s future software license revenues and operating performance may be negatively impacted by i the uncertainty in the information technology industry and associated reductions in capital expenditures  ii geopolitical uncertainties  including hostilities involving the united states and iraq  iii additional terrorist attacks  iv a lack of confidence in corporate governance and accounting practices  v the diversity in global economic conditions  vi continued intense competition  vii corporate and consumer confidence in the economy  evidenced  in part  by stock market levels  and viii other factors described under risk factors below 
professional services  maintenance and other 
professional services  maintenance and other revenues are primarily comprised o f professional services ie  implementation services and training and maintenance ie  technical support and product updates 
professional services are typically provided over a period of three to six months subsequent to the signing of a software license arrangement 
accordingly  the company s professional services revenues depend in large part on the company s software license revenues 
the company s maintenance revenues depend on both the company s software license revenues and renewals of maintenance agreements by the company s existing customer base 
professional services  maintenance and other revenues increased by from million for the year ended december   to  million for the year ended december   and decreased by from to million for the year ended december  as a percentage o f total revenues  professional services  maintenance and other revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the absolute dollar amount of professional services  maintenance and other revenues from to was primarily due to growth in the company s installed base of customers receiving maintenance and the growth of the company s consulting and training services 
the decrease in the absolute dollar amount of these revenues from to was primarily due to a decline in demand for the company s implementation and training services  partially offset by an increase in the installed base of customers receiving maintenance 
the year over year changes for and in both professional services and maintenance are discussed further below 
the company s maintenance revenues have continued to increase each quarter and on a year over year basis in both and  primarily due to the renewal of customer maintenance agreements and the signing of new maintenance agreements at the time of the software license 
however  du e primarily to weak economic conditions  the company s efforts to renew existing customers maintenance agreements have become progressively more challenging during while maintenance revenues have continued to increase each year  professional services revenues decreased on a year over year basis during compared to an increase during because the company s professional services revenues lag software license revenues by three to six months  both th e increase in and the decrease in were largely dependent on the amount of software license revenues in the immediate preceding period 
specifically  the significant growth in software license revenues in the second half of and the first quarter of enabled the company to grow professional services revenues in  despite the onset in early of deteriorating economic conditions 
the deteriorating economic conditions and resulting decline in software license revenues began to negatively impact professional services revenues in the second half of ie  three to six months subsequent to th e decline in software license revenues 
accordingly  the company s professional services revenues began to decline in the second half of and continued to decrease or remain at decreased levels throughout much of  and therefore declined on a year over year basis in in addition  the company has seen progressive pricing pressure on its professional services hourly rates as customers continue to focus on reducing costs in difficult economic conditions 
professional services  maintenance and other revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues during both and due primarily to growth in the number of customers receiving maintenance  coupled with a comparatively sharper decrease in the company s software license revenues 
the company expects that professional services  maintenance and othe r revenues will return to positive growth soon after the company s software license revenues return to positive growth 
the company currently anticipates that professional services  maintenance and other revenues will remain comparable to or increase from the levels achieved in as a percentage of total revenues  the company expects professional services  maintenance and othe r revenues to remain comparable to the levels achieved in the company expects to continue to manage its professional services organization to ensure that it does not compete with implementation partners 
on january   the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no

eitf requires that certain out of pocket expenses rebilled to customers be recorded as revenue versus an o ffset to the related expense 
prior to the adoption of eitf  the company recorded rebilled out of pocket expenses as an offset to the related expense 
comparative financial statements for prior periods have been conformed to the current year presentation 
amounts reclassified were not significant for any period presented 
cost of revenues and gross margin the company has reclassified certain prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation 
the following table sets forth th e company s cost of revenues and gross margin  both in absolute dollars and expressed as a percentage of total revenues  for the years ended december   and in thousands  except percentages year ended dece mber  cost of revenues software   professional services  maintenance and other   total cost of revenues   gross margin   as discussed further above and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company completed a tender offer for certain of its stock options during the third quarter of included in cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues for the year ended december   is a compensation charge of million related to the repurchase of stock options held by the company s professional services and technical support personnel 
the company views these expenses as significant special charges that make year over year comparison of the company s normal ongoing operating performance difficult 
accordingly  the following table sets forth the cost of revenues and gross margin for the years ended december   and  expressed both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues  prior to the cost of the option repurchase in thousands  except percentages year ended dece mber  cost of revenues software   professional services  maintenance and other   total cost of revenues   gross margin   please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the section entitled application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates below for description of the company s accounting policies and use of estimates related to expenses included in cost of revenues 
software 
cost of software license revenues includes amortization of acquired technology  third party software royalties  and product packaging  production and documentation 
all costs incurred in the research and development of software products and enhancements to existing products have been expensed as incurred 
cost of software license revenues was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
as a percentage of software license revenues  cost of software license revenues was for the years ended december  and  as compared to for the year ended december  cost of software license revenues decreased in absolute dollars from to primarily due to the decrease in software license revenues and a decrease in third party royalties 
cost of software license revenues increased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software license revenue from to primarily due to i an increase in amortization expense associated with the acquired technology obtained in the acquisition of nquire software  inc  as discussed in note t o the accompanying consolidated financial statements  and ii a shift to product s with higher third party royalties from products with either no royalty obligation or lower royalty rates 
these costs as a percentage of software license revenues are expected to remain comparable to the percentage incurred during professional services  maintenance and other 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues consist primarily of personnel  facilities and systems costs incurred to provide training  consulting and other global services 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as discussed above  the company completed a tender offer for certain of its option s during the third quarter of included in cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues for the year ended december   is a compensation charge of million related to the repurchase of stock options held by the company s professional service and technical support personnel 
excluding this compensation charge  cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues was million  million and million for th e years ended december   and  respectively  or approximately  and of professional services  maintenance and other revenues  respectively 
cost of professional services  maintenance and other revenues increased in terms of the absolute dollar amount from to primarily due to the increased headcount and associated costs that resulted fro m the company s expansion of its global services organization in order to meet th e demand for the company s consulting and training services 
the decrease in the absolute dollar amount of these costs from to reflects i the reduction of headcount in response to the decrease in demand for the company s implementation services  ii partial realization of the cost savings from the restructuring  including savings from the reduction of approximately personnel  iii a reduction in the use of third party contractors  and iv an acceleration of the company s cost control initiatives  including reductions of discretionary expenditures such as travel and entertainment and incentive and other variable compensation 
the decrease as a percentage of professional services  maintenance and other revenues for each of the periods reflects i the continued growth of the company s higher margin maintenance revenues  ii a higher utilization of the company s global services personnel  iii a reductio n in the use of third party contractors  iv an acceleration of the company s cost control initiatives discussed above  and v partial realization in o f the cost savings from the restructuring

please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources overview the company derives its liquidity and capital resources primarily from the company s cash flows from operations and from working capital 
the company s working capital increased by  from  million as of december   to  million as of december  the significant components of the company s working capital are liquid assets such as cash  short term investments and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued expenses and deferred revenue 
the company continues to operate a cash positive business and  accordingly  the company has continued to increase its cash and short term investment balances 
specifically  the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments increased from  million as of december   to  million as of december  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
in addition  the company improved the days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  which decreased from days as of december   to days as of december  in addition  the company has improved the average paymen t terms on license revenue transactions from days as of december   to days as of december  the company does not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor does it use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  the company s liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
the company s liquidity could be negatively impacted by a decrease in demand for the company s products which are subject to rapid technological changes  or a reduction of capital expenditures by the company s customers as a result of a downturn in the global economy  among other factors 
while the company believes that its current working capital and its anticipated cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet its cash needs for daily operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months  the company may elect to raise additional capital through a public offering of securities or other means in the future  depending upon market conditions 
commitments as of december   the company s future fixed commitments are as follows in thousands commitment yea r to to and contractual obligations beyond total operating lease obligations not in restructuring   operating lease obligations in restructuring   capital lease obligations   convertible subordinated debentures total fixed commitments   the lease commitments in the above table designated as lease obligations in restructuring only include the non cancelable portion of lease commitments included in the restructuring and  accordingly  have not been reduced by estimated sublease income

cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
despite the weak economic conditions  the company has continued to operate its business to produce positive cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities decreased in from primarily as the result of the decreases in revenues and earnings that occurred  in part  as a result of the weak global economic conditions 
during  and  the company s cas h flows from operations were primarily derived from i the company s earnings from on going operations prior to non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  and bad debt  less the cash portion of restructuring related expenses and option repurchase expenses  ii the tax benefit related to the exercise of employee stock options  which reduces the company s cash outlay for income tax expense  and iii changes in the company s working capital  which i s primarily composed of collections of accounts receivable and increases in deferred revenue  partially offset by payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
because the majority of the restructuring related expenses will be paid over time or do not involve cash outlays  cash provided b y operating activities for the year ended december   was only impacted by the million of cash payments made to date on these obligations 
as the company settles its remaining restructuring obligations million as of december   the company s future cash flows from operations will be reduced in the period of settlement 
the company currently estimates that it will settle million of these obligations in cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
durin g each of these periods  the company s investment activities primarily related to the purchase of additional property and equipment and the reinvestment of the company s cash into short term investments 
for  and  the company reinvested its cash flows from operations into short term investments i n net amounts of million  million and million  respectively  and had net purchases of property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  of million  million and million  respectively other investing activities resulted in net expenditures of million and million during and  respectively  as compared to a net increase in cash of million during capital expenditures were significantly higher in compared to both and  primarily as a result of the following i expansion of the company s infrastructure during to support the developmen t and testing of siebel  and ii purchases of tenant improvements and furnitur e and fixtures for newly leased facilities 
the company will continue to closely monitor its capital expenditures and currently expects that capital expenditure s will continue to decrease in cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively

during the company received proceeds of million from equipment financing 
these cash inflows from financing activities were partially offset during  and by the company s repayment of its capital lease obligations  net of collections by the company of stockholder notes 
adoption of accounting standards during  the company adopted new accounting standards related to the accounting for its business combinations  intangible assets and goodwill  impairment of long lived assets  discontinued operations  presentation of rebilled out of pocket expenses and stock based compensation 
there was not a cumulative transition adjustment upon the adoption of any of these accounting standards  and the adoption of these accounting standards did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these accounting standards 
seasonality the company s first quarter revenues have typically been lower than the revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter because the majority of the company s customers begin a new fiscal year on january and capital expenditures tend to be lower in an organization s first quarter than i n its fourth quarter 
the company anticipates that this seasonality will continue  however  the seasonality between the fourth quarter and first quarter may be further impacted by changes in the global economy and other factors 
please refer to risk factors our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates use of estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states herein after referred to as gaap and the application of gaap requires management to make estimates that affect the company s reporte d amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure o f contingent assets and liabilities 
in many instances  the company could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by management 
to the extent that there are material difference s between these estimates and actual results  the company s future financial statement presentation of its financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns  fair value of investments  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  income taxes  restructuring obligations  and contingencies and litigation  among others 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company refers to accounting estimate s of this type as critical accounting estimates  which are discussed further below 
in addition to these estimates and assumptions that are utilized in the preparation of historical financial statements  the inability t o properly estimate the timing and amount of future revenues could significantly impact the company s future operations 
while the company s software allows it to monitor potential revenues and aids in its ability to manage the size of its operations  management must make assumptions and estimates as to the timing and amount of future revenue 
specifically  the company s sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the estimated closing date and potential dollar amount of such transaction 
the company aggregates these estimates periodically to generate a sales pipeline and then evaluates the pipeline to identify trends in the company s business 
this pipeline analysis and related estimates of revenue may differ significantly from actual revenues in a particular reporting period as the estimates and assumptions were made using th e best available data at the time  which is subject to change 
specifically  the slowdown in the global economy and information technology spending has caused and may continue to cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or canceled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion rate of the pipeline into contracts could cause the company to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  because a substantial portion of the company s software license contracts close in the latter part of a quarter  management may not be able to adjust the company s cost structure to respond to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline in a timely manner  and thereby the delays may adversely and materially affect the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
critical accounting policies in addition to making critical accounting estimates  the company must ensure that its financial statements are properly stated in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions eg  stock base d compensation  restructuring activities  depreciation methodology  etc the company believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policie s relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates revenue recognition  restructuring related expenses  stock based compensation  option repurchase  the provision for doubtful accounts  acquired intangible assets  impairment of long lived assets  other than temporary declines in the market value of investments  and income taxes 
the company s management has reviewed its critical accounting policies  its critical accounting estimates  and the related disclosures with our disclosure and audit committees 
these policies  and the company s procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
in addition  please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a further description of the company s accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company generates its revenues primarily by licensing software  providing software support and maintenance and providing professional services to its customers 
the company s software arrangements typically include i an end user license that provides for an initial fee in exchange for a customer s use of the company s products in perpetuity based on a specified number of users  ii a maintenance arrangement that provides for technical support and product updates over a period of months  and iii a professional services arrangement on a time and materials basis 
the company recognizes software revenue using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position no 
software revenue recognition sop  as amended by statement of position no 
software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
under the residual method  revenue is recognized when company specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
each license arrangement require s careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each element 
the company allocates revenue to each undelivered element based on its respective fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
the company determines the fair value of the maintenance portion of the arrangement based on the renewal price of the maintenance charged to the customer based on full deployment of the licensed software products and the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement based on the hourly rates that the company charges for these services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidenc e of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that these elements are delivered 
for substantially all of the company s software arrangements  the company defers revenue for the fair value of the maintenance and professional services to be provided to the customer and recognizes revenue for the software license when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and delivery has occurred  provided the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
the company evaluates each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement the company considers a non cancelable agreement signed by the company and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery delivery is considered to occur when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
the company s typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
fixed or determinable fee the company considers the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment 
if the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  the company recognizes the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
collection is deemed probable the company conducts a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if the company expects that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if the company determines that collection is not probable  the company defers the revenue and recognizes the revenue upon cash collection 
a customer typically prepays maintenance for the first months  and the related revenue is deferred and recognized over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
professional services revenue primarily consists of implementation services related to the installation of the company s products and training revenues 
the company s software is ready to use by the customer upon receipt 
while many of the company s customers may choose to tailor the software to fit their specific needs  the company s implementation services do not involve significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
substantially all of the company s professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis and  accordingly  are recognized as the services are performed  which is typically over a three to six month period subsequent to licensing of the company s software 
restructuring related expenses the company s restructuring charges are comprised primarily of i severance and associated employee termination costs related to the reduction of the company s workforce in  ii lease termination costs and or costs associated with permanently vacating its facilities abandonment  and iii impairment costs related to certain long lived assets abandoned 
the company accounts for each of these costs in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
restructuring and impairment charges 
in addition  the company accounts for the individual components of the restructuring as discussed further below 
the company accounts for the costs associated with the reduction of the company s workforce in accordance with eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
accordingly  the company records the liability related to these termination costs when the following conditions have been met i management with the appropriate level of authority approves a termination plan that commits the company to such plan and establishes the benefits the employees will receive upon termination  ii the benefit arrangement is communicated to the employees in sufficient detail to enable the employees to determine the termination benefits  iii the plan specifically identifies the number of employees to be terminated  their locations and their job classifications  and iv the period of time to implement the plan does not indicate changes to the plan are likely 
the termination costs recorded by the company are not associated with nor do they benefit continuing activities 
the company accounts for the costs associated with lease termination and or abandonment in accordance with eitf accordingly  the company records the costs associated with lease termination and or abandonment when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to the company 
under eitf  the company records the liability associated with lease termination and or abandonment as the sum of the total remaining lease costs and related exit costs  less probable sublease income 
the company accounts for costs related to long lived assets abandoned in accordance with sfas and  accordingly  charges to expense the net carrying value of the long lived assets when the company ceases to use the assets 
inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the company s restructuring efforts are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the restructuring 
in determining the charge related to the restructuring  the majority of estimates made by management related to the charge for excess facilities 
in determining the charge for excess facilities  the company was required to estimate future sublease income  future net operating expenses of the facilities  and brokerage commissions  among other expenses 
the most significant of these estimates related to the timing and extent of future sublease income in which to reduce the company s lease obligations 
specifically  in determining the restructuring obligations related to facilities as of december   the company reduced its lease obligations by estimated sublease income of million 
the company based its estimates of sublease income  in part  on the opinions of independent real estate experts  current market conditions and rental rates  an assessment of the time period over which reasonable estimates could be made  the status of negotiations with potential subtenants  and the location of the respective facility  among other factors 
these estimates  along with other estimates made by management in connection with the restructuring  may vary significantly depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond the company s control 
specifically  these estimates will depend on the company s success in negotiating with lessors  the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
adjustments to the facilities reserve will be required if actual lease exit costs or sublease income differ from amounts currently expected 
the company will review the status of restructuring activities on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to its restructuring obligations in current operations based on management s most current estimates 
stock based compensation the company has elected to continue to account for its employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees and interpretations thereof collectively apb versus the fair value method allowed by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
accordingly  deferred compensation is only recorded if the current price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price on the date of grant 
the company records and measures deferred compensation for stock options granted to non employees at their fair value 
deferred compensation is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock option  which is generally five years 
please refer to the section entitled employee stock options for further discussion of the company s accounting for its stock based compensation plans 
option repurchase the company accounted for the option repurchase in accordance with apb specifically  the company determined that the consideration paid for the eligible options represented substantial consideration as required by issue f of eitf issue no 
issues relating to accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 as the offered by the company for each eligible option was at least the fair value for each eligible option  as determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
in determining the fair value of the eligible options using the black scholes option pricing model  the company used the following assumptions i the expected remaining life was deemed to be the remaining term of the stock options  which ranged from approximately seven years to eight years  ii a volatility of during the expected life  iii a risk free interest rate of  and iv no dividends 
the repurchase amount of per eligible option was established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged throughout the offer period 
because substantial consideration was provided in exchange for repurchase of eligible options  as described in issue f of eitf issue no 
 the company concluded that variable accounting would not be required for stock options granted to participants more than six months prior to the date of the offer 
further  variable accounting is not required under issue a of eitf issue no 
for eligible options subject to the offer that were not surrendered for repurchase  because i the shares of common stock offered were fully vested and non forfeitable  and ii the number of common shares to be received by an employee who accepts the offer is based on the number of surrendered stock options multiplied by  divided by the fair value of the common stock at the date of repurchase 
the company further concluded that the look back and look forward provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 paragraph apply to the stock options surrendered for repurchase 
because the company had granted no stock options to the holders of the eligible options in the six months preceding the commencement of the tender offer period  variable accounting is not required for any of the company s outstanding stock options not subject to the option repurchase 
the company does not intend to grant stock options to any participants in the option repurchase for at least six months following the conclusion of the tender offer period 
if any stock options are granted to participants in the option repurchase within the six months following the end of the tender offer period  those stock options will receive variable accounting 
provision for doubtful accounts the company initially records its provision for doubtful accounts based on its historical experience and then adjusts this provision at the end of each reporting period based on a detailed assessment of its accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
in estimating the provision for doubtful accounts  management considers i the aging of the accounts receivable  ii trends within and ratios involving the age of the accounts receivable  iii the customer mix in each of the aging categories and the nature of the receivable ie license  consulting  maintenance  etc  iv the company s historical provision for doubtful accounts  which has ranged on a quarterly basis between and of total revenues and on an annual basis between and of total revenues generally approximately of total revenues  v the credit worthiness of each customer  vi the economic conditions of the customer s industry  and vii general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could impact the level of the company s future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
if the company had recorded its provision for doubtful accounts based on the historical annual ranges above  the company s provision for doubtful accounts for would have ranged between million and million  compared to the million reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the company recorded the provision for doubtful accounts for at the lower end of this range approximately of total revenues  based on improvement in the above metrics  including a decrease in days sales outstanding from days as of december   to days as of december  a number of the company s customers are in the telecommunications industry and  as discussed previously  as part of the company s evaluation of its provision for doubtful accounts  the company has considered not only the economic conditions in that industry but also the financial condition of the company s customers in that industry in determining the provision for doubtful accounts 
if conditions continue to deteriorate in that industry  or any other industry  then an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required 
acquired intangible assets the company accounts for its purchases of acquired companies in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations sfas and accounts for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas in accordance with sfas  the company allocates the cost of the acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as acquired technology  are amortized to expense over time  while in process research and development costs ipr d  if any  are recorded at the acquisition date 
the majority of entities acquired by the company do not have significant tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price is typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
the company s future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of intangible assets  potential charges related to ipr d for future acquisitions  and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
as required by sfas  the company has not amortized goodwill associated with acquisitions completed after june   for any period presented and ceased amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions completed prior to july   effective january  prior to january   the company amortized goodwill associated with the pre july  acquisitions over three to five years using the straight line method 
identifiable intangibles acquired technology are currently amortized over three years using the straight line method 
as described below  in lieu of amortizing goodwill  the company tests goodwill for impairment periodically and records any necessary impairment in accordance with sfas impairment of long lived assets the company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with the company s determination that it has only one reporting segment  the company has determined that it has only one reporting unit  specifically the license  implementation and support of its software applications 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually on july in a two step process 
first  the company must determine if the carrying amount of its reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of the company s common stock  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if the company determines that goodwill may be impaired  the company compares the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 
the company evaluates all of its long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill  for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets other than goodwill be evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to that asset 
should events indicate that any of the company s assets are impaired  the amount of such impairment will be measured as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the impaired asset and recorded in earnings during the period of such impairment 
other than temporary declines in the market value of investments the company records an investment impairment charge when it determines an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
to make this determination  the company reviews the carrying value of its short term investments and marketable equity securities  along with investments accounted for under the cost method  at the end of each reporting period to determine if any investments are impaired 
this review includes an evaluation of historical and projected financial performance  expected cash needs and recent funding events 
other than temporary impairments are recognized in operations if i the market value of the investment is below its current carrying value for an extended period  which the company generally defines as six to nine months  ii the issuer has experienced significant financial difficulties  or iii the issuer has experienced significant problems in raising capital to continue operations  among other factors 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
income taxes as of december   the company s valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets pertains to certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards resulting from the exercise of certain employee stock options 
the valuation allowance will be reduced in the period in which the company realizes a benefit on its tax return from a reduction of income taxes payable from the utilization of these credits and losses 
when realized  the tax benefit of these credits and losses will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity rather than as a reduction of income tax expense 
the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this involves estimating the company s current tax liabilities in each jurisdiction  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on the company s estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction  a valuation allowance is established 
tax liabilities can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
the company has considered future taxable income and the existence of prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for an additional valuation allowance on its remaining deferred tax assets and has concluded that no additional allowance is currently required 
in the event the company were to determine in the future that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
pre approval of non audit services on october   the audit committee of the board of directors approved the engagement of kpmg llp  the company s independent auditors  to perform certain permitted tax related and other non audit services for the company 
however  the audit committee resolved that  to the extent the fees for any particular engagement exceed  each such engagement must be approved in advance in writing by the audit committee or its appointed delegate 
employee stock options section i 
description of plans since the company s inception in  the company s compensation philosophy has been based on its belief in broad employee ownership 
accordingly  the company s stock option program has been a key component of the company s compensation packages for its employees and has been instrumental in attracting and retaining talented employees and aligning their interests with the interests of existing stockholders

please refer to the report of the compensation committee of the board of directors on executive compensation appearing in item of this annual report on form k for further information concerning the policies and procedures of the company and the compensation committee regarding the use of stock options 
section ii 
significant actions taken during related to stock options historically  stock options have been an important component of total compensation for the company s employees 
accordingly  substantially all employees are granted stock options upon employment  including the company s assumption of outstanding stock options of acquired businesses 
in addition  the company has on occasion rewarded existing employees for high levels of performance with additional grants of stock options 
these factors  coupled with significant growth in the company s employee base  resulted in a significant number of outstanding stock options relative to shares outstanding as of december  the company had million stock options outstanding as compared to common shares outstanding 
the company recognizes that stock options may dilute existing stockholders and  accordingly  took several steps during and early to reduce the number of stock options outstanding by million  or  from the levels outstanding as of december  as a result  stock options outstanding relative to shares outstanding decreased from as of december   to as of december  calculated as if all actions had occurred as of december  
these actions  each of which is described further below  included i the option repurchase  ii the cancellation of million of the company s ceo s stock options in january  and iii significantly reduced levels of stock option grants during  coupled with forfeitures of stock options by terminated employees 
the company believes that these actions will continue to better align the interests of its employees and management with the interests of its stockholders 
option repurchase as discussed previously and in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  the company completed a tender offer during to repurchase million stock options for total consideration of million  consisting of million of fully vested  non forfeitable shares of the company s common stock million shares and million in cash 
a total of million of these shares are subject to a holding period as further described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company offered to repurchase these stock options primarily through the issuance of shares of its common stock in order to i improve employee morale by eliminating out of the money stock options  ii reduce the net future dilution to existing stockholders  and iii better align employees interests with those of stockholders 
as a result of the option repurchase  outstanding stock options decreased by from the levels as of december   representing net potential dilution to existing stockholders of 
the potential dilution to stockholders is calculated as the stock options canceled less million shares of common stock issued in exchange for the stock options  divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of december  ceo option cancellation as described more fully in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  at the request of its ceo  the company cancelled million of the ceo s stock options in january the stock options cancelled had exercise prices ranging from to per share and a black scholes calculated fair value of million at the time of cancellation stock options that were in the money at the time of cancellation represented million  or  of the total fair value at cancellation 
this cancellation represented all stock options granted to the company s ceo since october the company s ceo requested the cancellation of these stock options primarily to reduce the number of outstanding stock options relative to the number of shares outstanding 
as a result of this cancellation  outstanding stock options decreased by from the levels as of december   representing net potential dilution to existing stockholders of 
the potential dilution to stockholders is calculated as the stock options canceled  divided by the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of december  the company has provided no compensation in exchange for the cancellation of the ceo s stock options  nor will it provide any compensation in the future in exchange for such cancellation 
grants and forfeitures in order to maintain the proper balance between the need to attract and retain employees and minimize the dilution to existing stockholders in  the company adjusted its compensation structure to significantly reduce the number of stock options issued to new and existing employees 
moreover  the company limited the number of stock options that it granted to its employee base  such that substantially all stock option grants related to newly hired employees 
accordingly  the company s ceo and five most highly compensated executive officers in collectively the named executive officers did not receive any stock option grants during  other than a grant to an officer hired in the third quarter of in addition  the number of stock options outstanding decreased during as a result of forfeitures by employees upon termination  the majority of which resulted from the company s workforce reduction described above under the heading restructuring 
as a result of the forfeitures by employees upon termination and the company s limitation of stock option grants  the company s outstanding stock options decreased by from the levels as of december   representing a decrease in net potential dilution to existing stockholders of 
this percentage decrease compared to an increase in incremental net potential dilution to stockholders of and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the potential dilution to stockholders from stock options otherwise known as the dilution percentage is calculated as the stock options forfeited by employees leaving the company  net of new stock options granted during the year  divided by the total outstanding shares of common stock at the beginning of the year 
please refer to note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a rollforward of stock option activity  including stock options granted and forfeited  for each of the years ended december   and anticipated stock option grants the company intends to continue to manage the number of stock options granted in the future  while still providing competitive compensation packages to its employees 
the company currently expects that the incremental dilution percentage resulting from new stock option grants for will be less than the dilution percentage for and  but will be higher than the percentage for this estimate could differ from the actual percentage for  depending on various factors  including changes in estimated stock option grants for planned hiring  acquisition  merit and retention based programs

section iv 
accounting for stock based compensation the company accounts for its employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method  as prescribed by apb accordingly  deferred compensation is only recorded if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the stock option on the date of grant 
the company records and measures deferred compensation for stoc k options granted to non employees at their fair value 
deferred compensation is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the related stock option  which is generally five years 
there were no grants of stock options a t exercise prices below the fair market value of the company s common stock on th e date of grant during  and the company did  however  grant  shares of restricted common stock to its senior vice president  worldwide sales in connection with his commencement of employment in september for cash consideration of the shares of restricted stock had a fair value at the date of grant of  which was recorded as deferred compensation and will be amortized to compensation expense over the five year vesting period 
an alternative to the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options is the fair value approach allowed by sfas the company has continued to follow the intrinsic value method of apb  as th e company believes the accounting for stock options under sfas is highly subjective and does not necessarily reflect the economic substance of an employee stock option 
specifically  the compensation cost under sfas is recognized ratably over the vesting period  regardless of whether the stock options exercise prices are below the fair value of the company s common stock in addition  compensation expense related to vested stock options that are subsequently forfeited or canceled is reflected in operations  despite the fact that the stock options did not provide an equivalent monetary value in compensation to the employee or dilute existing stockholders 
subsequent to cancellation of a stock option  no additional compensation expense for that cancelled stock option is reported in the pro forma disclosure of stock based compensation 
further  under the fair value approach  employee stock options are required to be valued at grant date using an option valuation model such as black scholes 
the company believes there are limitations to the appropriateness of the black scholes option valuation model  including the fact that the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have no vesting restrictions are fully transferable  and typically have shorter terms 
in addition  the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and the expected remaining life 
because the company s stock based awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in the company s opinion  the existing models that are available to value stock option s do not provide an appropriate measure of the fair value of stock based awards t o its employees 
as required by sfas  the company discloses the pro forma effect on its earnings and earnings per share data  as if the company had adopted sfas  in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this pro forma effect on earnings represents the amortization of the deferred compensation that is computed using the black scholes option valuation model at the date of the stock option grant 
summarized below are th e pro forma effects on the company s net income loss  if the company had electe d to use the fair value approach prescribed by sfas to account for its employee stock based compensation plans in thousands year ended december  net income loss available to common stockholders as reported less compensation expense under sfas related to in the money stock options stock purchase rights under the purchase plan total pro forma expense  in the money stock options and purchase plan

these factors include corporate and consumer confidence in the economy  evidenced  in part  by stock market levels  changes in the domestic and international economic  business and political conditions  economic conditions within the information technology industry  level of product and price competition  length of our sales cycle and customer licensing patterns  size and timing of individual license transactions  delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  success in expanding our global services organization  direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  appropriate mix of products licensed and services sold  levels of international transactions  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  timing of new hires and the allocation of our resources  increases in the cost of software and professional services  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and our ability to develop and market new products and control costs 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our net revenue and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based upon the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate 
our total revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
the main factors that may affect these fluctuations are domestic and international economic  business and political conditions  economic conditions within the information technology industry  the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles  the size and complexity of our license transactions  the potential delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  the timing of new product releases  seasonal variations in operating results  and variations in the fiscal or quarterly cycles of our customers 
each customer s decision to implement our products and services is discretionary  involves a significant commitment of resources and is subject to its budget cycles 
in addition  the timing of license revenue is difficult to predict because of the length of our sales cycle  which has ranged to date from one to twenty four months 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends 
because a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from license transactions could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
if these expenses precede  or are not subsequently followed by  increased revenues  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of these and other factors  revenues for any quarter are subject to significant variation  and we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indications of future performance 
our future quarterly operating results from time to time may not meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  which would likely have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
economic conditions could adversely affect our revenue growth and ability to forecast revenue 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for ebusiness applications software and services  particularly within the industries in which we offer specific versions of our products 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers in the high technology  telecommunications  financial services including insurance  pharmaceutical  utilities and consumer packaged goods industries  our business depends on the overall economic conditions and the economic and business conditions within these industries 
the progressive weakening of the global economy  the weakening of the information technology industry  and the weakening of the business conditions within the industries listed above has caused a decrease in our software license revenues in both and a decrease in demand for computer software caused  in part  by a continued weakening of the economy  domestically or internationally  may result in a continued decrease in revenues and growth rates 
hostilities involving the united states and or terrorist attacks could harm our business 
the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states have led to a weakening of the global economy 
as a result  many of our customers and potential customers have become much more cautious in setting their capital expenditure budgets  thereby restricting their software procurement to well defined current needs 
in addition  recent economic data  such as the united states unemployment rate and consumer confidence measures  appear to indicate that the growing threat of hostilities involving the united states and iraq has further weakened the global economy 
the reduction in business and investor confidence is also reflected in the weakening equity markets 
subsequent terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our software license revenue and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a variation in the conversion of our revenue pipeline to contracts could adversely affect our revenues and ability to forecast operations 
our revenue pipeline estimates may not consistently correlate to actual revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
a slowdown in the economy  domestically and internationally  has caused and may continue to cause customer purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or canceled  all of which have reduced and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the pipeline into contracts 
a variation in the pipeline or in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and thereby could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  primarily due to a substantial portion of our license revenue contracts closing in the latter part of a quarter  management may not be able to adjust our cost structure in response to a variation in the conversion of the pipeline into contracts in a timely manner  thereby adversely affecting our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement our restructuring efforts  and such efforts may adversely impact our ability to retain and attract future employees 
during  we completed a restructuring of our operations involving  among other things  the reduction of our workforce by approximately  employees worldwide and the consolidation of excess facilities 
as part of this restructuring  we permanently removed from our operations certain of our leased facilities 
the removal of these facilities from our operations will require us to negotiate certain lease terminations and or subleases of our facilities 
we cannot predict when or if we will be successful in negotiating lease termination agreements or subleases of our facilities on terms acceptable to us 
should we be unsuccessful in such negotiations or if the negotiated terms are less favorable than currently anticipated  we may be required to materially increase our restructuring charge in future periods 
in addition  our restructuring program may not achieve all of the benefits we currently anticipate or on the timetable contemplated 
workforce reductions  including the one we completed in  could result in a lack of focus and reduced productivity by our remaining employees  which in turn may affect our revenues in a future quarter 
in addition  prospects and current customers may decide to delay or not purchase our products due to the perceived uncertainty caused by our restructuring 
we cannot assure you that we will not reduce or otherwise adjust our workforce again in the future or that the related transition issues associated with such a reduction will not occur again 
in addition  employees  whether or not directly affected by the reduction  may seek future employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire  we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of certain proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
further  we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we may have difficulty attracting such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce reductions 
if we do not successfully manage the size of our operations  our business may be negatively impacted 
if we fail to manage the size of our operations effectively  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
since we began operations in and continuing throughout early  our business grew rapidly 
throughout and  our revenues have declined as a result of deterioration in the overall economy and information technology industry 
these rapid changes in our business have placed a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
in response to the continued deterioration in the information technology industry  management completed a restructuring of our operations in this restructuring has particular risks  many of which are discussed above under we may not be able to successfully implement our restructuring efforts  and such efforts may adversely impact our ability to retain and attract future employees 
in addition  if we return to growth in the future  that growth may require us to implement new systems or upgrade current systems  and the failure to successfully implement such new or improved systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
rapid change will require us to manage the size of our employee base  particularly our direct sales force and global support staff 
the majority of our expenses are personnel related costs such as employee compensation and benefits  along with the cost of the infrastructure occupancy and equipment to support our employee base 
the failure to adjust our employee base  particularly our direct sales force and technical and global services staff  to the appropriate level to support our revenues could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  expansion of the distribution of our products may place new and increased demands on our direct sales force and technical and sales support staff 
although we currently invest sufficient resources in our direct sales force and our technical and global services staff  there are only a limited number of qualified personnel in these areas 
our ability to achieve expanded distribution and revenue growth in the future will depend  in part  on our success in recruiting and training sufficient direct sales  technical and global services personnel 
we may not be able to expand our direct sales force and technical support staff as necessary to support our operations 
we rely on strategic relationships with systems integrators  distributors  resellers and technology vendors 
failure to maintain existing strategic relationships with systems integrators  distributors  resellers and technology vendors  or to establish new relationships in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have established strategic relationships with a number of organizations that we believe are important to our sales  marketing and support activities and the implementation of our products 
we believe that our relationships with these organizations provide marketing and sales opportunities for our direct sales force and expand the distribution of our products 
these relationships allow us to keep pace with the technological and marketing developments of major software vendors and provide us with technical assistance for our product development efforts 
in particular  we have established non exclusive strategic relationships with accenture  cap gemini ernst young  deloitte consulting  ibm global services and pricewaterhousecoopers  among others 
a significant portion of our revenues has historically been derived from customers that have engaged systems integrators with which we have a relationship 
any deterioration of our relationship with these significant third party systems integrators could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we also have relationships with technology vendors such as hewlett packard compaq  ibm corporation  microsoft corporation  and sun microsystems  inc  among others 
failure to maintain existing relationships on terms equally favorable to us  or to establish new relationships in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our current and potential customers may also rely on third party systems integrators to develop  deploy or manage siebel ebusiness applications 
if we do not adequately train a sufficient number of systems integrators  or if these integrators do not have  or do not devote  the resources necessary to implement our products  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our customers may not successfully implement our products 
if existing customers have difficulty deploying siebel ebusiness applications or for any other reason are not satisfied with siebel ebusiness applications  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
many of our customers purchase and implement our products in phases 
our customers frequently deploy our products to large numbers of sales  marketing and customer service personnel 
these end users may not accept our products 
our products are also being deployed on a variety of computer hardware platforms and used with a number of third party software applications and programming tools 
this use may present significant technical challenges  particularly as large numbers of personnel attempt to use our products concurrently 
a limited number of products provide a substantial part of our license revenues 
a majority of our software license revenues in are attributable to sales of siebel sales  siebel service  siebel call center  siebel analytics  siebel interactive selling  siebel employee relationship management and related products 
in addition  we offer industry specific versions of these products 
we expect that these products and related consulting  maintenance and training services will continue to account for a majority of our future revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to market and maintain the industry specific versions of our products 
factors adversely affecting the cost and pricing of  or demand for  these products  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
the length of time required to engage a client and to implement our products may be lengthy and unpredictable 
the timing of the sales and implementation of our products and services is lengthy and not predictable with any degree of accuracy 
prior sales and implementation cycles should not be relied upon as any indication of future cycles 
the license of our software products is often an enterprise wide decision by prospective customers and generally requires us to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
in addition  the implementation of our products involves a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers and is commonly associated with reengineering efforts that may be performed by the customer or third party systems integrators 
the cost to the customer of our product is typically only a portion of the related hardware  software  development  training and integration costs of implementing a large scale ebusiness software system 
for these and other reasons  the period between initial contact and the implementation of our products is often lengthy and is subject to a number of factors that may cause significant delays  over many of which we have little or no control 
these factors include the size and complexity of the overall project and delays in our customers implementation of web based computing environments 
a delay in the sale or implementation of even a limited number of license transactions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations and cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
as a result of current economic conditions  our sales cycle has recently become longer than historical sales cycles 
our software license revenue is dependent on our ability to enter into significant software license transactions with new and existing customers 
our success depends on gaining new customers and maintaining relationships with our existing customers 
in particular  if the number of software license transactions and the average size of these transactions decrease  our software license revenue may be negatively impacted 
both the number of transactions generating software license revenues and the average size of these transactions have declined over the past two years 
specifically  the number of transactions generating software license revenues greater than million has decreased from transactions in and transactions in  to transactions in in addition  the average size of these transactions has decreased in each of the last two years from  in  to  in and  in consequently  our software license revenue also decreased in both and the failure to enter into significant software license transactions with new and existing customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
no single customer has accounted for or more of our software license revenues in  or our distribution channels may create additional risks 
failure to minimize channel conflicts could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a number of relationships with resellers  which assist us in obtaining broad market coverage 
we have generally avoided exclusive relationships with resellers of our products 
discount policies and reseller licensing programs are intended to support each distribution channel with a minimum level of channel conflicts 
our continued success will require us to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
the software market in which we compete is characterized by i rapid technological change  ii frequent introductions of new products  iii changing customer needs  and iv evolving industry standards 
to keep pace with technological developments  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs  we must support existing products and develop new products 
we may not be successful in developing  marketing and releasing new products or new versions of siebel ebusiness applications that respond to technological developments  evolving industry standards or changing customer requirements 
we may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of these enhancements 
in addition  these enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and may not achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
if release dates of any future products or enhancements to siebel ebusiness applications are delayed  or if these products or enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance when released  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  new products or enhancements by our competitors may cause customers to defer or forego purchases of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may not be able to compete effectively in the internet related products and services market 
siebel ebusiness applications communicate through public and private networks over the internet 
the success of our products may depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing products that are compatible with the internet 
we cannot predict with any assurance whether the demand for internet related products and services will increase or decrease in the future 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our products and the introduction of new products 
critical issues concerning the commercial use of the internet  including security  privacy  demand  reliability  cost  ease of use  accessibility  quality of service and potential tax or other government regulation remain unresolved and may affect the use of the internet as a medium to support the functionality of our products and distribution of our software 
if these critical issues are not favorably resolved  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we operate in a competitive and rapidly changing market 
if the web based applications market fails to grow  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
the market for web based applications software is relatively new  highly competitive and rapidly changing 
we market our products only to customers who have migrated or are in the process of migrating their enterprise computing systems to web based computing environments 
our future financial performance will partly depend on the continued growth of organizations successfully adopting web based computing environments 
to be successful  we must effectively compete in the ebusiness systems market 
our products target the ebusiness systems market 
this market is highly competitive  rapidly changing and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
our products are targeted at the emerging market for customer  partner and employee relationship information systems 
we face competition primarily from our customers internal information technology departments and systems integrators  as well as from other application software providers that offer a variety of products and services designed to address this market 
we believe that most customer deployments have been the result of large internal development projects  custom solutions from systems integrators or the application of personal and departmental productivity tools to the global enterprise 
we may not be able to compete successfully against such internal development efforts 
during and  the global economy impacted the competitive dynamics of the ebusiness systems market in which we compete in variety ways 
specifically  our customers and prospective customers are increasingly evaluating their software procurement needs with a focus on the long term total cost of ownership which includes the cost of the license and the cost of professional services  such as implementation  training  and technical support 
with significantly lower license costs from competitive solutions  and no license cost for internal projects  our success is dependent on our ability to justify both the lowest total cost of ownership and overall return on investment 
we frequently rely on a number of systems consulting and systems integration firms for a substantial portion of implementation and other global services  as well as for recommendations of our products during the evaluation stage of the purchase process 
although we seek to maintain close relationships with these service providers  many of them have similar and often more established relationships with our competitors 
if we are unable to develop and retain effective  long term relationships with these third parties  our competitive position could be materially and adversely affected 
further  many of these third parties have significantly greater resources than we do and may market software products that compete with us and may otherwise reduce or discontinue their relationships with or support of us and our products 
a large number of personal  departmental and other products exist in the ebusiness applications market 
our competitors include a number of companies that compete with us primarily within a particular product line eg  analytics  interactive selling  etc 
and or the prospective customer s industry eg  life sciences  financial services  eg these companies include amdocs limited  cas gmbh  chordiant software  inc  dendrite international  inc  e 
piphany  inc  frontrange solutions  inc  interact commerce corporation  kana software  inc  onyx software corporation  pivotal corporation  and salesforce 
com  inc  among many others 
in addition  our competitors include several companies  such as oracle corporation  peoplesoft  inc and sap ag  which compete in a majority of the company s product lines 
some of these competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  significantly greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers than we do 
in addition  many competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
there are many factors that may increase competition in the ebusiness systems market  including i entry of new competitors  ii alliances among existing competitors  iii alliances between our competitors and systems integrators  iv consolidation in the software industry or among systems integrators  and v technological changes or changes in the use of the internet 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and competitive pressures faced by us may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we do not maintain our relationships with third party vendors  interruptions in the supply of our products may result 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
portions of our products incorporate software that was developed and is maintained by third party software developers 
although we believe there are other sources for these products  any significant interruption in the supply of these products could adversely impact our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we depend in part on these third parties abilities to enhance their current products  to develop new products on a timely and cost effective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
the absence of or any significant delay in the replacement of functionality provided by third party software in our products could materially and adversely affect our sales 
software errors or defects in our products could reduce revenues 
software products frequently contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released  and could be affected by viruses 
we have  in the past  been forced to delay the commercial release of products until the correction of software problems 
we could lose revenues as a result of software viruses  errors or defects  including defects in third party products with which our products work 
our products are intended for use in applications that may be critical to a customer s business 
as a result  we expect that our customers and potential customers will have a greater sensitivity to product defects than the market for software products generally 
testing errors may also be found in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments  resulting in loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation  or increased service and warranty costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we need to successfully integrate acquisitions 
our business strategy includes pursuing opportunities to grow our business  internally and through selective acquisitions  investments  joint ventures and strategic alliances 
our ability to implement this strategy depends  in part  on our success in making such acquisitions  investments  joint ventures and strategic alliances on satisfactory terms and successfully integrating them into our operations 
implementation of this strategy may impose significant strains on our management  operating systems and financial resources 
failure to manage this growth  or unexpected difficulties encountered during expansion  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
integration of personnel and operations relating to our previous or future acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire additional companies 
we may not be able to successfully assimilate the additional personnel  operations  acquired technology and products acquired from these companies into our business 
in particular  we will need to assimilate and retain key professional services  sales  engineering and marketing personnel 
key personnel from the acquired companies have in certain instances decided  and they may in the future decide  to pursue other opportunities 
in addition  it may be necessary to integrate products of these companies with our technology  and it is uncertain whether we may accomplish this easily or at all 
these integration difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and employees or increase expenses 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and we may also face unexpected costs  which may adversely affect operating results in any quarter 
if we acquire additional companies  products or technologies  we may face risks similar to those faced in our other acquisitions 
we may continue to make other investments in complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of any other acquisition or investment 
if we acquire another company  we will likely face the same risks  uncertainties and disruptions as discussed above with respect to our other acquisitions 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets 
the loss of key personnel could negatively affect our performance 
our performance depends on the continued service of our key technical  sales and senior management personnel  particularly thomas m 
siebel  our chairman and ceo 
our key employees have not entered into employment agreements with us 
the loss of one or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
on september   we announced the appointment of richard p 
chiarello as our senior vice president  worldwide sales 
mr 
chiarello replaced mark hanson  who managed our worldwide sales activities in an interim capacity and remains with the company in a senior executive role 
to integrate into our company  new senior personnel must spend a significant amount of time learning our business model and management systems  in addition to performing their regular duties 
accordingly  until new senior personnel become familiar with our business model and systems  their integration may result in some disruption to our ongoing operations 
in addition  we announced in january that paul wahl  our president and chief operating officer  will retire in march we do not currently intend to replace mr 
wahl  and as a result  have modified certain of our day to day operational matters 
until senior personnel become familiar with our modified operational structure  there may be some disruption to our ongoing operations 
leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
as of december   we have million of convertible subordinated notes outstanding  bearing interest at and due september  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
while our current cash and short term investments are sufficient to pay our current outstanding indebtedness  we cannot assure you that any future financing arrangements will be available  or if available  on terms acceptable to us 
our current or future leverage could have negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources 
we may not be able to protect our proprietary information 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures  and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we also believe that the technological and creative skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  name recognition and reliable product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under patent  trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 
any patents issued to us may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek  if at all 
furthermore  others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around our patents 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights in the united states or abroad may not be adequate 
we have entered into agreements with substantially all of our customers that require us to place siebel ebusiness applications source code into escrow 
such agreements generally provide that such parties will have a limited  non exclusive right to use such code if i there is a bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  ii we cease to do business  or iii we fail to meet our support obligations 
although we do not believe that we are infringing any proprietary rights of others  third parties may claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights 
furthermore  former employers of our former  current or future employees may assert claims that such employees have improperly disclosed to us the confidential or proprietary information of such former employers 
any such claims  with or without merit  could i be time consuming to defend  ii result in costly litigation  iii divert management s attention and resources  iv cause product shipment delays  and v require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
a successful claim of product infringement against us and our failure or inability to license or create a workaround for such infringed or similar technology may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we license certain software from third parties 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms 
the loss of  or inability to maintain  any of these software licenses could result in shipment delays or reductions 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations involve unique risks 
our revenues are primarily derived from large multinational companies 
to service the needs of these companies  we must provide worldwide product support services 
we have expanded and in the future may expand our international operations and enter additional international markets 
this will require significant management attention and financial resources that could adversely affect our operating margins and earnings 
we may not be able to maintain or increase international market demand for siebel ebusiness applications 
if we do not  our international sales will be limited and our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including i foreign currency fluctuations  ii economic or political instability  iii shipping delays  and iv various trade restrictions 
any of these risks could have a significant impact on our ability to deliver products on a competitive and timely basis 
significant increases in the level of customs duties  export quotas or other trade restrictions could also have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in situations where direct sales or purchases are denominated in foreign currency  any fluctuation in the exchange rate may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
generally  we manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into contracts to sell or purchase foreign currency at the time a foreign currency receivable or payable is generated 
when the foreign currency asset or liability is extinguished  the contract is liquidated  and the resulting gain or loss on the contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated asset or liability 
in certain instances  we have not hedged foreign currency receivables and payables when the forward contracts in the relevant currency were not readily available or were not cost effective 
our current officers  directors and entities affiliated with us may be able to exercise control over matters requiring stockholder approval 
our current officers  directors and entities affiliated with us together beneficially owned a significant portion of the outstanding shares of common stock as of december  while these stockholders do not hold a majority of our outstanding common stock  they will be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers  consolidations and sales of our assets 
this may prevent or discourage tender offers for our common stock 
our stock price may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated substantially since our initial public offering in june the trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in earning estimates by analysts  changes in our revenue and or earnings expectations as announced in our earnings call  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in the domestic and international economic  political and business conditions  general conditions in the software and computer industries  the recent lack of confidence in corporate governance and accounting practices  and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar or related to ours and that have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents may prevent certain corporate actions 
our board of directors is authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further approval by our stockholders 
one of these shares has been designated series a preferred stock  which was issued in connection with the acquisition of janna systems inc  and  shares have been designated as series a junior participating preferred stock  which was authorized in connection with a stockholders rights plan that we implemented in january please refer to notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of the series a preferred stock and series a junior participating preferred stock 
additional shares of preferred stock could be authorized or issued with voting  liquidation  dividend and other rights superior to those of the common stock 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of the series a junior participating preferred stock or the authorization of additional classes of preferred stock by our board of directors in the future  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting common stock 
in addition  the following factors could also delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest i our classified board of directors  ii certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation  iii certain provisions of our bylaws  and iv certain provisions of delaware law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the tables below provide information about our derivative financial instruments and financial instruments that are subject to market risk 
the first table includes our foreign currency contracts used to minimize the impact of changes in currency rates on existing foreign currency receivables  payables and intercompany balances  which are subject to exchange rate risk 
the second table includes our available for sale short term investments  which are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk by entering into contracts to sell or buy foreign currency at the time a foreign currency receivable or payable is generated 
when the foreign currency asset or liability is extinguished  the contract is liquidated  and the resulting gain or loss on the contract mitigates the exchange rate risk of the associated asset or liability
