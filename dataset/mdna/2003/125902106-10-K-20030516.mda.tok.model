application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the company to estimate the effect of various matters that are inherently uncertain as of the date of the financial statements

estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  and would materially impact the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations

self insurance reserves the company is self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  business auto usage and employee medical claims 
the company has stop loss coverages to limit the exposure arising from these claims 
self insurance losses for claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for uninsured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and the company s historical experience 
loss estimates are adjusted based upon actual claims settlements and reported claims 
defined benefit retirement plans the plan obligations and related assets of defined benefit retirement plans are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt instruments  are valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries and through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate  the rate of salary increases and the estimated future return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  the company utilizes the yield on high quality  fixed income investments currently available with maturities corresponding to the anticipated timing of the benefit payments 
salary increase assumptions are based upon historical experience and anticipated future management actions 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at february   the actuarial assumptions of the company s plans were discount rate  long term rate of return on plan assets  and assumed salary increases 
the company has made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding the company s financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of assessing recoverability of the remaining amount due the company resulting from the disposal of its previous wall decor segment and of long lived assets  realization of net deferred tax assets and in establishing reserves in connection with restructuring initiatives and other special charges and with respect to the company s operating lease guarantees related to its former wall decor segment 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments in these areas based on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors 
management s estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect its best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
the company s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management discussion and analysis
