on january  the company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of thompson site selection research  inc thompson  a privately held company headquartered in ann arbor  michigan 
thompson is a provider of location based analytical services and business intelligence software for the retail  restaurant and real estate verticals 
the company expects the acquisition to strengthen its presence in these verticals 
the purchase price was million  including acquisition related costs 
in addition  in accordance with the purchase agreement  thompson may earn up to million in contingent consideration based on thompson s profitability following the acquisition 
on november   based on the operating performance achieved by thompson to date and in order to facilitate the integration of thompson s operations  the company has agreed to pay thompson the full contingent payment  million of which will be paid on march  and the remaining million will be paid on october  these payments will be recorded as an addition to goodwill 
the thompson acquisition was financed with million in cash on hand  million in borrowings under the company s bank credit facility  and thousand in cash on hand  paid in april as a result of the closing balance sheet working capital adjustment 
the total of thompson s net assets acquired by the company was million 
goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition totaled million 
intangibles assets acquired  other than goodwill  totaled million 
the acquisition is being accounted for as a purchase  and  accordingly  the company has included the results of operations in the financial statements effective january  the pro forma effects of the thompson acquisition on the company s financial statements were not material 
ninety three employees of thompson became employees of mapinfo upon the acquisition 
in response to a reduction in spending by telecommunication companies and reduced it spending in most of the company s markets  the company reduced operating expenses during and overall expense reductions included headcount reductions  restructuring of the business model in japan  and the consolidation of the company s canadian operations 
in japan  the company increased its ownership position in february in alps mapping co 
ltd  alps from to  and granted alps exclusive distribution rights in japan to mapinfo s software products

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based on its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
management evaluates these estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  restructuring  contingencies and litigation  on an on going basis 
the estimates are based on historical experience and on various assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
when the basis for carrying values of assets and liabilities are not apparent from other sources  they are determined from these estimates 
the company s actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
the company records reductions to revenue for estimated product returns 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of mapinfo s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  an additional allowance may be recognized 
the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns is based on historical collection and sales returns experience 
in addition  the company reviews the status of the current trade receivables  reserving amounts deemed to pose a material collection or sales return risk 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  and sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued product has occurred  no significant obligations remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the each element 
in general  revenue related to postcontract customer support pcs  including maintenance and technical support  is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
in general  revenue from customer training  consulting  and other services are recognized when the service is performed 
impairment of intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of three to ten years  with the exception of certain trademarks  which have been determined to have an indefinite useful life and therefore are not subject to amortization 
the company reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
management s determination of impairment is made based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
goodwill impairment 
effective october   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company does not amortize goodwill 
the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when a triggering event occurs and writes down goodwill if it is determined that the asset has been impaired 
investments impairment 
mapinfo holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus 
the company records an investment impairment charge when an investment has experienced a decline in value that the company believes is not temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value 
this may require an impairment charge in the future 
deferred tax assets 
at september   we had net deferred tax assets of million  reflecting tax credit carryforwards  net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which reduce taxable income in future years 
we are required to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets 
significant changes in circumstances may require adjustments during interim periods 
our future tax benefits related to foreign tax credits are fully reserved as it is more likely than not that they will not be realized due to their relatively short carryforward periods 
although realization is not assured  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized principally based upon forecasted taxable income generally within the twenty year r d credit and net operating loss carryforward periods  giving consideration to the substantial benefits realized to date through our restructuring program 
the amount of the net deferred tax assets actually realized could vary if there are differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the actual amounts of future taxable income 
if our forecast is determined to no longer be reliable due to uncertain market conditions or improvement in our results of operations does not continue  our long term forecast will require reassessment 
as a result  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances for all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets

in europe  product revenues decreased and revenue from services decreased 
europe was also affected by the slowing in the rate of new customer acquisition  which the company believes is due to an overall reduction in it spending across european markets 
in the asia pacific region  revenues from services increased and product revenues increased

offsetting the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued increase in australia were declines in china and japan of million and thousand  respectively 
the decline in china reflects reduced sales by the company s principal distributor 
in japan  the company changed its distribution model in february by increasing its ownership in alps from to and granted alps exclusive distribution rights in japan to mapinfo s software products

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin

this interpretation requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
variable interest entities that effectively disperse risks will not be consolidated unless a single party holds an interest or combination of interest that effectively recombines risks that were previously dispersed 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december   to variab le interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company is currently assessing the financial impact of fin on its financial statements

outlook issues and risks in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following issues and risks  among others  should be considered in evaluating mapinfo s outlook and future 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued variability of quarterly operating results 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  depending upon factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and new versions of existing products  the ability to reduce expenses or increase revenues at a level sufficient to offset increases in expenses  the level of technology spending  and the activities of competitors 
because a high percentage of the company s expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  minor variations in the timing of orders and shipments can cause significant variations in quarterly operating results 
the company operates with little or no backlog and has no long term contracts  substantially all of its product revenues in each quarter result from software and data licenses issued in that quarter 
accordingly  the company s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and income for any period is necessarily limited 
also  the company could experience reduced rev enues from telecommunications and internet companies as a result of decreased spending in those industries 
potential volatility of stock price 
there has been  and will likely continue to be  significant volatility in the market price of securities of technology companies  including the company 
factors such as announcements of new products by the company or its competitors  litigation involving the company  quarterly fluctuations in the company s financial results or other software companies financial results  shortfalls in the company s actual financial results compared to results previously forecasted by stock market analysts  the company s stock repurchase program  and general conditions in the software industry and conditions in the financial markets could cause the market price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
these market fluctuations may adversely affect the price of the company s common stock 
such a decline could adversely impact the ability of the company to attract and retain employees  acquire other companies or businesses and raise capital 
effects of economic slowdown 
the stock market decline and broad economic slowdown have affected the demand for software products and related services  lengthened sales cycles and decreased technology spending for many of the company s customers and potential customers 
these events have adversely impacted the company s revenues since  particularly in the united states  and could have a material effect on the company in the future  including without limitation  on the company s future revenues and earnings 
new products and technological change 
the mapping software and information business is characterized by extremely rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  and frequent new product introductions 
these conditions require continuous expenditures on product research and development to enhance existing products and to create new products 
the company believes that the timely development of new products and continuing enhancements to existing products is essential to maintain its competitive position in the marketplace 
during recent years  the company began to increasingly focus on its predictive analytics and lbs businesses and introduced a number of new or substantially updated releases of products  including routing j server  targetpro  miaware  mapinfo professional for microsoft sql server and mapinfo discovery 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon customer and market acceptance of these new products and initiatives 
the company s lbs products have achieved a lower acceptance rate than was anticipated 
any failure to achieve increased acceptance of these and other new product offerings could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of new or enhanced products or successfully manage transitions from one product release to the next 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risks associated with international operations 
revenues outside the united states represented approximately of total company revenues in fiscal year the international portion of the company s business is subject to a number of inherent risks  including the difficulties in building and managing international operations  reliance on financial commitments from certain international distributors  difficulties in localizing products and translating documentation into foreign languages  fluctuations in import export duties and quotas  and regulatory  economic  or political changes in international markets 
the company s operating results are also affected by exchange rates 
approximately of the company s revenues in fiscal year were denominated in foreign currencies 
changes in international business conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
intellectual property rights 
the company regards its software as proprietary and attempts to protect it with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret protections  employee and third party non disclosure agreements  patents and other methods of protection 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy certain portions of the company s products  reverse engineer or obtain and use information the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the company s shrink wrap licenses  under which the company licenses its products  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
also  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
any misappropriation of the company s intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringem ent claims against the company in the future with respect to current or future products 
any such assertion could require the company to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
effect of reduced demand and uncertainties in the telecommunications industry 
the telecommunications industry is experiencing continuing consolidation of industry participants 
as a result  the company s operating results could continue to become increasingly dependent on a smaller number of telecommunication customers 
also  continuing declines in capital spending by telecommunications companies may result in a lengthening of customers decision cycles and a reduction in orders 
revenues from telecommunication customers accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal year significant further reductions in orders from the telecommunication industry could have a material adverse effect on mapinfo s operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with cost reduction measures 
during the year ended september   the company restructured its operations  including decreasing headcount on its base business  excluding thompson  by approximately sixty three employees 
during restructuring operations in fiscal year  the company had decreased headcount by approximately ninety employees 
the restructuring and reductions in force could have an adverse impact on the company s business  including its ability to attract and retain customers or employees  and the timing of release of new products and services 
the company cannot provide any assurance that restructuring will achieve the desired financial benefits  nor can the company provide any assurance that the reduction in headcount will not have an adverse impact on its business or future operating results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued competition 
the company encounters significant competition in the market for business mapping systems worldwide 
some of the company s competition may have significant name recognition  as well as substantially greater capital resources  marketing experience  research and development staffs and production facilities than the company 
increased competition may lead to pricing pressures that could adversely affect the company s gross margins 
prices of software in europe and asia are generally higher than in the americas to cover localization costs and higher costs of distribution 
such price uplifts could erode in the future 
reliance on third parties 
the company relies in part on resellers and independent developers for the development of specialized data products that use mapinfo software 
failure by such resellers or independent developers to continue to develop such data products  or changes in the contractual arrangements with such resellers or independent developers  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
prices 
future prices the company is able to obtain for its products may decrease from previous levels depending upon market or competitive pressures or distribution channel factors 
any decrease could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues varies with the mix of technology development and licensing fees  product revenues  services revenues and services utilization rates  as well as with the distribution channel mix 
changes in the revenue mix  including due to an increasing percentage of sales attributable to services  as well as changes in the distribution model  may affect cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues in the future
