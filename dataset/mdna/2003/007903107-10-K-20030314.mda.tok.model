item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes as of december  and december  and for each of the three years in the period ended december   which are included in this annual report 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our investments  allowance for doubtful accounts  revenues  inventories  asset impairments  restructuring charges  income taxes  commitments and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates or the results of our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies relate to those policies that are most important to the presentation of our financial statements and require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
investments in debt and equity securities 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or possessing technology primarily in areas within our strategic focus  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile stock prices 
we also make investments in marketable equity and debt securities 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in determining if a decline in market value below cost for a publicly traded security or debt instrument is other than temporary  we evaluate the relevant market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures providing an indication of the instrument s fair value 
for private equity investments  we evaluate the financial condition of the investee  market conditions  trends of earnings and other key factors that provide indicators of the fair value of the investment 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to interest income and other  net in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other accounts receivable due from customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the current business environment and our historical collection and write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future  resulting in additional charges to our operating results 
revenue reserves 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on actual historical sales returns  allowances and other known factors 
actual returns and allowances could be different from our estimates and current provisions  resulting in future adjustments to our operating results 
inventory valuation 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 

table of contents these projections assist us in determining the carrying value of our inventory  and are also used for near term factory production planning 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand of generally six months or less  are not valued 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
among other factors  management considers forecasted demand in relation to the inventory on hand  competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions and product life cycles when determining obsolescence 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
if in any period we are able to sell inventories that were not valued or that had been written off in a previous period  related revenues would be recorded without any offsetting charge to cost of sales  resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin 
impairment of long lived assets 
we consider no less frequently than quarterly whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
restructuring charges 
we record and account for our restructuring activities following formally approved plans that identify the actions and timeline over which the restructuring activities will occur 
restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee severance and fringe benefit costs  facility exit costs  subleasing assumptions and facility and equipment decommissioning costs resulting from exiting certain facilities 
inherent in these estimates are judgments about employee relation matters  whether employees might leave earlier than expected  complexities associated with abandoning and decommissioning facilities  the amount of sublease income we will receive  if any  and the time period necessary to sublease vacant facilities 
we review remaining restructuring accruals on a quarterly basis and adjust these accruals when changes in facts and circumstances suggest actual amounts will differ from our estimates 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  actual cost may be different than our original or revised estimates 
deferred income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past performance  future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in fiscal  we recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  based on past performance and the likelihood of realization of our deferred tax assets at this time 
if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized  an appropriate amount of the previously provided valuation allowance will be reversed  resulting in a benefit to our earnings 
commitments and contingencies 
from time to time we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions  which arise in the normal course of business 
we are also a party to environmental matters  including local  regional  state and federal governed cleanup activities at or near locations where we currently or have in the past conducted our business 
we are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required for these contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in circumstances  such as a change in settlement strategy 
changes in required reserves could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 

table of contents results of operations in  we operated in two reportable segments the core products segment  which reflects the aggregation of the pc processor  memory products and other ic products operating segments  and the foundry services segment 
our core products segment includes our pc processor products  memory products and other ic products 
pc processor products include our seventh generation microprocessors  the amd athlon and amd duron microprocessors 
memory products include flash memory devices and erasable programmable read only memory eprom devices 
other ic products include platform products  which primarily consist of chipsets  embedded processors  networking products and personal connectivity solutions products 
our foundry services segment consists of fees from legerity  inc and vantis corporation 
in  our voice communications segment consisted of our voice communications products subsidiary  legerity 
the following is a summary of net sales by segment for  and millions core products segment pc processors memory products other ic products foundry services segment voice communications segment total net sales comparison for years ended december  and december  total net sales of  million decreased by percent in compared to pc processors net sales of  million decreased by percent in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in both unit sales and average selling prices  reflecting industry wide weakness in pc sales 
the decrease in unit sales also reflected the execution of our plan to align amd pc processor inventory in the supply chain with forecasted customer demand  reflecting our decision to limit shipments and accept receipt of product returns from certain customers 
we expect pc processor sales in the first quarter of to increase as compared to the fourth quarter of based on sales of higher performance and higher priced products 
increasing pc processor sales levels in depends on our ability to maintain or increase average selling prices for our microprocessors  growth in unit shipments of our pc processors  our ability to introduce in a timely manner and market our amd opteron and amd athlon processors and increasing market acceptance of the newest versions of the amd athlon processors 
memory products net sales of million decreased by percent in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices reflecting continued weakness in the telecommunications and networking equipment industries 
we expect memory products net sales in the first quarter of to remain flat as compared to the fourth quarter of increasing memory products sales levels in depends on the degree of recovery of the telecommunications and networking equipment industries  continued growth in the mobile phone market  especially in high end mobile phones which require larger amounts of flash memory  further penetration of the mobile phone market  and increased market acceptance of our mirrorbit flash memory products 
other ic products net sales of million decreased by percent in compared to the decrease was due to decreased net sales of platform products  embedded processors and networking products as a result of the sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries 
we expect 
table of contents other ic revenues in the first quarter of to continue to decline due to our decision to discontinue manufacturing certain of our embedded processor and networking products 
foundry services segment service fees of million decreased by percent in compared to we expect that foundry services segment service fees will continue to decline in the first quarter of due to the termination of our foundry service arrangement with legerity in the third quarter of  and the termination of the foundry service arrangement with vantis  which represented percent of the total foundry services revenue in  in the third quarter of net sales comparison for years ended december  and december  total net sales decreased by million in  or percent  to  million from  million in pc processors net sales of  million increased by four percent in compared to this increase was primarily due to an increase in unit sales of our amd athlon and amd duron microprocessors  partially offset by a decline in average selling prices 
memory products net sales of  million decreased by percent in compared to the decrease was primarily due to continuing weakness in the communications and networking equipment industries and excess inventories held by major customers 
other ic products net sales of million decreased by percent in compared to the decrease was due to decreased net sales of platform products  embedded processors and networking products as a result of the sustained market declines in the communications and networking equipment industries 
foundry services segment service fees of million decreased by percent in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a significant reduction in demand for wafer fabrication services from vantis  partially offset by an increase in overall service fees from legerity 
there were no sales from voice communications segment in voice communications products contributed million to our net sales  prior to our sale of legerity 
comparison of expenses  gross margin percentage  interest and other income  net and interest expense the following is a summary of expenses  gross margin percentage  and interest and other income  net and interest expense for  and millions except for gross margin percentage cost of sales gross margin percentage research and development marketing  general and administrative restructuring and other special charges gain on sale of legerity interest and other income  net interest expense we operate in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid product development cycles and high fixed costs due to capital intensive manufacturing processes  particularly the costs to build and maintain state of the art production facilities required for pc processors and memory devices 
as a result  our gross margin 
table of contents percentage is significantly affected by new product production costs  product demand and our ability to sell pc processors and memory devices that we manufacture at sustainable average selling prices 
gross margin percentage decreased to percent in compared to percent in this decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of both pc processors and flash memory devices as a result of lower unit demand and average selling prices  partially offset by cost savings realized from the closure of certain facilities pursuant to the restructuring plan discussed below and the reallocation of certain manufacturing resources to research and development activities for new microprocessor products 
gross margin percentage decreased to percent in compared to percent in this decrease was primarily due to decreased sales of all our products caused by lower unit sales and average selling prices for flash memory devices  networking products and embedded processors and lower average selling prices for pc processors 
research and development expenses of million in increased percent compared to this increase was primarily due to the reallocation of manufacturing resources  previously included in costs of goods sold  to research and development activities for new microprocessors 
in addition  research and development expenses in included a million charge for amounts paid to a third party in exchange for product development services provided in connection with a discrete pc processor research and development project in the fourth quarter of research and development expenses and cost of sales in included the recognition of and million of deferred credits on foreign capital grants  interest subsidies and research and development subsidies that were received from the state of saxony for fab in  these credits totaled and million 
in  these credits totaled and million 
research and development expenses of million in increased slightly compared to this slight increase was due to increased costs related to research and development activities for pc processors 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million in increased eight percent compared to primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with the launch of our amd me branding campaign 
marketing  general and administrative expenses of million in increased four percent compared to primarily as a result of increased advertising and marketing expenses associated with our core products and the amd athlon xp processor launch  offset by the absence of legerity expenses during as a result of its sale in in december  we finalized a restructuring plan the plan to align our cost structure to current industry conditions resulting from weak customer demand and industry wide excess inventory 
the plan will result in the reduction of approximately  positions or percent of our employees  affecting all levels of our workforce in almost every organization 
as a result of our agreement with ibm  we are ramping down silicon processing associated with logic research and development in our sdc and will eliminate most of those related resources  including the sale or abandonment of certain equipment used in the sdc 
the plan will also result in the consolidation of facilities  primarily at our sunnyvale  california site and at sales offices worldwide 
we are vacating  and attempting to sublease  certain facilities currently occupied under long term operating leases 
we have also terminated the implementation of certain partially completed enterprise resource planning erp software and other information technology implementation activities  resulting in the abandonment of certain software  hardware and capitalized development costs 
pursuant to the plan  we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of million  consisting primarily of million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs  an asset impairment 
table of contents charge of million relating to a license associated with discontinued logic process development activities that has no future use  asset impairment charges of million resulting from the abandonment of equipment previously used in logic process development and manufacturing activities  anticipated exit costs of million primarily to vacate and consolidate our facilities and million resulting from the abandonment of partially completed erp software and other information technology implementation activities 
we began activities pursuant to the plan during the fourth quarter of  and expect to substantially complete the activities associated with the plan by the end of june as of december   employees were terminated pursuant to the plan resulting in cash payments of million in severance and employee benefit costs 
the following table summarizes activities under the plan through december  severance and employee benefits asset impairment exit costs other restructuring charges total thousands provision q non cash charges q cash charges accruals at december  as a result of the plan  we expect to realize overall cost reductions of million in in  we announced a restructuring plan the plan due to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry  and a resulting decline in revenues 
in connection with the plan  we closed fabs and in austin  texas 
these facilities supported certain of our older products and our foundry service operations  which have been discontinued as part of the plan 
we also reorganized related manufacturing facilities and reduced activities primarily in penang  malaysia along with associated administrative support 
pursuant to the plan  we recorded restructuring costs and other special charges of million  consisting of million of anticipated severance and fringe benefit costs  million and million of anticipated exit costs to close facilities in austin and asia  mostly in penang  and million and million of non cash asset impairment charges in austin and asia  primarily penang 
the asset impairment charges related primarily to buildings and production equipment and have been incurred as a result of our decision to implement the plan 
we substantially completed execution of the plan by the end of as of december    employees had been terminated pursuant to the plan resulting in cash payments of approximately million for severance and employee benefit costs  of which million was included in current year results of operations 
of these positions were associated with closing fabs and the balance of the reductions resulted from reorganizing activities  primarily in penang  malaysia  along with associated administrative support 
in addition  the planned facilities closures had been completed as of december  and related decommissioning costs will be incurred over the next six months

the actions taken to date resulted in actual savings of million in we sold percent of legerity to francisco partners  lp for approximately million in cash  effective july  prior to the sale  legerity was a wholly owned subsidiary of amd  selling voice communications products 
our pre tax gain on the sale of legerity was million 
the gain was computed based on the excess of the consideration received for legerity s net assets as of july   less direct expenses related to the sale 
the applicable tax rate on the gain was percent  resulting in an after tax gain of million 
interest and other income  net  increased million or percent in compared to primarily due to million in charges for other than temporary declines in our equity investments as compared to million in charges in and a decrease of million in interest income as a result of lower interest rates on our investment portfolio and lower average cash balances 
interest expense increased percent in compared to primarily due to interest expense incurred on our million convertible senior debentures due  issued at the end of january  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest associated with conversion of fab to a flash memory facility and facilitization activities at fab and a decrease of interest expenses incurred on our dresden term loans due to a partial repayment of the outstanding balance in interest and other income  net  decreased million or percent in compared to primarily due to million in charges for other than temporary declines in our equity investments  a million decrease in interest income due to a decrease in short term investments and a million decrease due to the absence in of a gain on the sale of real property recorded in interest expense increased slightly in compared to due to a decrease in capitalized interest expense attributable to the substantial completion of fab and increased borrowings by our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  amd saxony limited liability company co 
kg formerly known as amd saxony manufacturing gmbh amd saxony  offset by the effect of redeeming our convertible subordinated notes in may income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in  an income tax benefit of million in and an income tax provision of million in the income tax provision was recorded primarily for taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions 
no tax benefit was recorded in on pre tax losses due to the establishment in the fourth quarter of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  due to the incurrence of continuing substantial operating losses  as required under sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the effective benefit rate of percent for 
table of contents was less than the statutory rate because of a percent tax benefit rate on the restructuring charges  reflecting the allocation of the charges between the us and foreign low taxed jurisdictions  and a provision for us taxes on certain previously undistributed earnings of low taxed foreign subsidiaries 
the effective tax rate was percent for the effective tax rate  excluding the gain on the sale of legerity  was percent  reflecting the benefit of realizing previously reserved deferred tax assets 
the tax rate recorded in attributable to the gain on the sale of legerity was percent 
other items international sales as a percent of net sales were percent in  percent in and percent in during  approximately one percent of our net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
the impact on our operating results from changes in foreign currency rates individually and in the aggregate has not been material  principally as a result of our foreign currency hedging activities

dresden term loans and dresden guarantee amd saxony  an indirect wholly owned german subsidiary of amd  continues to facilitize fab  which began production in the third quarter of amd  the federal republic of germany  the state of saxony and a consortium of banks are providing financing for the project 
we currently estimate that the construction and facilitization costs of fab will be billion when it is fully equipped by the end of as of december   we had invested billion in amd saxony 

table of contents in march  amd saxony entered into a loan agreement and other related agreements the dresden loan agreements with a consortium of banks led by dresdner bank ag  a german financial institution  in order to finance the project 
the dresden loan agreements were amended in february  june  february  june and december because most of the amounts under the dresden loan agreements are denominated in deutsche marks converted to euros  the dollar amounts are subject to change based on applicable exchange rates 
we used the exchange rate that was permanently fixed on january   of deutsche marks to euro for the conversion of deutsche marks to euros  and then used exchange rate of euro to us dollar as of december   to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks into us dollars 
the dresden loan agreements  as amended  provide for the funding of the construction and facilitization of fab this funding consists of equity contributions  subordinated and revolving loans and loan guarantees from  and full cost reimbursement through  amd  loans from a consortium of banks  and grants  subsidies and loan guarantees from the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony 
the dresden loan agreements require that we partially fund fab project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to  or equity investments in  amd saxony 
in accordance with the terms of the dresden loan agreements  as of december   we had provided million of subordinated loans  million of revolving loans and million of equity investments in amd saxony 
these amounts have been eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition to support from amd  the consortium of banks referred to above made available up to million in loans to amd saxony to help fund fab project costs 
the loans have been fully drawn and a portion has been repaid 
amd saxony had million of such loans outstanding as of december   which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
please refer to the contractual cash obligation table  above  for the repayment schedule  which was revised as part of the december amendments to the dresden loan agreements 
finally  pursuant to a subsidy agreement  as amended in august  the federal republic of germany and the state of saxony are supporting the fab project  in accordance with the dresden loan agreements  in the form of guarantees equal to the lesser of percent of amd saxony bank debt or million  capital investment grants and allowances totaling million  and interest subsidies totaling million 
of these amounts  amd saxony received approximately million in capital investment grants and allowances and million in interest subsidies 
in addition  amd saxony received advanced payments for interest subsidies amounting to million  of which approximately million is restricted from our access for more than one year  and is therefore included in other assets 
in addition to the above mentioned subsidies  amd saxony also received million in research and development subsidies through december  amounts received under the subsidy agreement are recorded as a long term liability on our financial statements and are being amortized to operations ratably over the contractual life of the subsidy agreement as a reduction to operating expenses through december of the historical rates were used to translate the amounts denominated in deutsche marks converted to euros into us dollars 

table of contents the subsidy agreement  as amended  imposes conditions on amd saxony  including the requirement to attain a certain employee headcount by december and to maintain such headcount until december noncompliance with the conditions of the grants  allowances and subsidies could result in the forfeiture of all or a portion of the future amounts to be received  as well as the repayment of all or a portion of amounts received to date 
in december  amd saxony reduced its anticipated december employment levels as a result of the restructuring plan see note 
consequently  the anticipated headcount is below the level required to be maintained by the subsidy agreement 
based on these revised headcount estimates  the maximum amount of capital investment grants and allowances available under the subsidy agreement would be reduced from million to million 
we adjusted the quarterly amortization of these amounts accordingly 
there have been no conditions of noncompliance through december  that would result in forfeiture of any of the grants and allowances 
the dresden loan agreements  as amended  also require that we provide interim funding to amd saxony if either the remaining capital investment grants and allowances or the remaining interest subsidies are delayed  such funding to be repaid to amd as amd saxony receives the investment grants and allowances or subsidies from the state of saxony  fund shortfalls in government subsidies resulting from any default under the subsidy agreement caused by amd saxony or its affiliates  and guarantee up to percent of amd saxony s obligations under the dresden loan agreements  which guarantee must not be less than million or more than million  until the bank loans are repaid in full 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the guarantee was million 
as amd saxony s obligations under the dresden loan agreements are included in our consolidated financial statements  no incremental liability is recorded under the dresden guarantee 
amd saxony would be in default under the dresden loan agreements if we  amd saxony or amd saxony holding gmbh amd holding fail to comply with certain obligations thereunder or upon the occurrence of certain events  including material variances from the approved plan and specifications  our failure to fund equity contributions or loans or otherwise comply with our obligations relating to the dresden loan agreements  the sale of shares in amd saxony or amd holding  the failure to pay material obligations  the occurrence of a material adverse change or filings or proceedings in bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us  amd saxony or amd holding  the occurrence of a default under the july loan agreement or the september loan agreement  and noncompliance with specified financial covenants 
generally  any default with respect to borrowings made or guaranteed by amd that results in recourse to us of more than million  and that is not cured by us  would result in a cross default under the dresden loan agreements  the july loan agreement and the september loan agreement 
as of december   we were in compliance with all conditions of the dresden loan agreements 
in the event we are unable to meet our obligations to amd saxony as required under the dresden loan agreements  we will be in default under the dresden loan agreements  the july loan agreement and the september loan agreement  which would permit acceleration of certain indebtedness  which could have a 
table of contents material adverse effect on us 
the occurrence of a default under these agreements would likely result in a cross default under the indentures governing our debentures and notes 
we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain the funds necessary to fulfill these obligations 
any such failure would have a material adverse effect on us 
capital lease obligations as of december   we had capital lease obligations of approximately million 
obligations under these lease agreements are collateralized by the assets leased and are payable through leased assets consist principally of machinery and equipment 
operating leases  unconditional purchase commitments and other operating commitments we lease certain of our facilities  including our executive offices in sunnyvale  california  under lease agreements that expire at various dates through we lease certain of our manufacturing and office equipment for terms ranging from one to five years 
total future lease obligations as of december  were approximately million  of which million was recorded as a liability for certain facilities that were included in our restructuring plan 
we enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing supplies and services 
total purchase commitments as of december  were approximately million for periods through fasl facilities and guarantees fasl  a joint venture formed by amd and fujitsu limited in  operates advanced integrated circuit manufacturing facilities in aizu wakamatsu  japan  to produce flash memory devices 
fasl is continuing the facilitization of its second and third flash memory device wafer fabrication facilities  fasl jv and fasl jv we expect fasl jv and fasl jv  including equipment  to cost approximately billion when fully equipped 
as of december   approximately billion of these costs had been funded by cash generated primarily from fasl operations and borrowings by fasl 
these costs are incurred in japanese yen and are  therefore  subject to change due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
on december   the exchange rate was yen to one us dollar 
we use this rate to translate the amounts denominated in yen into us dollars 
a significant portion of fasl capital expenditures in will continue to be funded by cash generated from fasl operations 
however  to the extent that additional funds are required for the full facilitization of fasl jv and fasl jv  we will be required to contribute cash or guarantee third party loans in proportion to our percent interest in fasl  up to billion yen million 
as of december   we had million in loan guarantees outstanding with respect to these third party loans 
in  fasl further expanded its production capacity through a foundry arrangement with fujitsu microelectronics  inc fmi  a wholly owned subsidiary of fujitsu limited 
in connection with fmi equipping its wafer fabrication facility in gresham  oregon the gresham facility to produce flash memory devices for sale to fasl  we agreed to guarantee the repayment of up to million of fujitsu s obligations as a co signer with fmi under its global multicurrency revolving credit facility the credit facility with a third party bank the fujitsu guarantee 
on november   fujitsu announced that it was closing the gresham facility  due to the downturn of the flash memory market 
to date we have not received notice from fujitsu that fmi has defaulted on any payments due under the credit facility 
fujitsu has requested that we pay the entire million under the fujitsu guarantee 
we continue to disagree with fujitsu as to the amount  if any  of our obligations under the fujitsu guarantee 
while we continue to discuss this matter with fujitsu  we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
accordingly  we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the fujitsu guarantee 

table of contents advanced mask technology center guarantee and bac guarantee the advanced mask technology center gmbh co 
kg amtc and maskhouse building administration gmbh co  kg bac are joint ventures formed by us  infineon technologies ag and dupont photomasks  inc for the purpose of constructing and operating a new advanced photomask facility in dresden  germany 
in june  bac entered into a million bridge loan bridge loan with a consortium of banks led by dresdner bank for the purpose of constructing the facility 
we guaranteed the payment obligations of bac under the bridge loan  in an amount not to exceed million plus interest and expenses 
in december  bac and amtc executed a facility agreement  consisting of a million revolving credit facility revolving loan and a million term loan facility term loan  with a consortium of banks led by dresdner bank 
the term loan will supercede and replace the bridge loan 
we guaranteed the payment obligations of amtc  in an amount not to exceed million plus interest and expenses  under the revolving loan 
in addition  we guaranteed the payment obligations of bac  in an amount not to exceed million plus interest and expenses  under the term loan 
in december  the amtc and bac entered into a rental agreement with respect to the photomask facility 
the rental agreement will become effective upon completion of construction of the photomask facility 
we guaranteed approximately of the payment obligations of amtc under the rental agreement  which we believe will be equal to approximately million  initially and diminish over time through as the term loan is repaid 
our rental guarantee replaces our guarantee of the term loan 
in addition  in the event the other tenant of the photomask facility defaults under its rental agreement  and the amtc assumes the defaulting tenant s lease and related lease obligations  we would be required to guarantee of these additional rental payment obligations 
further  in the event one of the three joint venture partners is unable to meet its guarantee obligations with respect to amtc s additional rental payment obligations  the remaining joint venture partners agreed to assume  on a pro rata basis  the defaulting partner s guarantee obligations with respect to amtc s additional rental payment only 
assuming the other tenant of the photomask facility defaults under the rental agreement and amtc exercises its option to assume the defaulting tenant s obligations under its rental agreement  and assuming a default under the rental guarantee by both infineon and dupont  the maximum potential amount of our guarantee obligations for these rental payments would be approximately million 
as of december   no amounts were drawn under the revolving loan or the term loan and we have not recorded any liability in our consolidated financial statements associated with the guarantees 
other financial activities we plan to make capital investments of approximately million during  including amounts related to the continued facilitization of fab and fab we believe that cash flows from operations and current cash balances  together with available external financing and the extension of existing facilities  will be sufficient to fund operations and capital investments for at least the next months 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the amortization and impairment provisions of sfas are effective upon the adoption of sfas we adopted sfas and sfas at the beginning of these accounting standards did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes both statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  the statement provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset or group of assets to be disposed of other than by sale be classified as held and used until they are disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset or group of assets as held for sale 
sfas also retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
we adopted fas at the beginning of  which had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to sfas s timing for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for an exit cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost  as generally defined in eitf  was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we will adopt sfas prospectively as of december   the beginning of fiscal year  and  therefore  its adoption is not expected to have any impact on our current financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements regarding its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the provisions related to the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements of periods ending after december  the provisions related to recognition and measurement are applicable prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  as required  we have adopted the disclosure provisions in the financial statements for our fiscal year ended december  we are still in the process of assessing fin s recognition and initial measurement requirements  and  at this point  do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  which provides for alternative methods to transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock options in accordance with provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in addition  sfas requires disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
we adopted the annual disclosure provisions of sfas in the financial statements for our fiscal year ended december  and will adopt the interim disclosure requirements beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the transition provisions of sfas are currently not applicable to us as we continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
variable interest entities often are created for a single specified purpose  for example  to facilitate securitization  leasing  hedging  research and development  or other transactions or arrangements 
formerly consolidation of certain special purpose entities in its draft form  this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  defines what these variable interest entities are and provides guidelines on how to identity them and also on how an enterprise should assess its interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
generally  fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
for existing variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february   the provision of this interpretation will apply no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  currently  we do not have any variable interest entities  and we do not expect the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
risk factors we have recently experienced substantial declines in revenues and increases in operating losses  and we may experience additional declines in revenues and increases in operating losses in the future 
our historical financial results have been  and our future financial results are anticipated to be  subject to substantial fluctuations 
our total revenues for were  million compared to  million for this decline was due primarily to reduced demand for our products resulting from the current economic slowdown and our decision primarily in the third and fourth quarters of to limit shipments and to accept receipt of product returns from certain customers  each as part of our efforts to reduce excess pc processor inventory in the overall supply chain 
we incurred a net loss of billion for compared to a net loss of million for reduced end user demand  underutilization of our manufacturing capacity and other factors could adversely affect our business in the near term and we may experience additional declines in revenue and operating losses 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to return to profitability or that  if we do  we will be able to sustain it 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is currently experiencing a severe downturn  that is adversely affecting  and may continue to adversely affect  our business 
the highly cyclical semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns  often in connection with maturing product cycles  manufacturing overcapacity and declines in general economic conditions 
the most recent downturn  which began in the fourth quarter of and continues today  has been severe and prolonged  and future downturns may also be severe and prolonged 
our financial performance has been negatively affected by these downturns  including the incurrence of substantial losses during the current downturn  as a result of the cyclical nature of the supply demand imbalances in the semiconductor industry  a decline in demand for end user products that incorporate our semiconductors  excess inventory levels in the channels of distribution  including our customers  excess production capacity  and accelerated declines in average selling prices 
if current conditions do not improve in the near term or if these conditions in the semiconductor industry occur in the future  as they likely will to a lesser or greater degree  our business will continue to be adversely affected 
fluctuations in the personal computer market may continue to materially adversely affect us 
our business is  and particularly our pc processor product lines are  tied to the personal computer industry 
industry wide fluctuations in the pc marketplace  including the current industry downturn that commenced in and has continued throughout have materially adversely affected us and may materially adversely affect us in the 
table of contents future 
if we continue to experience a sustained reduction in the growth rate of pcs sold  sales of our microprocessors may not grow and may even decrease 
in addition  current trends of consolidation within the personal computer industry  as recently evidenced by the hewlett packard compaq merger  as well as potential market share increases by customers who exclusively purchase microprocessors from intel corporation  such as dell corporation  could further materially adversely affect us 
we plan for significant capital expenditures in and beyond and if we cannot generate the capital required for these capital expenditures and other ongoing operating expenses through operating cash flow and external financing activities  we may be materially adversely affected 
we plan to continue to make significant capital expenditures to support our microprocessor and flash memory products both in the near and long term  including approximately million during these capital expenditures include those relating to the continued facilitization of fab and fab these capital expenditures  together with ongoing operating expenses  will be a substantial drain on our cash flow and will also decrease our cash balances 
the timing and amount of our capital requirements cannot be precisely determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for products  product mix  changes in semiconductor industry conditions and competitive factors 
we regularly assess markets for external financing opportunities including debt and equity 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or  if available  may not be available on satisfactory terms 
in addition  our july loan agreement is scheduled to expire in july our inability to obtain needed debt and or equity financing would have a material adverse effect on us 
in march  amd saxony entered into the dresden loan agreements and other related agreements 
these agreements require that we partially fund fab project costs in the form of subordinated and revolving loans to  or equity investments in  amd saxony 
we currently estimate that the maximum construction and facilitization costs to us of fab will be billion when fully equipped by the end of we had invested billion as of december  if we are unable to meet our obligations to amd saxony as required under these agreements  we will be in default under the dresden loan agreements  which would permit acceleration of million of indebtedness  as well as acceleration by cross default of our obligations under our other borrowing arrangements 
our joint venture with fujitsu limited  fasl  continues to facilitize its manufacturing facilities in aizu wakamatsu  japan  known as fasl jv and fasl jv we expect fasl jv and fasl jv  including equipment  to cost approximately billion when fully equipped 
as of december   approximately billion of this cost had been funded 
to the extent that additional funds are required for the full facilitization of fasl jv and fasl jv  we will be required to contribute cash or guarantee third party loans in proportion to our percent interest in fasl 
we have a substantial amount of debt and debt service obligations  and may incur additional debt  that could adversely affect our financial position 
we have a substantial amount of debt and we may incur additional debt in the future 
at december   our total debt was billion and stockholders equity was billion 
in addition  we had up to million of availability under our july loan agreement subject to our borrowing base 
we had also guaranteed approximately million of debt  and we are currently in disagreement as to the amount we owe  if any  under our additional guarantee to repay up to million to fujitsu in connection with a closed wafer fabrication facility in gresham  oregon 
none of these guaranteed amounts are reflected as debt on our balance sheet 
our high degree of leverage may limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or other general corporate purposes  require a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments  
table of contents limit our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business and industry  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors  and increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions and  to the extent of our outstanding debt under our september loan agreement  the impact of increases in interest rates 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt or our guarantees of other parties debts will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow or that we will be able to borrow funds under our credit facilities in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt  or meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements or that we will be able to extend the july loan agreement 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to borrow sufficient funds to service our debt  due to borrowing base restrictions or otherwise  we may be required to sell assets  reduce capital expenditures  refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance our debt  sell assets or borrow more funds on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
intense competition in the integrated circuit industry may materially adversely affect us 
the integrated circuit industry is intensely competitive 
products compete on performance  quality  reliability  price  adherence to industry standards  software and hardware compatibility  marketing and distribution capability  brand recognition and availability 
after a product is introduced  costs and average selling prices normally decrease over time as production efficiency improves  competitors enter the market and successive generations of products are developed and introduced for sale 
failure to reduce our costs on existing products or to develop and introduce  on a cost effective and timely basis  new products or enhanced versions of existing products with higher margins  would have a material adverse effect on us 
intel corporation s dominance of the pc processor market may limit our ability to compete effectively in that market 
intel has dominated the market for microprocessors used in pcs for many years 
as a result  intel has been able to control x microprocessor and pc system standards and dictate the type of products the market requires of intel s competitors 
in addition  the financial strength of intel allows it to market its product aggressively  to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to discipline customers who do business with us 
these aggressive activities can result in lower unit sales and average selling prices for us and adversely affect our margins and profitability 
intel also exerts substantial influence over pc manufacturers and their channels of distribution through the intel inside brand program and other marketing programs 
as long as intel remains in this dominant position  we may be materially adversely affected by its pricing and allocation strategies and actions  product mix and introduction schedules  product bundling  marketing and merchandising strategies  control over industry standards  pc manufacturers and other pc industry participants  including motherboard  chipset and basic input output system bios suppliers  and user brand loyalty 
we expect intel to maintain its dominant position in the marketplace as well as to continue to invest heavily in research and development  new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies 
intel has substantially greater financial resources than we do and accordingly expends substantially greater amounts on research and development than we do 
in marketing our microprocessors to oems and dealers  we depend on third party companies other than intel for the design and manufacture of core logic chipsets  graphics chips  motherboards  bios software and 
table of contents other components 
in recent years  many of these third party designers and manufacturers have lost significant market share to intel or exited the business 
in addition  these companies produce chipsets  motherboards  bios software and other components to support each new generation of intel s microprocessors  and intel has significant leverage over their business opportunities 
our microprocessors are not designed to function with motherboards and chipsets designed to work with intel microprocessors 
our ability to compete with intel in the market for amd athlon and amd opteron microprocessors will depend on our ability to ensure that pc platforms are designed to support our microprocessors 
a failure of the designers and producers of motherboards  chipsets and other system components to support our microprocessor offerings would have a material adverse effect on us 
if we are unable to develop  produce and successfully market higher performing microprocessor products  we may be materially adversely affected 
the microprocessor market is characterized by short product life cycles and migration to ever higher performance microprocessors 
to compete successfully  we must transition to new process technologies at a fast pace and offer higher performance microprocessors in significantly greater volumes 
if we fail to achieve yield and volume goals or to offer higher performance microprocessors in significant volume on a timely basis and at competitive prices  we could be materially adversely affected 
to be successful  we must increase sales of our microprocessor products to existing customers and develop new customers in both consumer and commercial markets  particularly the latter 
our production and sales plans for microprocessors are subject to other risks and uncertainties  including our ability to continue offering new higher performance microprocessors competitive with intel s product offerings  our ability to introduce and create successful marketing positions for the upcoming amd opteron and amd athlon microprocessors  which rely in part on market acceptance and demand for bit microprocessors based on x technology 
our ability to maintain and improve the successful marketing position of the amd athlon xp microprocessor  which relies in part on market acceptance of a metric based on overall processor performance versus processor clock speed measured in megahertz frequency  our ability to maintain adequate selling prices of microprocessors despite increasingly aggressive intel pricing strategies  marketing programs  new product introductions and product bundlings of microprocessors  motherboards and chipsets  our ability  on a timely basis  to produce microprocessors in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers  the pace at which we expect to be able to convert production in fab to nanometer copper interconnect process  our ability to attract and retain engineering and design talent  our ability to expand system design capabilities  and the availability and acceptance of motherboards and chipsets designed for our microprocessors 
our ability to increase microprocessor product revenues and benefit fully from the substantial investments we have made and continue to make related to microprocessors depends on the continuing success of our amd athlon microprocessors and the success of future generations of microprocessors  most immediately the amd opteron processor  and later this year the amd athlon processor 
if we fail to achieve continued and expanded market acceptance of our microprocessors  we may be materially adversely affected 
we must introduce in a timely manner  and achieve market acceptance for  our amd opteron and amd athlon microprocessors  or we will be materially adversely affected 
we plan to ship our amd opteron 
table of contents processors in april and our amd athlon processors in september these processors are designed to provide high performance for both bit and bit applications in servers and in desktop and mobile pcs 
the success of these processors is subject to risks and uncertainties including our ability to produce them in a timely manner on new process technologies  including silicon on insulator technology  in the volume and with the performance and feature set required by customers  their market acceptance  the availability  performance and feature set of motherboards and chipsets designed for our eighth generation processors  and the support of the operating system and application program providers for our bit instruction set 
if we were to lose microsoft corporation s support for our products  our ability to market our processors would be materially adversely affected 
our ability to innovate beyond the x instruction set controlled by intel depends on support from microsoft in its operating systems 
if microsoft does not provide support in its operating systems for our x instruction sets  including our x technology that will be introduced with our amd athlon and amd opteron processors  independent software providers may forego designing their software applications to take advantage of our innovations 
if we fail to retain the support and certification of microsoft  our ability to market our processors could be materially adversely affected 
the completion and impact of our restructuring program and cost reductions could adversely affect us 
on november   we announced that we were formulating the restructuring plan to address the continuing industry wide weakness in the semiconductor industry by adjusting our cost structure to industry conditions 
pursuant to the restructuring plan  we intend to reduce our fixed costs as a percentage of total costs over time from approximately percent to approximately percent 
we also expect to reduce our expenses by approximately million per quarter by the second quarter of as a result  we expect total expenses in to be reduced by approximately million based on current product demand forecasts 
we cannot  however  be sure that the goals of the restructuring plan will be realized 
the ultimate effects of the restructuring plan could prove to be adverse 
weak market demand for our flash memory products  the loss of a significant customer in the high end mobile telephone market  or any difficulty in our transition to mirrorbit technology may have a material adverse effect on us 
the demand for flash memory devices has been weak due to the sustained downturn in the communications and networking equipment industries and excess inventories held by our customers 
in the third and fourth quarters of this year  our flash memory product sales grew almost entirely based on strength in the high end mobile phone market 
our sales in that market are concentrated in a few customers 
in addition  we expect competition in the market for flash memory devices to continue to increase as competing manufacturers introduce new products and industry wide production capacity increases 
we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share in flash memory devices as the market develops and intel and other competitors introduce new competing products 
a decline in unit sales of our flash memory devices  lower average selling prices  or a loss of a significant customer in the high end mobile phone market  would have a material adverse effect on us 
in july  we commenced production shipments of our first product with mirrorbit technology 
our mirrorbit technology is a new memory cell architecture that enables flash memory products to hold twice as much data as standard flash memory devices 
a lack of customer acceptance  any substantial difficulty in transitioning our flash memory products to mirrorbit technology or any future process technology could reduce our ability to be competitive in the market and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we rely on our joint venture with fujitsu  fasl  and if that joint venture is terminated or amended significantly  we could be materially adversely affected 
we continue to rely on our joint venture with fujitsu  fasl  to manufacture our flash memory devices 
in addition  beginning in  fab began operating as a foundry to fasl and as of year end  fab was devoted entirely to flash memory device production for fasl 
while the fasl joint venture has been successful to date  there can be no assurance that we and fujitsu will elect to continue the joint venture in its current form  in some other form or at all  which could have a material adverse affect on us 

table of contents our memory products are based on the nor architecture and a significant market shift to the nand architecture could materially adversely affect us 
our memory products are based on the nor architecture  and any significant shift in the marketplace to products based on the nand architecture will reduce the total market available to us and therefore reduce our market share  which could have a materially adverse affect on us 
worldwide economic and political conditions may affect demand for our products and slow payment by our customers 
the economic slowdown in the united states and worldwide  exacerbated by the occurrence and threat of terrorist attacks and consequences of sustained military action  has adversely affected demand for our microprocessors  flash memory devices and other integrated circuits 
a continued decline of the worldwide semiconductor market or a significant decline in economic conditions in any significant geographic area would likely decrease the overall demand for our products  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
if the economic slowdown continues or worsens as a result of terrorist activities  military action or otherwise  it could adversely impact our customers ability to pay us in a timely manner 
manufacturing capacity utilization rates may adversely affect us 
at times we underutilize our manufacturing facilities as a result of reduced demand for certain of our products 
we are substantially increasing our manufacturing capacity by making significant capital investments in fab  fab  fasl jv and our test and assembly facility in suzhou  china 
if the increase in demand for our products is not consistent with our expectations  we may underutilize our manufacturing facilities  and we could be materially adversely affected 
this has in the past had  and in the future may have  a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flow 
there may also be situations in which our manufacturing facilities are inadequate to meet the demand for certain of our products 
our inability to obtain sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand  either in our own facilities or through foundry or similar arrangements with others  could have a material adverse effect on us 
further  during periods when we are implementing new process technologies  our manufacturing facilities may not be fully productive 
a substantial delay in the technology transitions in fab to smaller than nanometer process technologies employing silicon on insulator technology could have a material adverse effect on us 
at this time  the most significant risk is underutilization of our manufacturing capacity 
unless we maintain manufacturing efficiency  our future profitability could be materially adversely affected 
manufacturing semiconductor components involves highly complex processes that require advanced equipment 
we and our competitors continuously modify these processes in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
impurities or other difficulties in the manufacturing process can lower yields 
our manufacturing efficiency will be an important factor in our future profitability  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our manufacturing efficiency or increase manufacturing efficiency to the same extent as our competitors 
from time to time  we have experienced difficulty in beginning production at new facilities  transferring production to other facilities  and in effecting transitions to new manufacturing processes that have caused us to suffer delays in product deliveries or reduced yields 
we cannot be sure that we will not experience manufacturing problems in achieving acceptable yields or product delivery delays in the future as a result of  among other things  capacity constraints  construction delays  transferring production to other facilities  upgrading or expanding existing facilities or changing our process technologies  which could result in a loss of future revenues 
our results of operations could also be adversely affected by the increase in fixed costs and operating expenses related to increases in production capacity if revenues do not increase proportionately 
we cannot be certain that our substantial investments in research and development of process technologies will lead to improvements in technology and equipment used to fabricate our products or that we will have sufficient resources to invest in the level of research and development that is required to remain competitive 
we make substantial investments in research and development of process technologies in an effort 
table of contents to improve the technologies and equipment used to fabricate our products 
for example  the successful development and implementation of silicon on insulator technology is critical to our amd opteron and amd athlon microprocessors 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to develop or obtain or successfully implement leading edge process technologies needed to fabricate future generations of our products profitably 
further  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to maintain the level of investment in research and development that is required for us to remain competitive 
if our microprocessors are not compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware  we could be materially adversely affected 
our microprocessors may not be fully compatible with some or all industry standard software and hardware 
further  we may be unsuccessful in correcting any such compatibility problems in a timely manner 
if our customers are unable to achieve compatibility with software or hardware after our products are shipped in volume  we could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the mere announcement of an incompatibility problem relating to our products could have a material adverse effect on us 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business 
our july loan agreement and our september loan agreement contain restrictive covenants and also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests when our net domestic cash is below specified amounts  and the dresden loan agreements imposes restrictive covenants on amd saxony  including a prohibition on its ability to pay dividends 
our ability to satisfy the covenants  financial ratios and tests of our debt instruments can be affected by events beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that we will meet those requirements 
a breach of any of these covenants  financial ratios or tests could result in a default under our july loan agreement  our september loan agreement and or the dresden loan agreements 
the occurrence of an event of default under any of these agreements or under the indentures governing our debentures and our notes would likely result in a cross default under the agreements covering the other borrowings and would permit the applicable lenders or noteholders to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable and would permit the lenders to terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders under the july loan agreement  the september loan agreement and the dresden loan agreements could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
we have pledged substantially all of our personal property  including inventory and accounts receivable  as security under our july loan agreement  and certain property  plant and equipment as security under our september loan agreement  and amd saxony has pledged substantially all of its property as security under the dresden loan agreements 
if the lenders under any of the credit facilities or the noteholders or the trustee under the indentures governing our debentures and our notes accelerate the repayment of borrowings  we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings and our other indebtedness 
costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us 
one or more of our products may be found to be defective after the product has been shipped to customers in volume 
the cost of a recall  software fix  product replacements and or product returns may be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  modifications needed to fix the defect may impede performance of the product 
if essential raw materials are not available to manufacture our products  we could be materially adversely affected 
certain raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products are available from a limited number of suppliers 
interruption of supply or increased demand in the industry could cause shortages and price increases in various essential materials 
if we are unable to procure certain of these materials  we might have to reduce our manufacturing operations 
such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on us 
our operations in foreign countries are subject to political and economic risks  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
nearly all product assembly and final testing of our products are performed at our manufacturing facilities in malaysia  thailand  china and singapore  or by subcontractors in the united states 
table of contents and asia 
we also depend on foreign foundry suppliers and joint ventures for the manufacture of a portion of our finished silicon wafers and have international sales operations 
the political and economic risks associated with our operations in foreign countries include expropriation  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  difficulty in protecting our intellectual property  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and currency controls  changes in freight and interest rates  disruption in air transportation between the united states and our overseas facilities  and loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
as part of our business strategy  we are continuing to seek expansion of product sales in emerging overseas markets 
expansion into emerging overseas markets presents similar political and economic risks as described above  and we may be unsuccessful in our strategy to penetrate these emerging overseas markets 
our inability to continue to attract and retain key personnel may hinder our product development programs 
our future success depends upon the continued service of numerous key engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales and executive personnel 
if we are not able to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel necessary for our business  the progress of our product development programs could be hindered  and we could be otherwise adversely affected 
our operating results are subject to substantial seasonal fluctuations 
our operating results tend to vary seasonally 
for example  our revenues are generally higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter of each year 
this seasonal pattern is largely a result of decreased demand in europe during the summer months and higher demand in the retail sector of the pc market during the winter holiday season 
in recent quarters  a substantial portion of our quarterly sales have been made in the last month of the quarter 
uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of  and payment for  our products could materially adversely affect us 
our sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders  and we generally do not have long term supply arrangements with our customers 
generally  our customers may cancel orders days prior to shipment without incurring a significant penalty 
we base our inventory levels on customers estimates of demand for their products  which is difficult to predict 
this difficulty may be compounded when we sell to original equipment manufacturers indirectly through distributors  as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties 
in addition  our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason 
the cancellation or deferral of product orders  the return of previously sold products or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory  which could result in write downs of inventory 
during  the markets in which our customers operate were characterized by a decline in end user demand which reduced visibility of future demand for our products and resulted in high levels of inventories in the pc industry supply chain 
in some cases  this led to delays in payments for our products 
we believe that these and other factors could continue to materially adversely affect our revenues in the near term 
our price protection obligations and return rights under specific provisions in our agreements with distributors may adversely affect us 
distributors typically maintain an inventory of our products 
in most 
table of contents instances  our agreements with distributors protect their inventory of our products against price reductions  as well as products that are slow moving or have been discontinued 
these agreements  which may be canceled by either party on a specified notice  generally allow for the return of our products 
the price protection and return rights we offer to our distributors could materially adversely affect us if distributors exercise these rights as a result of an unexpected significant decline in the price of our products or otherwise 
if we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property  in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures  we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses 
we may not be able to adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property  in the united states and abroad  through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and other measures 
any patent licensed by us or issued to us could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or rights granted thereunder may not provide a competitive advantage to us 
further  patent applications that we file may not be issued 
despite our efforts to protect our rights  others may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our patents and other rights 
in addition  it is difficult to cost effectively monitor compliance with  and enforce  our intellectual property on a worldwide basis 
from time to time  we have been notified that we may be infringing intellectual property rights of others 
if any such claims are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under the third party s intellectual property rights 
we cannot assure you that all necessary licenses can be obtained on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we could decide  in the alternative  to resort to litigation to challenge such claims 
such challenges could be extremely expensive and time consuming and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we cannot assure you that litigation related to the intellectual property rights of us and others will always be avoided or successfully concluded 
failure to comply with any of the applicable environmental regulations could result in a range of consequences including fines  suspension of production  alteration of manufacturing process  cessation of operations or sales  and criminal and civil liabilities 
existing or future regulations could require us to procure expensive pollution abatement or remediation equipment  to modify product designs  or to incur other expenses associated with compliance with environmental regulations 
any failure to control the use of  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances could subject us to future liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may materially adversely affect us 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or customers 
furthermore  these attacks may make travel and the transportation of our products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our sales 
also as a result of terrorism  the united states may be included in armed conflicts that could have a further impact on our sales  our supply chain  and our ability to deliver products to our customers 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact our business 
the consequences of armed conflicts are unpredictable  and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our business or your investment 
more generally  any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they also could result in or exacerbate economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future prices of our securities 
our corporate headquarters  assembly and research and development activities are located in an earthquake zone and these operations could be interrupted in the event of an earthquake 
our corporate 
table of contents headquarters  assembly operations in california and research and development activities related to process technologies are located near major earthquake fault lines 
in the event of a major earthquake  we could experience business interruptions  destruction of facilities and or loss of life  all of which could materially adversely affect us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in order to reduce this interest rate risk  we usually invest our cash in investments with short maturities 
as of december   substantially all of our investments in our portfolio were short term investments and they consisted primarily of money market funds  short term corporate notes  short term money market auction rate preferred stocks and short term federal agency notes 
the majority of our debt obligations are fixed rate and long term 
we continually monitor market conditions and enter into hedges when appropriate 
we do not currently have any hedges of interest rate risk in place 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
default risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
as stated in our investment policy  we are averse to principal loss and ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we use proceeds from debt obligations primarily to support general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and working capital needs

we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency exposures in our foreign sales subsidiaries  on liabilities for products purchased from fasl and amd saxony and for foreign currency denominated fixed asset purchase commitments 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results and on the cost of capital asset acquisitions 
our accounting policy for these instruments is based on our designation of such instruments as hedges of underlying exposure to variability in cash flows 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
we had an aggregate of million notional amount of short term foreign currency forward contracts and option contracts denominated in japanese yen  european union euro and singapore dollar outstanding as of december  unrealized gains and losses related to the foreign currency forward and option contracts for the year ended december  were not material 
we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the future 
however  we cannot give any assurance that these strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately
