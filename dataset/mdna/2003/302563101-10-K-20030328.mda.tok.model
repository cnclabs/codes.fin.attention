critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to income taxes  loss and loss adjustment expense lae reserves  contingencies and litigation 
we generally base our estimates on historical experience or other appropriate assumptions that we believe are reasonable and relevant under the circumstances 
the results of these estimation processes form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets 
we have made acquisitions in the past that included significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under gaap in effect through december   we amortized these assets with charges to income over their estimated useful lives  and tested them periodically to determine if they were recoverable from operating earnings on the basis of an estimate of undiscounted cash flows over their useful lives 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standard no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized through charges to income  but do continue to be subject to annual or under certain circumstances more frequent impairment testing based on estimated fair values 
other intangible assets that meet certain criteria continue to be amortized over their useful lives and will also be subject to impairment testing based on estimated fair values 
during the first quarter of  we performed transitional impairment testing required under the new standard and took a charge in the form of a cumulative effect of accounting change for million  net of tax effects  as of the beginning of the year 
loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we estimate our liability for losses and lae loss and lae reserves using actuarial techniques and projections of the amounts of ultimate losses and lae for each period 
we also integrate other quantitative and qualitative analyses of conditions into our actuarial analysis that we expect to affect the future development of claims and related expenses 
our loss and lae reserves comprise the largest liability and most significant estimate or compilation of estimates in our financial statements 
furthermore  our loss and lae reserves are subject to significant inherent uncertainties and so there can be no assurance as to whether the actual results will be higher or lower than these estimates 
any adjustments or changes for such differences will almost certainly be material  especially to our operating results for a period 
as our loss and lae reserves are re estimated  changes to those estimates and our carried reserves  if any  are recognized as a charge or credit to income  as the case may be  in the financial statements for the most recent period presented 
with regard to our core medical professional liability mpl business  which is written primarily on the claims made policy form  the estimated liability for losses and lae is basically comprised of our reserves on individual reported losses case reserves  plus provisions for case reserve development and incurred but not reported ibnr reserves to arrive at our best estimate of what our losses and lae will be once all cases are settled 
these provisions are negative  in aggregate  or a net reduction from the sum total of our individual case reserve estimates for most years 
this is because our case loss reserves have historically developed downward  in aggregate  from the time they become fully established to the time they are settled and we expect this trend to continue 
our core claims made policies do not have ibnr losses  as do traditional occurrence based property and casualty insurance policies 
we do estimate and set aside ibnr for lae  tail coverage and covered extended reporting endorsements issued in the event of death  disability or retirement of claims made insureds 
we also have ibnr loss reserves on some of the direct mpl business we wrote in recent years and on our assumed reinsurance where the coverage is occurrence based 
for the purposes of setting aside reserves on risks insured during the most recent year  including interim periods  for which very little experience is present  forecasted loss ratios were applied to earned premiums during the interim periods 
the forecasted loss ratios were judgmentally determined taking into account the results of the most recent actuarial studies performed  current pricing and underwriting  expected loss and lae trends and other pertinent considerations 
in addition  we monitored and analyzed key loss and lae indicators and trends throughout the year 
these included paid losses  newly reported claims and incidents  closed claim activity and other metrics 
these indicators were taken into account in assessing the reasonableness of our loss reserve estimates throughout the year and the forecasted loss and lae ratios applied during each interim period 
reinsurance 
reinsurance recoverables are the balances due for paid and unpaid losses and lae that will be recovered from reinsurers  based on contracts in force 
we estimate the amounts recoverable from reinsurers in a manner consistent with our estimates for the underlying claim liabilities that we reinsured 
reinsurance does not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk with respect to the individual reinsurers that participate in our ceded programs to minimize our exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
we hold collateral in the form of letters of credit or trust accounts for amounts recoverable from reinsurers that are not designated as authorized reinsurers by the domiciliary departments of insurance 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which would impact our financial position and results of operations 
no such valuation allowance has been established to date  as we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
commitments and contingencies 
liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition 
premium income  which is our main source of revenue  is generally recognized pro rata over the respective period of each policy 
premium receivables are recorded net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
some of our assumed reinsurance agreements with physicians recipricol insurers pri contain adjustable premiums based upon loss experience and our financial statements include estimated adjustments accrued through the end of the reporting period corresponding with our loss experience under these agreements for the period 
management fees of the reciprocal management segment  determined as a percentage of pri s premiums  are recognized as billed and earned under the contract  which generally corresponds with the reported premiums written of pri  net of an estimate for premium refunds  for the calendar year 
such management fees are estimated  billed and earned for quarterly reporting purposes based upon semi annual estimates of the reported premiums written of pri rather than actual written premiums for a quarter  which may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this convention is used so that management fees are recognized more ratably over the period in relation to the services provided by the reciprocal management segment to pri 
general fpic insurance group  inc fpic was formed in through a reorganization the reorganization in which it became the parent company of florida physicians insurance company  inc florida physicians and mccreary corporation mccreary  a third party administrator 
under the reorganization  florida physicians shareholders became the shareholders of fpic and received five shares of fpic common stock for each share of florida physicians common stock 
in may  we changed the name of florida physicians to first professionals insurance company  inc first professionals 
in january  mccreary was merged into its subsidiary  employers mutual  inc emi  with emi continuing as the surviving entity 
we have three main operating segments insurance  reciprocal management and third party administration tpa 
fpic s primary sources of revenue are management fees and dividends from its subsidiaries 
the main sources of revenue for these amounts are premiums earned and investment income insurance segment and claims administration and management fees and commission income reciprocal management and tpa segments 
our insurance segment specializes in professional liability insurance products and services for physicians  dentists  other healthcare providers and attorneys 
on october   interlex entered into an agreement with an unrelated insurance organization to sell the renewal rights to all of its legal professional liability policies 
the reciprocal management segment contains our subsidiary administrators for the professions afp  which serves as the exclusive manager and attorney in fact for pri  an insurance reciprocal in new york 
we do not own pri and so its financial statements are not consolidated or included in ours 
instead  pri is similar to a mutual insurer and the risks and rewards of ownership basically vest with the policyholders of pri 
the reciprocal management segment also provides brokerage  administration and intermediary services for insurance and reinsurance programs to pri and fpic 
our tpa segment markets and administers self insured plans for both large and small employers  including group accident and health  workers compensation and general liability and property insurance 
our financial position and results of operations are subject to fluctuations due to a variety of factors and our historical results of operations are not necessarily indicative of future earnings 
results of operations overview twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december  for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our net loss for includes a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change related to the adoption of fas on goodwill and other intangible assets million pre tax 
the transitional impairment charges  resulting from the adoption of fas  were associated entirely with our non insurance segments 
our income before the cumulative effect of accounting change was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our total revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenues is primarily the result of price improvements on our core mpl business and growth in the number of policyholders 
net premiums earned on our mpl business increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues earned by our reciprocal management segment increased million primarily as the result of an increase in claims administration and management fees earned 
in addition  brokerage commissions earned by fpic intermediaries  inc intermediaries also increased when compared with the prior year 
our total expenses for the year ended december  increased less than to million from million for the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred for the year ended december  increased million or when compared with the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred on our mpl business increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred in were also reduced by losses and lae incurred of million  which was ceded under the hannover re reinsurance agreement 
the increase in net losses and lae incurred for the year ended december   reflects the growth in our business  taking into consideration expected loss trends 
the increases in total expenses were offset primarily by ceding commissions related to the hannover re finite reinsurance agreement and our adoption of fas the adoption of fas eliminated amortization expense of approximately million for the year ended december  one of the most significant financial developments for us in was our new finite reinsurance agreement with hannover re 
it is supplemental to our other reinsurance programs and represents a very large additional reinsurance cession for us 
the following table summarizes the effects of the hannover re agreement on our condensed consolidated income statement and balance sheet accounts 
these pro forma condensed consolidated financial statements are non gaap presentations and are not intended to serve as a substitute for our audited consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere 
instead  this presentation is intended to help discern the impact of the hannover re agreement in the context of the overall trends in our reported operating results and financial position for discussed elsewhere

improved pricing and growth in policyholders during generated significant top line growth 
total revenues for the year ended december  increased  to million  from million for the year ended december  annual revenue growth was driven primarily by growth in earned premiums  which contributed million to such growth 
significant improvements in pricing and the addition of mpl policyholders  primarily in florida and missouri  were the primary source of premium growth 
commission income and claims administration and management fees earned by our non insurance subsidiaries in new york and florida also grew  contributing million to the growth in total revenues 
the growth in total revenues during was offset by a million decline in investment income as a result of lower market yields 
total expenses for the year ended december  increased  to million  from million for the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred for the year ended december  increased million or  over the prior year 
excluding the prior year portions of pre tax reserve charges in and of million and million  respectively  net losses and lae incurred increased million  or during the year the increase reflects growth and the continuation of our policy to maintain our reserves at a conservative level 
other underwriting expenses also contributed to the increase in total expenses  primarily as a result of enhancements made to our financial and reporting systems and an increase in operating expenses related to growth in business 
offsetting the increases in expenses was a reduction in the allowance for bad debts of million 
insurance segment our insurance segment is made up of our four insurance subsidiaries  first professionals  anesthesiologists professional assurance company apac and the tenere group  inc tenere companies  intermed insurance company and interlex insurance company 
fpic operations are also included in the insurance segment due to its size and prominence and the substantial attention the holding company devotes to the segment 
effective october   we sold the renewal rights on interlex s legal professional liability insurance business to a subsidiary of professionals direct  inc  a non affiliate  for million 
the sale of interlex s renewal rights allows us to re dedicate interlex s capital to our core mpl business 
financial and selected other data of our insurance segment for the years ended december   and is summarized in the table below

first professionals implemented rate increases in january and december  and again in december  apac implemented rate increases in july and  and intermed implemented rate increases in november and july we also experienced growth in direct premiums written under fronting arrangements for workers compensation business of million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the growth in direct premiums written was partially offset by a decline of million in group accident and health a h programs for the year ended december   which were discontinued in november of direct and assumed premiums written increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  excluding the effects of the non recurring portion of assumed premiums under the quota share reinsurance agreement written in the first quarter of between our insurance subsidiaries and pri and the effects of the decline in premiums written under a h programs of million  direct and assumed premiums written increased approximately million or 
the increase in direct and assumed premiums written is due to the effect of rate increases and growth in new business in our core mpl lines  and growth in premiums written under fronting arrangements 
the growth in direct premiums written was partially offset by declines in other mpl assumed premiums written 
under the quota share reinsurance agreement with pri  we assumed the death  disability and retirement dd r risks under pri s claims made insurance policies and recognized assumed premiums written  net of a deferred credit  of approximately million 
net premiums written decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in net premiums written is related to the finite quota share reinsurance agreement effective july  between our largest subsidiary  first professionals  and hannover re 
under the terms of the hannover re agreement  we ceded approximately million of our unearned premiums  and million of our direct written premiums  net of other reinsurance 
the agreement  which calls for first professionals to cede quota share portions of its and written premiums  contains adjustable features  including a loss corridor  sliding scale ceding commissions and a cap on the amount of losses that may be ceded to the reinsurer 
the effect of these features is to limit the reinsurers aggregate exposure to loss and reduce the ultimate costs of this reinsurance to first professionals as the ceding company 
these features also have the effect of reducing the amount of protection relative to the quota share amount of premiums ceded by first professionals 
while first professionals does not receive pro rata protection relative to the amount of premiums ceded  the amount of reinsurance protection is significant  as determined in accordance with guidance under both gaap and statutory accounting practices 
in addition to ceding a significant portion of our risks to hannover re  the agreement also allows us to reduce our financial leverage and to realize immediate reimbursement for our up front acquisition costs  which  in turn  lessens the strain on our capital 
net premiums earned increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net premiums earned is due to rate increases that we implemented and growth in the number of policyholders 
net premiums earned on our mpl business increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net premiums earned increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in net premiums earned is less than the increase in direct and assumed premiums written for the same period primarily due to the inherent lag between written and earned premiums 
in addition  as noted above  direct premiums written include premiums written under fronting agreements for which a relatively small portion of business is retained and therefore only a small portion of premium is ultimately earned 
the increase in net premiums earned is due to growth in the number of policyholders and the effects of rate increases instituted by our insurance subsidiaries during partially offsetting this increase was a decline in a h premiums earned of  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  net investment income declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in net investment income is primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates and reduced yields on fixed income investments  beginning in the second half of we also continued to hold significant funds in short term invested cash in anticipation of possible improvements in fixed income rates rather than committing those funds to longer term investments at historically low yields 
on a consolidated basis  our total cash and investments grew to million in  up million or from million in once again  the effects of historically low yields have been offset at least to some extent by growth in cash and invested assets 
net investment income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in net investment income is primarily due to lower prevailing interest rates in fixed income securities 
the effects of lower yields were offset to some degree by growth in cash and invested assets resulting from growth in insurance premiums 
on a consolidated basis  our total cash and investments grew to million in  up million or  from million in net realized investment gains increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our investment strategy remains focused on high quality  fixed income securities held for the long term  however  certain securities may be liquidated from time to time in order to reposition the portfolio or to take advantage of current market and economic conditions 
the increase in net realized investment gains in is a reflection of this strategy 
net realized investment gains increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we engaged new professional investment managers during as part of our overall investment strategy 
while our investment strategy remains focused on high quality  fixed income securities  some changes have been made in our asset allocations among these types of securities to take advantage of changing market conditions 
the increase in net realized investment gains coincides with the liquidation of investments associated with repositioning our investment portfolio 
finance charges and other income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in finance charges and other income is primarily the result of the sale of the renewal rights on interlex s legal professional liability business  whereby we realized income in the amount of million 
finance charges and other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in finance charges and other income is due to our decision to include a provision for finance charges within our florida mpl policy premiums  rather than assessing finance charges separately 
net losses and lae incurred increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net losses and lae incurred in were reduced by an increase in ceded losses and lae incurred under the hannover re reinsurance agreement of million 
the increase in net losses and lae incurred for the year ended december  reflects growth in business  taking into consideration expected loss trends 
our loss ratios for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
a loss ratio is defined as the ratio of loss and lae incurred to net premiums earned 
the decrease in the reported loss ratio for the year ended december  is primarily due to a significant prior year reserve charge taken in  which was not necessary in  loss expense reduction and productivity  our exit from our former group a h business and other  which were partially offset by the effects of the new hannover re agreement 
net losses and lae incurred increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the loss ratios for such periods were and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a decision to adjust reserves upward by million  pre tax 
our decision to increase reserves reflects our policy to maintain our reserves at a conservative level 
excluding the prior year portions of pre tax reserve charges in and of million and million  respectively  net losses and lae incurred increased million  or during the year the increase in losses and lae incurred was partially offset by a decline in our group a h business corresponding with the withdrawal from our group a h programs in the remaining increase is consistent with the growth in business during and continues to reflect our stated objective of maintaining our reserves at conservative levels  taking into consideration expected loss trends and all other pertinent considerations 
the loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate cost of all losses incurred but unpaid and considers prior loss experience  loss trends  our loss retention levels and the expected frequency and severity of claims 
the process of establishing reserves for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
our estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed or as the current legal environment affecting the settlement of our liability claims changes 
any such changes could result in future revisions in the estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverables  and would be reflected in our results of operations for the most recent period being reported coinciding with when the change occurs 
we believe our reserves for losses and lae are adequate  however  given the inherent uncertainty in reserve estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate amount of actual losses will not exceed the related amounts currently estimated 
furthermore  any such difference  either positive or negative  could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
other underwriting expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in other underwriting expenses is attributable to ceding commissions recognized under the terms of the finite quota share reinsurance agreement with hannover re in the amount of million 
in addition  first professionals  our largest insurance subsidiary  performed a study of its expenses incurred in the administration of claims and based on the results of this study  decreased the amount of expenses allocated to lae in other underwriting expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in other underwriting expenses is primarily attributable to additional operating expenses associated with the growth in business and expenses incurred to improve our information systems 
in addition  two of our insurance subsidiaries  first professionals and apac  increased their accruals for guarantee fund assessments by approximately million  combined 
offsetting these increases was a reduction in the allowance for bad debts of million 
other expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in other expenses is due to our adoption of fas in accordance with fas  we ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the first quarter of other expenses declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other expenses for the year included a non recurring pre tax severance charge of million 
income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  income tax expense in increased primarily as a result of an increase in pre tax income when compared with we recognized an income tax benefit in the prior year because our permanent differences  primarily tax exempt interest  were greater than our pre tax income 
the effect of these permanent differences was proportionately less when compared with pre tax income in  resulting in tax expense at an effective rate of 
in  we also engaged outside investment managers and began re positioning investments including the re positioning of investments in tax exempt municipal securities to investments in taxable securities

in accordance with the management agreement between afp and pri  afp receives a management fee equal to of pri s direct premiums written  with an adjustment for expected return premiums 
as such  our revenues and results of operations are financially sensitive to the revenues and financial condition of pri 
pri  as an mpl insurer  is subject to many of the same types of risks as those of our insurance subsidiaries and mpl companies generally 
growth at pri is subject to surplus constraints  however  as a reciprocal  pri is able to operate at higher leverage ratios than non reciprocals such as our insurance subsidiaries 
further  as allowed under new york insurance laws  pri has requested and received permission from the new york state insurance department to follow the permitted practice of discounting its loss and lae reserves 
the new york state insurance department mandates pri s rates  including rates charged for policies in excess of million  which have been reinsured to first professionals 
claims administration and management fees increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in claims administration and management fees is due to an increase in the premiums written by pri 
commission income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in commission income is due to an increase in brokerage commissions earned by intermediaries for the placement of reinsurance  which is the result of an increase in written premiums placed and the rates for reinsurance 
in addition  commission income of approximately million was recognized as a result of a brokerage fee earned from hannover re related to the placement of our finite reinsurance agreement 
commission income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in commission income corresponds with the increase in the amount of reinsurance brokered by intermediaries in other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  effective january   afp and pri amended the management agreement  including the elimination of the sharing by afp of of pri s statutory net income or loss  which accounts for the decline in other income 
the amendment was approved by the new york state insurance department 
other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income is the result of lower statutory net income at pri compared to the year the income received by afp related to pri s statutory net income for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
in accordance with the management agreement between afp and pri  through  afp received or paid an amount equal to of pri s statutory net income or loss 
claims administration and management expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in claims administration and management expenses for the year ended december  is due to an increase in operating expenses incurred to manage the growth in business at pri  offset partially by a decline in risk management department expenses when compared to the year ended december  as noted above  the management agreement between afp and pri was amended in as part of the amended agreement  pri is to reimburse afp for of risk management department expenses as compared with under the former agreement 
claims administration and management expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in claims administration and management expense is primarily attributable to an increase in commission expense incurred as a result of growth in brokerage and administration business at afp and pma 
under terms of the management agreement between afp and pri  afp is responsible for brokerage costs incurred by pri 
in addition  afp incurred additional operating expenses related to the growth in direct business at pri 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is the result of the amendment to the management agreement between afp and pri 
in accordance with the amended agreement  afp has agreed to pay annual interest on the profit share amounts already earned and collected under the original agreement for  and  while those years remain open for possible future re determination and adjustment  if any 
other expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in other expenses is due to the effects of the adoption of fas in accordance with fas  we ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the first quarter of the reciprocal management segment also recorded a transitional impairment charge of million  after tax  which is accounted for as the cumulative effect of accounting change 
the non cash transitional impairment charge primarily reflects certain intangibles and synergies  which  in our opinion  are opportunistic in nature and carry a significant degree of uncertainty  therefore  we treated these intangibles conservatively in the valuation required by fas third party administration our tpa segment is made up of our subsidiary emi

claims administration and management fees declined to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in claims administration and management fees is due to the termination of certain non profitable contracts at our albuquerque division 
excluding the effect of the terminated contracts  claims administration and management fees increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in commission income was million for the year ended december  and relatively flat when compared to commission income for the year ended december  the amount of premium placed by the tpa segment increased during the years and  however  we decreased the commission rates paid by customers during and as a result  commission income was relatively flat when compared with the prior year 
commission income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in commission income corresponds with increases in the underlying rates paid by customers for reinsurance being placed by the tpa segment under alternative market arrangements 
net realized investment losses for the year ended december  were million  largely due to the write down of our investment in a joint venture  bexar credentials  inc bexar in the fourth quarter of our stock in bexar was redeemed for thousand in cash and notes receivable in january all amounts receivable from the sale have been collected

claims administration and management expenses declined  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in claims administration and management expenses is due to the termination of certain non profitable contracts at our albuquerque division 
excluding the effect of the terminated contracts  claims administration and management expenses increased million for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in other expenses decreased for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decline in other expenses is due to the adoption of fas in accordance with fas  we ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the first quarter of in addition  and as noted above  in we recognized a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the disposition of the brokerage services  inc bsi division of emi in albuquerque  new mexico  which did not recur in the tpa segment also recorded a transitional impairment charge of million  after tax in  which is accounted for as the cumulative effect of accounting change 
in our opinion  the non cash transitional impairment charge primarily reflects changes in market conditions and an increase in competition in recent years in the markets served by the tpa segment 
for the year ended december   other expenses decreased  to million from million for the year ended december  excluding the restructuring charges taken during the fourth quarter of and mentioned below  other expenses declined  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in other expenses represents savings from our disposition of non core businesses during during the fourth quarter  we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately million in connection with the disposition of bsi 
under the plan  we sold the division s assets and cancelled its service agreements with self insured customers 
certain other contracts were retained and are serviced by our jacksonville  florida  division 
the restructuring activity was a continuation of our consolidation of the tpa operations and concluded the restructuring activities of the albuquerque division that began during we incurred a pre tax charge of million in related to this now disposed of division 
excluding the effects of the restructuring charges  the tpa segment incurred a net loss of approximately million and million for the years and  respectively 
management s discussion analysis of financial position december  compared to december  cash and invested assets increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in cash and invested assets is due primarily to the growth in premiums and related cash flows from operating activities  which increased the amounts available for investment 
premiums receivable increased to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the increase in premiums receivable is associated with growth in premiums written on our core mpl insurance business 
approximately million of the increase in premiums receivable is associated with growth in premiums written under fronting arrangements for workers compensation business 
due from reinsurers on unpaid losses and advance premiums increased to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the increase is associated with reserves ceded under the finite reinsurance agreement with hannover re 
the remaining increase in due from reinsurers on unpaid losses and advance premiums is primarily the result of the increase in the underlying reserves ceded to other insurance carriers under reinsurance arrangements associated with growth in our core mpl insurance business 
ceded unearned premiums increased to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the increase is associated with the unearned premiums ceded under the finite reinsurance agreement with hannover re 
on august   gerling global reinsurance corporation of america gerling  one of our reinsurers  had its financial strength rating lowered by am best from a excellent to b very good 
on december   gerling s am best rating was further downgraded to b fair 
these rating actions by am best followed an announcement by gerling of its intention to exit the us non life reinsurance market 
since then  gerling has essentially placed itself in voluntary run off with respect to its us non life reinsurance business and am best has withdrawn gerling s financial strength rating and replaced it with the designation nr  which means that am best s rating methodology no longer applies 
gerling has participated in our excess of loss reinsurance programs in at  and in and at 
gerling has also provided facultative reinsurance coverage for non standard risks 
we replaced gerling s participation in our reinsurance programs  effective with our renewal  as of january  as of december   the estimated amount of net reinsurance recoverables from gerling was approximately million  comprised of the gross recoverables from gerling  less reinsurance payables to gerling of approximately million 
gerling is an authorized reinsurer in our markets  therefore  we do not hold collateral for these reinsurance recoverables 
gerling s actions  including placing itself in run off with respect to its us non life reinsurance business  have been voluntary and as recently as march   it has publicly stated that it is paying its outstanding claims 
consequently  we currently expect that gerling will fully meet its obligations to us 
we will continue to monitor developments at gerling and should its financial condition worsen  we could  in turn  recognize a charge for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables 
deferred income taxes increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in deferred income taxes is primarily due to the adoption of fas as a result of the transitional impairment tests required by fas  in we recognized a one time  non cash pre tax charge of million and recorded deferred tax assets for tax deductible goodwill  in the amount of million 
goodwill decreased to million as of december  from million as of december  the decrease in goodwill is due to the adoption of fas as a result of the transitional impairment tests required by fas  we reduced the carrying value of goodwill at our reciprocal management and tpa segments 
the transitional impairment charge at the reciprocal management segment primarily reflects certain intangibles and synergies  which  in our opinion  are opportunistic in nature and carry a relatively higher degree of uncertainty  therefore  we treated these intangibles conservatively in the valuation required by fas the transitional impairment charge at the tpa segment primarily reflects changes in market conditions and an increase in competition in recent years in the markets served by the tpa segment 
other assets increased to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the increase in other assets is due to the sale of investments for which the proceeds from the sale had not been received at december  and a receivable from the broker was recorded 
the increase in other assets is also attributable to receivables for amounts due under our fronting programs and an increase in amounts due from pri related to a change in the management agreement between afp and pri  partially offset by the receipt of a state tax refund due to the overpayment of estimated taxes in the liability for losses and lae increased to million as of december  from million as of december  excluding the effect of the return of loss and lae reserves of approximately million on business previously assumed from pri  which was commuted in the first quarter of  the increase in our liability for loss and lae was approximately million 
the increase in the liability for losses and lae is primarily attributable to the growth in our core mpl book of business  taking into consideration expected loss trends and other pertinent considerations 
the loss and lae reserves represent our best estimate of the ultimate cost of all losses incurred but unpaid and considers prior loss experience  loss trends  our loss retention levels and the expected frequency and severity of claims 
the process of establishing reserves for property and casualty claims is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
our estimates and judgments may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed  as new or improved methodologies are developed or as the current legal environment affecting the settlement of our liability claims changes 
any such changes could result in future revisions in the estimates of losses or reinsurance recoverables  and would be reflected in our results of operations for the most recent period being reported coinciding with when the change occurs 
we believe our liability for losses and lae is adequate  however  given the inherent uncertainty in reserve estimates  there can be no assurance that the ultimate amount of actual losses will not exceed the related amounts currently estimated 
furthermore  any such difference  either positive or negative  could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position 
unearned premiums increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in unearned premiums is the result of the growth in premiums written at our insurance subsidiaries 
reinsurance payable increased to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the increase is the result of funds withheld under the terms of the finite reinsurance agreement with hannover re 
the remaining increase in reinsurance payable is primarily the result of an increase in mpl premiums written 
paid in advance and unprocessed premiums increased to million as of december  from million as of december  the increase in paid in advance and unprocessed premiums is primarily the result of growth in our core mpl book of business 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased to million as of december  from million as of december  approximately million of the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is related to the purchase of investments for which the costs from the purchase had not been paid at december  and a payable to broker was recorded 
approximately million of the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is related to commissions payable associated with an increase in insurance business 
stock repurchase plans under our stock repurchase programs  we may repurchase shares at such times  and in such amounts  as management deems appropriate  subject to the requirement of our credit facility 
in accordance with an amendment to our credit facility dated november   we must obtain the consent of our lenders to repurchase any of our stock 
we did not repurchase any shares during since the commencement of these repurchase programs  we have repurchased  of our shares at a cost of approximately million 
a total of  shares remain available to be repurchased under the programs 
liquidity and capital resources the payment of losses and lae  operating expenses  interest expense and income taxes in the ordinary course of business and the repayment of debt and assignment of collateral are the principal needs for our liquid funds 
cash provided by operating activities has been used to pay these items and was sufficient during to meet these needs 
as reported in the consolidated statement of cash flows  we generated positive net cash from operating activities of million for the year ended december  at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and held fixed maturity debt securities with a fair value of approximately million with scheduled maturities during the next twelve months 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents as of december   combined with cash flows from operating activities and the scheduled maturities of investments in  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for operating purposes for at least the next twelve months 
a number of factors could cause unexpected changes in liquidity and capital resources available  including but not limited to the following i unexpected changes in premium revenue due to higher or lower than expected new business or retention of insurance policies in force  ii unexpected changes in the amounts needed to defend and settle claims  iii unexpected changes in operating costs  including new or increased taxes  iv failure of one or more of our reinsurers leading to uncollectible reinsurance recoverables  v possible impairments of our long term investments  and vi uncertainties surrounding the availability and costs associated with our bank credit financing 
furthermore  liquidity and capital risks can come about as the result of the broader business and financial risks facing us including the uncertainties and factors disclosed in the safe harbor disclosure 
many  if not most of these types of uncertainties  could have a corresponding and materially negative affect on our liquidity and capital resources  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
in order to compensate for such risk  we i maintain what management considers to be adequate reinsurance  ii monitor our reserve positions and regularly perform actuarial reviews of loss and lae reserves  and iii attempt to maintain adequate asset diversification and liquidity by managing our cash flow from operations coupled with the maturities from our fixed income portfolio investments 
as of december   we had an outstanding principal balance of million under a senior credit facility with five banks 
the senior credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility with a million letter of credit sub facility  which matures on august   and ii a million term loan facility  repayable in quarterly installments of approximately million 
we have also deposited million of which  million was deposited in january as collateral under the terms of the credit facility  and are required to either pre pay principal or make additional collateral deposits of million quarterly in the credit facility also requires that we pre pay principal or make additional collateral deposits of approximately million each at march and june  amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate  primarily based upon libor plus a current margin of percentage points  which may be reduced to a minimum of percentage points as we reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
in connection with our credit facility  we also entered into two interest rate swap agreements the swap agreements 
we use the swap agreements to minimize fluctuations in cash flows caused by interest rate volatility and to effectively convert all of our floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
we are not required to maintain compensating balances in connection with our credit facility but we are charged a fee on the unused portion  which ranges from to basis points 
under the terms of the credit facility  we are required to meet certain financial and non financial covenants 
significant covenants are as follows i total debt to cash flow available for debt service may not exceed  ii combined net premiums written to combined statutory capital and surplus may not exceed  iii funded debt to total capital plus funded debt may not exceed  iv the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than at the end of each quarter through december   and thereafter the fixed charge coverage ratio may not be less than  and v combined gross premiums written to combined statutory capital and surplus may not exceed the credit facility also contains minimum equity and risk based capital requirements and requires our insurance subsidiary  first professionals  to maintain at least a b very good group rating from am best 
should we fail to meet one or more of our loan covenants  such occurrence would be considered an event of default 
if we were unable to provide an acceptable resolution for an event of default  our lenders would have the right to demand immediate repayment in full 
although we have consolidated cash and investments on hand and net cash flows from operating activities in excess of our outstanding debt  as explained further below  most of these funds are held and generated by our insurance subsidiaries  which are subject to regulatory requirements to maintain capital and surplus and dividend restrictions 
therefore  the majority of these funds are not available to the holding company 
so  if repayment of our loans were accelerated  fpic may not have sufficient liquidity from immediately available operating funds 
in the case of a significant acceleration or demand for repayment in full  we may be required to secure replacement financing  raise additional capital  restructure our operations or sell assets  or a combination of these  in order to raise the funds necessary to repay our loans 
any such circumstances would likely have a material detrimental impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
on october   am best announced its decision to change our insurance group rating from a excellent with a negative outlook to b very good with a stable outlook 
as a result of the rating change  we were temporarily in non compliance with the credit facility 
as a result of such non compliance  we negotiated an amendment to the credit facility with our lenders 
the terms and conditions of the credit facility described above reflect this amendment 
shareholder dividends available from our insurance subsidiaries are subject to certain limitations imposed by florida and missouri laws 
during  these subsidiaries are permitted  within insurance regulatory guidelines  to pay dividends of approximately million without prior regulatory approval 
the national association of insurance commissioners has developed risk based capital rbc measurements for insurers  which have been adopted by the florida and missouri departments of insurance 
rbc measurements provide state regulators with varying levels of authority based on the adequacy of an insurer s adjusted surplus 
at december   our insurance subsidiaries maintained adjusted surplus in excess of their required rbc thresholds 
our insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by the financial guaranty associations in the states in which they conduct business for the provision of funds necessary for the settlement of covered claims under certain policies of insolvent insurers 
generally  these associations can assess member insurers on the basis of written premiums in their particular states 
in addition to standard assessments  the florida and missouri legislatures may also levy special assessments to settle claims caused by certain catastrophic losses 
we would be assessed on a basis of premiums written 
during  a special assessment was levied on first professionals and apac that totaled million 
no special assessments were made in or in addition  we could be subject to additional assessments in the future as a result of damages caused by catastrophic losses  such as a hurricane 
accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
it requires that the cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  not necessarily at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
as a result  some costs relating to the disposition may be deferred until later periods when they are incurred 
the provisions of fas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  accordingly  we will adopt this statement for applicable transactions occurring on or after january  fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amends fas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide transition guidance for a change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of fas for both annual and interim financial statements 
fas is effective december  the adoption of fas did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements of fas have been incorporated into note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin expands existing accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees and requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of certain types of guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe that the adoption of fin s guidance will have a material effect on our financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses whether certain types of entities  referred to as variable interest entities vies  should be consolidated in a company s financial statements 
a vie is an entity that either has equity investors that lack certain essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest including the ability to control the entity  the obligation to absorb the entity s expected losses and the right to receive the entity s expected residual returns  or lacks sufficient equity to finance its own activities without financial support provided by other entities  which in turn would be expected to absorb at least some of the expected losses of the vie 
an entity should consolidate a vie if it stands to absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses or to receive a majority of the vie s expected residual returns 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for all vies created after january  with respect to vies created before february   fin would become effective for public companies no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  ie  third calendar quarter of 
fin also requires that if it is reasonably possible that an enterprise will consolidate or disclose information about a vie when it does become effective  that the enterprise is required to disclose certain information about it in all financial statements initially issued after january  we have considered the guidance contained in fin and  to date  have not identified any interests or relationships that we believe would be a variable interest in a vie  as defined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market and economic conditions  such as changes in interest rates  spreads among various asset classes  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how we managed those exposures as of december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the fair value of our debt and equity investment portfolio as of december  was approximately million 
our investment portfolio was invested primarily in fixed maturity securities 
the fixed maturity portfolio currently maintains an average moody s credit quality of aa 
we invest in securities with investment grade credit ratings  with the intent to minimize credit risks 
as of december   our investments in below investment grade securities were less than of the fixed income portfolio 
these securities were downgraded subsequent to acquisition by fpic 
approximately of the fixed income portfolio is invested in securities rated aaa or its equivalent by investment rating services  is aa  is a  and is bbb 
we purchased collateral mortgage obligations in the context of our overall investment and asset class allocation strategy and  specifically  to help improve our yields and current income 
approximately of our fixed income portfolio is allocated to the municipal sector 
the balance is diversified through investments in treasury  agency  and corporate and mortgage backed securities 
generally  we do not invest in derivatives and do not currently use hedging strategies in our investment portfolio 
however  we do have investments in two interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate in connection with our revolving credit facility and term loan 
the four market risks that can most directly affect the investment portfolio are changes in us interest rates  credit risks  prepayment risks  and legislative changes  including changes in tax laws that might affect the taxation of our invested securities 
from time to time  discussion arises in the united states congress relative to changing or modifying the tax exempt status of municipal securities 
we stay abreast of possible legislative acts that could adversely affect the tax exempt status of municipal securities 
at present there are no hedging or other strategies being used to minimize this risk 
however  we have also reduced our concentration in tax exempt municipal securities during  as part of our overall investment strategy 
we manage risks associated with the changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the duration of our investments in relation to the duration of our anticipated liabilities principally claim payments and related defense costs 
effective duration is a standard measure of interest rate sensitivity  which takes into account  among other things  the effect that changing interest rates will have on prepayments and the re investment of these funds 
the effective duration of our investment portfolio as of december  was years 
if prevailing market interest rates on investments in debt securities comparable to those we held as of december  were to increase basis points  the fair value of our fixed maturity securities would have decreased approximately million 
the amounts reported as cash flows in the table below for fixed maturities represent par values at maturity date  and exclude investment income and expenses and other cash flows 
the fair values of fixed maturities are based upon quoted market prices or dealer quotes for comparable securities 
the projected cash flows of the credit facility and term loan and operating leases approximate fair value as of december  the fair value of the interest rate swaps is estimated using quotes from brokers and represents the cash requirement if the existing agreement had been settled at year end 
projected cash flows in thousands thereafter total december  fair value assets fixed maturity securities  available for sale      liabilities credit facility   term loan     interest rate swaps  operating leases      weighted average interest rate fixed maturity securities credit facility term loan interest rate swaps in accordance with our amended revolving credit and term loan agreement  we are also required to make mandatory principal prepayments on our term loan or provide liquid collateral acceptable to our lenders  in the amount of million quarterly in and million at march and june
