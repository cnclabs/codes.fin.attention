item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  which reflect our current views about future events and financial results 
we have made these statements in reliance on the safe harbor created by that private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include our views on future financial results  financing sources  product development  capital requirements  market growth and the like  and are generally identified by phrases such as anticipates  believes  estimates  expects  intends  plans and similar words 
forward looking statements are merely predictions and therefore 
table of contents inherently subject to uncertainties and other factors which could cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statement 
these uncertainties and other factors include  among other things  unexpected technical and marketing difficulties inherent in major product development efforts such as the new platform for our urinalysis workstation  the potential need for changes in our long term strategy in response to future developments  future advances in diagnostic testing methods and procedures  as well as potential changes in government regulations and healthcare policies  both of which could adversely affect the economics of the diagnostic testing procedures automated by our products  rapid technological change in the microelectronics and software industries  and increasing competition from imaging and non imaging based in vitro diagnostic products 
we have attempted to identify additional significant uncertainties and other factors affecting forward looking statements in exhibit to this annual report 
stockholders should understand that the uncertainties and other factors identified in this annual report and in exhibit are not a comprehensive list of all the uncertainties and other factors that may affect forward looking statements 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements or the list of uncertainties and other factors that could affect those statements 
overview we generate revenues primarily from sales of our urinalysis workstation  an in vitro diagnostic  or ivd  imaging system based on our patented and proprietary aim technology  and the related supplies and service required to operate this workstation 
we also earn revenues from sales of ancillary lines of small laboratory instruments and supplies 
we make significant investments in research and development for new products and enhancements to existing products 
we fund our research and development programs primarily with internal funds  but we also receive grants from the national institutes of health and to a lesser extent  contracts from third parties 
the following table summarizes total product technology expenditures for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands research and development expense  net capitalized software development costs reimbursed costs for research and development grants and contracts total product technology expenditures critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies upon which our financial position and results of operations depend are those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  and income tax assets and liabilities 
we summarize our most critical accounting policies below 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when goods are shipped and title passes to the customer provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
revenue is recognized net of an allowance for discounts when the sale is recorded 
iris derives revenue from the sale of ivd imaging systems  sales of supplies and services for its ivd imaging systems and sales of small instruments and related supplies 
for sales of supplies and small instruments  iris generally recognizes product revenues once all of the following conditions have been met 
table of contents a an authorized purchase order has been received in writing  b customer credit worthiness has been established  and c delivery of the product based on shipping terms 
certain of iris domestic ivd system sales generally require installation and training to be performed 
management believes that installation and training is not essential to the functionality of the product and accordingly  we recognize revenue on delivery based on shipping terms  provided title has transferred  collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable  we have received an authorized purchase order and the price is fixed and determinable 
the estimated fair value of installation and training is deferred and recognized as these services are performed 
sales of ivd systems internationally are recognized on delivery based on shipping terms  provided collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable  we have received an authorized purchase order and the price is fixed and determinable 
iris recognizes service revenues ratably over the term of the service period  which typically ranges from twelve to sixty months 
payments for service contracts are generally made in advance 
deferred revenue represents the revenues to be recognized over the remaining term of the service contracts 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
inventory costs are based on standard costs  which are updated periodically and supported by actual cost data 
we include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead in the cost of inventories 
in determining inventory market values  we give substantial consideration to the expected product selling price based on historical recovery rates 
in determining our expected selling prices  we consider various factors including estimated quantities of slow moving inventory by reviewing on hand quantities  outstanding purchase obligations and forecasted sales 
we then estimate expected selling prices based on our historical recovery rates for sale of slow moving inventory through various channels and other factors  such as market conditions and current customer preferences 
our estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity and mix of products in inventory  customer preferences and economic conditions 
income tax assets and liabilities 
in establishing our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to our operations 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluate the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income  our ability to use tax credit carryforwards and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions 
we are also subject to examination of our income tax returns for multiple years by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we periodically assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
changes to our income tax provision or in the valuation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities may affect our annual effective income tax rate 
results of operations comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  net revenues for the year ended december  were down  or from the prior year 
sales of ivd imaging systems decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or from the last year 
the decrease is primarily due to decreased sales to international distributors 
ivd imaging system sales consist of sales of our urinalysis workstations 
in november  we introduced a significantly upgraded model based on a new operating platform 
this model  named the iq  received clearance from the food and drug administration on october  we expect to ship this new system towards the end of the second quarter of the failure to make a success and timely transition to the new model would have a material and adverse affect on ivd imaging system sales 
this is an inherent risk in any major upgrade to products in our industry 
sales of ivd imaging system supplies and services increased to million from million  an increase of  or over last year  primarily due to the larger installed base of urinalysis workstations 
royalties and licensing revenues increased to  from  in the prior year 
the increase was 
table of contents primarily due to a new  royalty received by our statspin subsidiary in the current year for which there was no corresponding item in the prior year  and which we do not believe will recur in revenues from the urinalysis segment totaled million in the current period  up slightly from million in the prior year 
revenues from the small lab devices and supplies segment decreased to million from million  a decrease of  or 
the decline is due primarily to the decreased sales to a major oem customer  which more than offset the new  royalty earned by that segment 
cost of goods sold for ivd imaging systems as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging systems totaled in the current period as compared to last year 
the increase is primarily attributable to manufacturing overhead being associated with lower production levels in the current year 
cost of goods sold for ivd imaging system supplies and services as a percentage of sales of such products decreased to for the current period as compared to for the same period last year 
this decrease is due primarily to efficiencies derived from higher volumes and improved manufacturing processes 
cost of goods sold for small instruments and supplies as a percentage of sales of this segment totaled for the current year as compared to in the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to increased costs resulting from smaller production runs in the current period 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenues from the urinalysis segment totaled  down slightly from in the prior year 
the aggregate gross margin totaled for the year ended december   which is comparable with the prior year 
marketing and selling expenses totaled million  compared to million last year  an increase of  or  due primarily to increased marketing efforts in the urinalysis segment  particularly associated with the marketing of the ax marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues were in  up slightly from in general and administrative expenses increased  to million from million in the prior year 
this increase is due primarily to the addition of senior management in general and administrative expenses represented of net revenue  up from in the prior year 
net research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in  an increase of  or 
net research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the prior year 
total product technology expenditures  including capitalized software development costs and reimbursed costs under research and development grants and contracts  was million  down very slightly from the prior year 
the continued high level of total product technology expenditures is due primarily to the iq project begun in to improve our urinalysis workstation product line  and for which we have recently received clearance from the food and drug administration 
we believe that this project is important to maintaining our competitive position in the urinalysis market 
we expect our net research and development expenses to continue at current levels for the first half of  before decreasing slightly in the latter half of the year 
amortization of intangible assets is lower in the current year than in the prior year 
this is due to the fact that the balance in the current year includes only amortization of patents  whereas the year ago amounts also included the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with definite lives 
the company ceased amortization of goodwill in in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
operating income for the year decreased to million as compared to million in  principally due to higher operating expenses in all major categories  as described above  as the company prepares for the launch of its new operating platform 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in the prior year as a result of significantly lower interest rates associated with the revised credit facility from the company s new bankers  along with a continuing reduction in the company s long term indebtedness 
for the year ended december   urinalysis segment profits decreased to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease is attributable to the higher operating expenses described above 
segment profits for the small lab devices segment totaled million  as compared to million in the prior 
table of contents year 
this decrease resulted from lower sales volume in that segment 
unallocated corporate expenses totaled million in as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to reduced charges incurred for legal and audit fees in the current period 
the income tax provision for the year ended december   totaled  as compared to million in the decrease reflects the decreased taxable income experienced by the company in this tax provision is a non cash item  since the company has significant deferred tax assets

revenues from the urinalysis segment totaled million in the current period  down slightly from million in the prior year 
revenues from the small lab devices and supplies segment increased to million from million  an increase of  or 
the increase is due to the launch of new products into the veterinary market and increased sales in the international markets 
cost of goods sold for ivd imaging systems as a percentage of sales of ivd imaging systems totaled in the current period as compared to last year 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased manufacturing overhead associated with improved quality assurance and inventory control processes and the effect of the amortization of certain capitalized software  which began in june cost of goods sold for ivd imaging system supplies and services as a percentage of sales of such products increased to for the current period as compared to for the same period last year 
this increase is due primarily to higher overhead associated with improved quality assurance and inventory control processes 
cost of goods sold for small instruments and supplies as a percentage of sales of this segment totaled for the current year as compared to in the prior year

net research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the prior year 
total product technology expenditures  including capitalized software development costs and reimbursed costs under 
table of contents research and development grants and contracts  increased to million from million  an increase of million or as compared to the prior year 
the increase in total product technology expenditures was due primarily to increased spending under a major project begun in to improve our urinalysis workstation product line 
amortization of intangible assets reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets and patents and is essentially unchanged in from the prior year 
interest expenses decreased to  in from  in the prior year due to reduced indebtedness and lower interest rates corresponding to a drop in our lender s prime rate 
for the year ended december   urinalysis segment profits decreased to million from million in the prior year

contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following table aggregates the company s expected contractual obligations and commitments subsequent to december  totals payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations long term debt capital lease commitments operating lease commitments total contractual cash commitments liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents remained at roughly million at december   unchanged from the balance at december  cash provided by operations for the year ended december  increased to million from million in the prior year  primarily due to lower receivable and inventory levels and higher levels of accounts payables and accrued expenses  which more than offset the drop in net income described above 
our primary source of liquidity is cash from operations  which depends heavily on sales of our urinalysis workstations 
we introduced the iq system  built on a new operating platform  in late november we received clearance from the food and drug administration on october  however  revenues from the sale of this product are not anticipated until sometime in the second quarter of the failure to make a successful and timely transition to the new model would have a material and adverse affect on workstation sales and  consequently  our liquidity 
this is an inherent risk in any major upgrade to products in our industry 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in  as compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is primarily due to the increase in expenditures for property and equipment as part of our efforts to upgrade the facilities 

table of contents net cash used by financing activities totaled  and consisted primarily of net principal payments under the credit facility and principal payments of our subordinated note payable  partially offset by funds received from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in february  we refinanced our existing credit facility and replaced it with a new million credit facility with california bank and trust 
the new facility consists of a  term loan  a million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the  term loan is payable in equal monthly installments 
the million term loan carries interest only for the first months  followed by months of equal principal payments plus interest 
the million credit line matures in june borrowings under the line of credit are limited to a percentage of eligible receivables and inventory 
the entire credit facility bears interest at the lender s prime rate  or libor rate plus 
at december   the company was in compliance with all of its covenants under the bank agreement 
we expect to continue to incur high levels of research and development expenditures in we plan to continue to fund this project with cash generated from operations 
we reduced our outstanding debt by million in and  after considering the effect of the refinancing discussed above  we have scheduled principal payments totaling million during the next twelve months 
we believe that our current cash on hand  together with cash generated from operations and cash available under the credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal operations and pay principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations for at least a year 
discontinued business operations we sold perceptive scientific instruments  our genetic analysis business  in july its principal product was the powergene family of genetic analyzers ivd imaging systems for karyotyping  dna probe analysis and comparative genomic hybridization 
we sold the assets of the us operations to applied imaging corporation nasdaq aicx for  shares of applied imaging common stock  the assumption of certain liabilities and contingent cash payments tied to the future performance of applied imaging s business 
we retained the houston based research group  including its federally funded research grants  and changed the name of the group to advanced digital imaging research  llc 
we were unable to sell the international operations and placed perceptive scientific international limited a wholly owned subsidiary of perceptive scientific instruments into a voluntary liquidation under united kingdom law 
we have classified perceptive scientific instruments as a discontinued operation for accounting purposes and have removed it from most of the discussion and financial information in this annual report and our other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission after july new accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfasb requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
therefore  discontinued operations will no longer be measured at net realizable value or include amounts for operating losses that have not yet occurred the company adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on its financial statements

this statement also rescinds sfas no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed market conditions 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

fin is applicable to financial statements to be issued by the company after  however  disclosures are required currently if the company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
the company does not currently believe that any material entities will be consolidated with international remote imaging systems  inc 
as a result of fin shareholder rights plan we have a shareholders rights plan 
the rights are not presently exercisable 
they become exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock  or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock  without board approval 
if the rights are triggered  all common stockholders except the hostile party will be entitled to purchase shares of common stock or the economic equivalent in preferred stock at a price based on a substantial discount from the market price of the common stock 
the board of directors may terminate the plan at any time or redeem the rights prior to their becoming exercisable 
the rights expire on december  market risk our business is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not invest in derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rates we rely significantly on long and short term fixed and variable rate debt in our capital structure 
we do not use interest rate swaps to manage any of our floating rate debt obligations 
as of december   our debt obligations consisted of million subordinated loan outstanding at a variable rate of prime plus 
table of contents  million term loan outstanding at a variable rate and million under a revolving line of credit at a variable rate 
the variable rate obligation is based upon the lender s prime rate 
see liquidity and capital resources 
assuming an increase of one half of a percentage point in the lender s prime rate on january  and no principal payments for the remainder of the year  our total interest expense would increase by less than  for as compared to foreign currencies we are subject to some currency risk on a portion of our licensing revenues  as well as from purchases of product from our japanese manufacturer of the ax the licensing portion is calculated quarterly based on sales results in japanese yen and subsequently converted into united states dollars at the then current exchange rate 
our purchases of product are negotiated annually and may be affected by changing foreign currency rates 
investment available for sale we are subject to market risk relating to the investment in equity investments that are held and carried as available for sale 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market conditions that may be deemed as other than temporary declines in the fair value of the investment 
inflation we do not foresee any material impact on our operations from inflation 
healthcare reform policies in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the healthcare system  nationally  at the state level or both 
future legislation  regulation or payment policies of medicare  medicaid  private health insurance plans  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors could adversely affect the demand for our current or future products and our ability to sell our products on a profitable basis 
moreover  healthcare legislation is an area of extensive and dynamic change  and we cannot predict future legislative changes in the healthcare field or their impact on our business
