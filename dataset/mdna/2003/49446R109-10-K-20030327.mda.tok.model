in addition  leases typically provide for reimbursement to the company of common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other operating expenses 
operating expense reimbursements are recognized as earned 
rental income may also include payments received in connection with lease termination agreements

if in management s opinion  the estimated net sales price of these assets is less than the net carrying value  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

 accounting for real estate sales 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the property over its remaining useful life is less than the net carrying value of the property 
such cash flow projections consider factors such as expected future operating income  trend and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the property would be adjusted to an amount to reflect the estimated fair value of the property 
when a real estate asset is identified by management as held for sale the company ceases depreciation of the asset and estimates the sales price of such asset net of selling costs 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the asset is less than the net book value of such asset  an adjustment to the carrying value would be recorded to reflect the estimated fair value of the property

other real estate investments during november  the company  through its taxable reit subsidiary  together with prometheus southeast retail trust  completed the merger and privatization of konover property trust  which has been renamed kimsouth realty  inc  kimsouth 
the company acquired of the common stock of kimsouth  which consisted primarily of retail shopping center properties comprising approximately million square feet of gla 
total acquisition value was approximately million including approximately million in mortgage debt 
on december   kimsouth obtained a cross collateralized three year mortgage  aggregating million at a variable rate of libor plus which replaced i a secured line of credit for million and ii a construction loan for million 
all mortgages  which are collateralized by the individual shopping center properties  are due in monthly installments 
the scheduled maturities of all mortgages payable as of december   are approximately as follows in millions     and thereafter  at december   the weighted average interest rate for all mortgage debt outstanding was per annum 
during june  the company acquired a equity participation interest in an existing leveraged lease of properties 
the properties are leased under a long term bond type net lease whose primary term expires in  with the lessee having certain renewal option rights 
the company s cash equity investment was approximately million 
this equity investment is reported as a net investment in leveraged lease in accordance with sfas no 
as amended 
the net investment in leveraged lease reflects the original cash investment adjusted by remaining net rentals  estimated unguaranteed residual value  unearned and deferred income  and deferred taxes relating to the investment 
as of december   four of these properties were sold whereby the proceeds from the sales were used to paydown the mortgage debt by approximately million 
as of december   the remaining properties were encumbered by third party non recourse debt of approximately million that is scheduled to fully amortize during the primary term of the lease from a portion of the periodic net rents receivable under the net lease 
as an equity participant in the leveraged lease  the company has no general obligation for principal or interest payments on the debt  which is collateralized by a first mortgage lien on the properties and collateral assignment of the lease 
accordingly  this debt has been offset against the related net rental receivable under the lease 
effects of inflation many of the company s leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling the company to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of tenants gross sales above pre determined thresholds  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses often include increases based upon changes in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of the company s leases are for terms of less than years  which permits the company to seek to increase rents to market rates upon renewal 
most of the company s leases require the tenant to pay an allocable share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance costs  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to short term interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and will  from time to time  enter into interest rate protection agreements and or foreign currency hedge agreements which mitigate  but do not eliminate  the effect of changes in interest rates on its floating rate debt and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
