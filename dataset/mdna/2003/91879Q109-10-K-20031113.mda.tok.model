item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is an analysis of the company s results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
to the extent that the following management s discussion and analysis contains statements which are not of a historical nature  such statements are forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
these risks include  but are not limited to  changes in the competitive environment of the mountain and lodging industries  general business and economic conditions and the weather and other factors discussed elsewhere herein and in the company s other filings with the sec 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement included at the end of this section 
explanatory note the company has restated its consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended july  and for the adjustments discussed below 
the total of these adjustments  net of income taxes  is million  resulting in reductions to net income of  in fiscal  million in fiscal and  related to the three fiscal years prior to fiscal employee housing joint venture accounting the company has ownership interests in four entities which own and operate seasonal employee housing facilities see note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  for more detailed information regarding these entities 
the company has historically accounted for these entities under the equity method of accounting  recording its pro rata share of their profits or losses based on the company s ownership percentage  which ranges from to 
three of the entities have accumulated deficits in excess of the respective partners investments in and advances to the entities that arose primarily from depreciation expense recorded  as the entities are generally designed to operate on a cash flow neutral basis 
the company had historically recorded its proportionate equity ownership share of the entities losses  reducing the carrying amount of its investments in the entities below zero 
this had been done due to the letters of credit issued against the company s credit facility that support a portion of the entities debt 
after further review this fiscal year of the structure of the entities and each of the partners obligations  the company determined that it should have recorded of the losses in excess of the other shareholders investments in and advances to the entities  as those other shareholders have no legal obligation to absorb or fund the losses and it is unlikely that the other shareholders would fund their share of such losses 
in addition  the company also determined that the financial statements prepared by the entities which it had historically used to record its equity method profit or loss were prepared on a tax basis  therefore  the restatement includes the adjustments necessary to convert the entities financial statements from a tax basis to generally accepted accounting principles 
the adjustments related to employee housing joint venture accounting decrease net income by  in fiscal and by  in fiscal  and decrease beginning retained earnings by  in fiscal for adjustments related to prior periods 
executive deferred compensation the company compensates its chief executive officer ceo with a package that included cash  restricted stock and stock options  membership interests in several of the company s lunch and golf clubs  and awards of property see note  non cash deferred compensation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
with respect to one of the property awards  at the time of grant  the company estimated the fair value for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation cost to be recognized 
in  a transaction entered into by the ceo caused the company to reconsider whether its estimates made at the date of grant were proper 
the company determined that its estimate was incorrect and required retroactive adjustment 
the compensation expense recorded in and has been adjusted primarily to reflect the appropriate estimate of fair market value of the homesite itself 
the deferred compensation adjustments include a  increase to fiscal net income and a million decrease to fiscal net income 
interest income from bachelor gulch resort  llc bg resort the company received interest payments from bg resort a owned joint venture accounted for under the equity method in fiscal and on loans and advances made by the company to bg resort  which the company recorded as interest income at the time 
in fiscal  the company became aware that bg resort had capitalized these interest payments as a component of the costs of the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch construction  which would have required an elimination entry associated with vail s ownership share of the entity to be recorded by the company 
as such  the company is deferring the recognition of interest income related to its ownership interest in bg resort and is recognizing the effects of this deferral as a basis difference as bg resort records the related cost of sales and depreciation expense 
this adjustment decreases fiscal net income  and fiscal net income  capitalized interest on investment in bg resort the company is required to capitalize the interest incurred with respect to its investments in and loans and advances to bg resort during the pre opening construction period from july through november of the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch 
the company had expensed these interest costs as incurred  and is therefore restating the prior periods to reduce the interest expense recorded and increase the investment in bg resort 
this adjustment increases fiscal net income  and fiscal net income  and includes a  increase to fiscal beginning retained earnings for interest incurred in fiscal depreciation expense and other related items during the fiscal year end review process  the company discovered that certain constructed fixed assets were not transferred from construction in process upon completion in a timely manner  resulting in an understatement of depreciation for the related periods 
in addition  in relation to this adjustment  the company also determined that it had eligible qualifying expenditures pursuant to fas  capitalization of interest  but did not record the associated capitalization of interest 
the adjustments include corrections to the historical accounting for each of these items  and decrease fiscal net income by  and fiscal net income by  results of operations fiscal was particularly challenging for the company  as it experienced an overall net loss for the year  the first in the company s history since becoming a public company in in october  the company proactively implemented a million year over year cost reduction plan to counteract the expected softness in the nationwide leisure travel and lodging market 
the plan included the elimination of approximately positions see note  workforce reduction  of the notes to consolidated financial statements and other changes to improve operational efficiency 
the company began its fiscal year with a promising early ski season  with good snowfall  strong skier numbers  the successful opening of the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch and better than expected performance from heavenly 
however  despite the strong start  world events took a toll on the financial performance of the company during fiscal the economy has not completely recovered since the september  terrorist attacks and travel patterns  including group and corporate travel  have not returned to normal 
the uncertainty over war and the ultimate start of war with iraq just prior to the company s peak opera ting season had an even more dramatic impact on visitation at the company s properties  which was then exacerbated by the outbreak of a previously unheard of and deadly virus throughout the world called sars 
these factors and certain other non cash charges resulted in year over year declines in profitability for the company s mountain and lodging segments see note  segment information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  as well as an overall net loss of million for the year 
the company s financial statements for fiscal reflect certain non cash charges that significantly impact the company s net loss position for the year 
these charges include non cash compensation expense see note  non cash deferred compensation  of the notes to consolidated financial statements of million related to the issuance of restricted stock and real property transferred to the company s ceo and vrdc s president pursuant to their employment agreements the company also reflected million and million of related non cash compensation expense in fiscal and  respectively  a non cash charge of million related to the impairment of an option to acquire certain development land near vail mountain see note  impairment charge  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company s proportionate equity share of losses from bg resort related to start up costs and initial operating losses incurred from the company s interest in the ritz carlton  bachelor gulch  which opened in november million  increases in actuarial reserves related to workers compensation and medical benefits million  and incremental depreciation expense associated with the major acquisitions the company made in fiscal million 
the company expects earnings to improve in fiscal  given a normal snow year and barring any unforeseen events 
the company does not expect that the non cash charges noted above will have as significant an impact in fiscal the company plans to cut costs further in fiscal through the implementation of a previously announced million year over year cost savings improved profits plan 
key components of this plan include implementing a mandatory time off policy for all full time year round employees  restructuring of the company s health plan and other employee benefits plans  implementing process improvements in the company s operations to achieve operational efficiencies and obtain cost savings  and decentralizing the marketing and sales organization to allow each of the company s properties to provide more focused and targeted messages to guests 
as a result of the marketing and sales decentralization  the company terminated the employment of three employees and  consequently  accrued approximately  of severance expense as of july  see note  workforce reduction  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
presented below is more detailed comparative data regarding the company s results of operations for the following periods fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july   and fiscal year ended july  versus fiscal year ended july  the following analysis includes discussion of financial performance within each of the company s segments 
the company has chosen not to specifically address reported ebitda defined as segment net revenues less segment specific operating expenses plus segment equity income in the following discussion  although management considers this measurement to be a significant indication of the company s financial performance 
instead  the company has discussed each of the significant components of reported ebitda

the letters of credit were issued by the company to facilitate the housing entities ability to obtain external financing 
those letters of credit expire october  the company anticipates these debt service agreements will be renewed 
the tranche b housing bonds range in principal amount from million to million million in aggregate and are collateralized by the assets of the entities 
the company also guarantees debt service of million on the tranche b housing bonds  million of these guarantees expire may  and million expire june  the proceeds of the housing bonds were used to construct the housing facilities 
the letters of credit or guarantees would be triggered in the event that one of the entities defaults on required tranche a payments 
the guarantees would be triggered in the event that one of the entities defaults on required tranche b debt service payments 
neither the letters of credit or guarantees h ave default provisions 
the housing facilities except breckenridge terrace  llc are located on land owned by the company which is leased to each respective entity 
in the event of a default under the land leases  the company is able to terminate the land lease and effectively take ownership of the housing facilities 
the company has the right to rent a certain percentage of the units in the housing facilities to provide seasonal housing for its employees 
had the company not entered into the leasing arrangements with these four entities  it is reasonably possible that the company would have had to construct facilities  which would have required additional financing  in order to provide affordable housing for its employees 
while the company does not believe it reasonably likely that the letters of credit and guarantees in support of the employee housing entities debt will be called upon  and historically have not been drawn upon  the company is absorbing the equity method losses of the employee housing en tities in excess of its ownership interests in these entities primarily because of these guarantees 
the company has also issued letters of credit in support of the debt of the metropolitan districts as more fully discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these entities constructed  own and operate municipal facilities supporting real estate developments created by the company 
the initial construction of the facilities was financed by the issuance of tax exempt variable rate revenue bonds 
the company issued the letters of credit in support of these bonds as credit enhancement 
had the metropolitan districts not been formed  it is reasonable possible that the company would have been required to construct these facilities itself 
the company does not believe that it is reasonably likely that the letters of credit backing the metropolitan districts debt will be called upon  and they historically have not been drawn upon  and therefore are not expected to have an effect on the company s financial condition  revenues  expenses  results of opera tions  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to select appropriate accounting policies and to make judgments and estimates affecting the application of those accounting policies 
in applying the company s accounting policies  different business conditions or the use of different assumptions may result in materially different amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which the company s financial status depends 
the critical principles were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
the most critical accounting policies identified relate to i revenue recognition  ii deferred revenue  iii reserve estimates  iv intangible assets  v related party transactions  vi income taxes and vii real estate held for sale 
revenue recognition 
mountain and lodging revenues are derived from a wide variety of sources  including sales of lift tickets  ski snowboard school tuition  dining  retail stores  equipment rental  hotel operations  property management services  travel reservation services  private club dues and fees  real estate brokerage  conventions  golf course greens fees  licensing and sponsoring activities and other recreational activities  and are recognized as products are delivered or services are performed 
revenues from real estate sales other than retail land sales are recognized when collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured and the earnings process is virtually complete  generally upon transfer of title to the buyer 
contingent future profits are recognized only when realized 
the company applies the full accrual method of revenue recognition for retail land sales  and thereby recognizes revenue on retail land sales upon transfer of title to the buyer 
if the company has an obligation to complete improvements of lots sold or to construct amenities or other facilities applicable to lots sold after transfer of title with respect to retail land sales  then the company utilizes the percentage of completion method of revenue recognition 
deferred revenue 
in addition to deferring certain revenues related to the real estate segment  the company records deferred revenue related to the sale of season ski passes  certain daily lift ticket products and private club initiation fees 
season pass revenue is recognized each time a season pass is used to access a ski resort based on a rate established using the total estimated visits of a season pass holder for the ski season 
during the ski season the estimated visits are compared to the actual visits and adjustments are made if necessary 
season pass revenue is ultimately fully recognized within the course of the ski season in which it is collected 
revenues from club initiation fees are initially deferred and recognized over the expected life of the club facilities 
reserve estimates 
the company uses estimates to record reserves for certain liabilities  including medical claims and workers compensation for which the company is self insured in colorado  legal liabilities and liabilities for the completion of real estate sold by the company  allowance for accounts receivable and metropolitan district interest subsidies  among other items 
the company estimates the total potential costs related to these liabilities that will be incurred  and records that amount as a liability in its financial statements 
these estimates are reviewed and appropriately adjusted as the facts and circumstances related to the liabilities change 
intangible assets 
the company frequently obtains intangible assets  primarily through business combinations 
the assignment of value to individual intangible assets generally requires the use of a specialist  such as an appraiser 
the assumptions used in the appraisal process are forward looking  and thus are subject to significant interpretation 
because individual intangible assets i may be expensed immediately upon acquisition  ii amortized over their estimated useful life  or iii not amortized  the assigned values could have a material effect on current and future period results of operations 
further  intangibles are subject to certain judgments when evaluating impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  discussed further in note  supplementary balance sheet information  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions 
the company from time to time enters into related party transactions see note  related party transactions  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process requires the company to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
as of july   the company had a net current deferred tax asset of million  which represented approximately of total assets 
the net deferred tax asset contains a valuation allowance representing the portion that management does not believe will be recovered from future taxable income 
management believes that sufficient taxable income will be gene rated in the future to realize the benefit of the company s remaining net deferred tax assets 
the company s assumptions of future profitable operations are supported by the company s strong operating performance over the last several years except in fiscal and the absence of factors that would indicate this trend would be unlikely to continue 
real estate held for sale 
the company capitalizes as land held for sale the original acquisition cost  direct construction and development costs  property taxes  interest incurred on costs related to land under development  and other related costs engineering  surveying  landscaping  etc 
until the property reaches its intended use 
the cost of sales for individual parcels of real estate or condominium units within a project is determined using the relative sales value method 
selling expenses are charged against income in the period incurred 
estimates of the remaining costs to be incurred for units that have been sold are accrued at the date of sale  based on management s best estimate 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others

it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company adopted the provisions of fin no 
as of january   which did not have a significant impa ct on its financial position or results of operations see note  commitments and contingencies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  by providing alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this statement amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  for transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions  interim disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december  
initial adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities vies 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the interpretation applies immediately to vies created after february   and to vies in which the company obtains an interest after that date 
the interpretation applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  in october  the fasb decided to defer the implementation date for fin no 
 to financial statements issued for the first period ending after december  this deferral only applies to vies that existed prior to fe bruary  the company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of this interpretation will have on its financial statements see note  variable interest entities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  and requires that financial instruments within its scope  many of which currently are classified as equity  be classified as liabilities or  in some circumstances  assets 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the first interim period beginning after june  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp on november  to defer the effective date for applying the provisions of sfas no 
for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests 
the company does not expect the implementation of sfas no 
will have a significant impact on its financial position or results of operations 
inflation although the company cannot accurately determine the precise effect of inflation on its operations  management does not believe inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations in the last three fiscal years 
when the costs of operating resorts increases  the company generally has been able to pass the increase on to its customers 
however  there can be no assurance that increases in labor and other operating costs due to inflation will not have an impact on the company s future profitability 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s mountain and lodging operations are seasonal in nature 
in particular  revenues and profits for the company s mountain and most of its lodging operations are substantially lower and historically result in losses in the summer months 
conversely  gtlc s and certain managed properties peak operating seasons occur during the summer months while the winter season generally results in operating losses due to closure of all revenue generating operations 
however  revenues and profits generated by gtlc s summer operations and management fees from those managed properties are not sufficient to fully offset the company s off season losses from its mountain and lodging operations 
during the fiscal year  of total combined mountain and lodging revenues were earned during the second and third fiscal quarters 
quarterly results may be materially affected by the timing of snowfall and the integration of acquisitions 
therefore  the operating results for any three month period are not necessari ly indicative of the results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 
the company is taking steps to smooth its earnings cycle by investing in additional summer activities  such as golf course development  and also through lodging acquisitions 
see note  selected quarterly financial data  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
economic downturn skiing and tourism are discretionary recreational activities that can be impacted by a significant economic slowdown  which  in turn  could impact the company s operating results 
while the recent extended economic downturn has negatively impacted the company s operating results  the company had not historically been adversely impacted by economic downturns 
there can be no assurance that a continued or future decrease in the amount of discretionary spending by the public would not have an adverse effect on the company 
unfavorable weather conditions the ski industry s ability to attract visitors to its resorts is influenced by weather conditions and the amount and timing of snowfall during the ski season 
unfavorable weather conditions can adversely affect skier visits 
in the past years the company s colorado ski resorts have averaged between and feet of annual snowfall and the company s california ski resort receives average yearly snowfall of between and feet  significantly in excess of the average for us ski resorts 
however  there is no assurance that the company s resorts will receive seasonal snowfalls near the historical average in the future 
also  the early season snow conditions and skier perceptions of early season snow conditions influence the momentum and success of the overall season 
the company believes that poor snow conditions early in the ski season during the and ski seasons had an adverse effect on operating results for those periods 
a severe and prolonged drought could affect the company s otherwise adequate snowmaking water supplies 
there is no way for the company to predict future weather patterns or the impact that weather patterns may have on results of operations or visitation 
labor market the company s resort and lodging operations are largely dependent on a seasonal workforce 
the company recruits worldwide to fill staffing needs each season  and utilizes hb visas to enable the use of foreign workers 
in addition  the company manages seasonal wages and timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place 
while the company does not currently foresee the need to increase seasonal wages to attract employees  it cannot guarantee that such an increase would not be necessary in the future 
in addition  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain the visas necessary to hire foreign workers  who are an important source for the seasonal workforce 
increased seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  however  the company is unable to predict with any certainty whether such situations will arise or the potential impact to results of operations 
terrorist acts upon the united states and acts of war the terrorist acts carried out against the united states on september  have had an adverse effect on the global travel and leisure industry 
the war with iraq and its aftermath also had an adverse effect on the company 
the company cannot guarantee if or when normal travel and vacation patterns will resume 
additional terrorist acts against the united states and the declaration of war by the united states could result in further degradation of discretionary travel upon which the company s operations are highly dependent 
such degradation could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s exposure to market risk is limited primarily to the fluctuating interest rates associated with variable rate indebtedness 
at july   the company had million of variable rate indebtedness  representing of the company s total debt outstanding  at an average interest rate during fiscal of 
the company s average interest rate is based on its various credit facilities and any associated letter of credit fees  unused fees and deferred financing charges see note  long term debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
based on average floating rate borrowings outstanding during the years ended july   and  a basis point change in libor would have caused the company s annual interest expense to change by million   and  respectively 
the company s market risk exposure fluctuates based on changes in underlying interest rates
