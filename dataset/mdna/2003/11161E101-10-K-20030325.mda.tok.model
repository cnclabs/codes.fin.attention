item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis along with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks discussed in factors that may affect out future results below and elsewhere in this report 
overview corvis corporation designs  manufactures and sells high performance all optical and electrical optical communications systems that we believe accelerate carrier revenue opportunities and lower the overall cost of network ownership for carriers 
we also provide installation and professional services that support our product offerings 
we believe our optical products enable a fundamental shift in network design and efficiency by allowing for the transmission  switching and management of communications traffic entirely in the optical domain 
these products include terrestrial and undersea ultra long distance optical signal transmission  reception and amplification equipment  all optical and electrical optical switching equipment and software that enable the creation of high performance optical backbone networks 
by deploying our products  carriers eliminate the need for expensive and bandwidth limiting electrical regeneration and switching equipment  significantly reducing costs  increasing network capacity and allowing them to more quickly and efficiently provide new services 
our products also open new market opportunities for carriers by enabling a flexible  in service migration path from existing point to point and ring electrical optical networks to all optical mesh networks 
our point to point regional and repeaterless products no in line amplifiers allow carriers to use their existing networks more efficiently  enabling the transmission of optical signals in greater capacity over longer distances than existing technology 
starting in and continuing in and  conditions within the general economy and telecommunications sector have resulted in reduced capital expenditures by carriers and a reduced demand for telecommunications networking systems 
these declines have had an adverse impact on our revenue and results of operation 
we cannot predict when market conditions will improve 
in response to these conditions  we have implemented a series of restructuring initiatives designed to decrease our business expenses and to align resources for long term growth opportunity 
the actions included staff reductions  facility consolidations and the curtailment of certain discretionary spending 
in addition  we announced a multi year manufacturing outsourcing agreement with celestica  a world leader in electronics manufacturing services 
under the agreement  we will transition all of our manufacturing capabilities to celestica with the exception of final assembly  system integration and testing capabilities 
the transition is expected to be complete in the second quarter of in may  we completed our acquisition of dors l networks  inc  a privately held provider of next generation transoceanic and regional undersea optical network solutions  for million shares of common stock valued at approximately million 
we believe dors l s next generation transoceanic and regional undersea solutions complement our leading edge terrestrial transmission and switching equipment and our repeaterless festoon systems  allowing us to better address carriers global needs 
subsequent event we have agreed to invest approximately million in cash in c iii communications  llc  a delaware limited liability company  which on february   agreed to acquire most of the assets and certain liabilities of broadwing communications services inc for a purchase price of million 
c iii communications will also assume million in long term operating commitments upon closing of the transaction 
we have also agreed to contribute an additional million to c iii communications by december  to fund ongoing 
table of contents operating expenses 
broadwing is a current customer of corvis  accounting for in revenue in c iii communications was formed for the purpose of making this investment together with cequel iii  llc  an investment and management company based in st 
louis  missouri and headed by jerald l 
kent  the founder of charter communications 
corvis will initially retain a ownership interest in c iii communications and will appoint of the board members 
cequel iii will initially retain a ownership interest in c iii communications and will appoint of the board members 
broadwing inc  the parent company of broadwing communications services  will initially retain a equity interest in c iii communications 
in connection with this transaction  we are evaluating the possibility of raising a portion of these funds from other investors which could reduce our committed investment amount and percentage of ownership 
c iii communications will be overseen by a board of directors  with day to day operations being run by an executive committee consisting of members  of whom will be appointed by corvis and of whom will be appointed by cequel iii  with the final member being subject to the approval of both parties 
cequel iii will also provide certain other management services to c iii communications  including appointing personnel and advising with respect to finance  human resources and sales and marketing management matters 
the assets acquired by c iii communications include  recently completed route miles of fiber optic cables  an all optical backbone network comprised primarily of corvis equipment  network operations center  and all of the other network elements necessary to provide broadband telecommunications services 
through these assets  c iii communications will provide managed network solutions and broadband telecommunications services to more than  corporate customers in of the top markets in the united states  broadband transportation services to major telecommunications carriers  and long distance telecommunications services to more than  customers 
the primary business lines for c iii communications are broadband transport  switched voice services  data and internet services 
broadband transport services consist of long haul transmission of data  voice and internet traffic over dedicated circuits 
switched voice services consist of billed minutes of use  primarily for the transmission of voice long distance services on behalf of both wholesale and retail customers 
data and internet services consist of the sale of high speed data transport services utilizing technology based on internet protocol ip  atm frame relay  data collection and web hosting 
under the terms of the agreement  c iii communications will assume certain long term operating commitments of broadwing communications services inc and its subsidiaries  will continue providing services to customers under the broadwing tradename  and will retain current employees 
no outstanding debt obligations will be assumed in the transaction 
broadwing inc s local communications subsidiary  cincinnati bell  will remain a customer of broadwing communications services inc the asset purchase agreement was approved by our board of directors and is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval by the federal communications commission and relevant state public utility commissions 
the closing of the transaction is also contingent upon the receipt of various other third party consents 
customers in  we continued to focus on further developing our customer relationships 
we currently have six customers  including broadwing communications services  inc  wiltel communications group  inc 
formally williams communications  llc  qwest communications corporation  telefonica de espana sau  france telecom and the sau federal government 
broadwing has agreed to purchase at least million of our products and services as part of a multi year purchase agreement 
since successfully completing field trials in july  broadwing has deployed a wide range of our optically optimized networking products  including the all optical switch  to create a national all optical network that has been in service for over a year 
sales to broadwing continue as part of network expansions and maintenance 
cumulative sales to broadwing through december  totaled million 
c iii communications  an entity in which corvis will initially retain a ownership interest  has agreed to acquire broadwing communications services  inc see subsequent event 

table of contents in  wiltel accepted a field trial system and agreed to purchase up to million of our products and services as part of a multi year purchase agreement 
firm commitments under the contract are limited to approximately million which must be purchased prior to december  wiltel has deployed our switching and transport equipment in their national network  which is currently in service carrying commercial traffic 
cumulative sales to wiltel through december  totaled million 
on april   we reached an agreement with qwest communications corporation modifying the terms of our previous purchase agreement 
under the terms of the new agreement  qwest agreed to purchase up to million of our products and services over a multi year period 
firm commitments totaling million were required to have been purchased in and million must be purchased in subject to certain acceptance criteria 
in addition  we agreed with qwest to enter into two field trials of corvis on transport and switching equipment as well as our corvis ocs 
corvis recognized million in revenue in after receiving lab certification from qwest 
during the first quarter of  we completed the first sales of our xf repeaterless link product to telefonica de espana  which was deployed between the island of mallorca and telefonica s backbone network in spain 
in april  we sold a xf repeaterless link to france telecom to upgrade its link between the european mainland and the island of corsica 
the relationships with telefonica and france telecom are in early stages and the agreements do not include additional purchase commitment levels 
however  we hope to develop these arrangements into long term business relationships 
in the third quarter of  we created a wholly owned subsidiary  corvis government solutions  inc cgsi  to provide optical networking solutions and services to the us federal marketplace 
during the third quarter  cgsi secured its first contract and purchase order from the us federal government for a limited field trial totalling approximately million 
shipments under this contract began in the fourth quarter of we expect to recognize the associated revenue in we have also entered into lab trials and discussions regarding laboratory and field trials with other carriers for our corvis on  corvis ocs and transoceanic subsea products 
upon successful completion of these field trials  we hope to enter into agreements for commercial deployment with new customers 
critical accounting policies we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory obsolescence asset impairment  revenue recognition  product warranty liabilities  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions and the variances could be material 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon execution of a contract and the completion of all delivery obligations provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance and collectibility is deemed probable 
if uncertainties exist  revenue is recognized when such uncertainties are resolved 
customer contracts generally include extensive lab and field trial testing and some include other acceptance criteria 

table of contents our products can be installed by our customers  third party service providers or by us 
revenue from installation services is recognized as the services are performed unless the terms of the supply contract combine product acceptance with installation  in which case revenues for installation services are recognized when the terms of acceptance are satisfied and installation is completed 
to the extent customer contracts include both product sales and installation services  revenues are recognized based on their respective fair values 
revenues from installation service fixed price contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to estimated total costs for each installation contract 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognized are included as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet 
revenue from annual maintenance agreements is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
costs of revenue 
costs of revenue include the costs of manufacturing our products  delivering services and other costs associated with warranty  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to our manufacturing  engineering  finishing and installation operations 
warranty reserves are determined based upon actual warranty cost experience  estimates of component failure rates and management s industry experience 
inventory obsolescence costs are estimated using certain assumptions  including projected sales and sales mix 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
we continually monitor component failures  technical changes  and levels of on hand inventory and adjust our estimates accordingly 
if  however  actual results vary significantly from our estimates  we will adjust the assumptions utilized in our methodologies and reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
allowance for bad debt 
we relied on six customers for all of our revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be generated by a limited number of customers 
one of these customers  broadwing communications services  inc  has agreed to sell substantially all of its assets to c iii communications  llc  an entity in which corvis will initially retain a ownership interest 
we monitor the financial conditions of our remaining customers closely and have concluded that no allowance for bad debt was appropriate as of december  restructuring and other charges 
reflecting continued unfavorable economic conditions and continued lack of expected customer wins and product sales  our board of directors approved plans for the reduction of operations including the consolidation of facilities  reduction of employees  the outsourcing of a majority of our manufacturing capabilities and the discontinuation of certain product lines 
facility consolidation costs are based on assumed exit costs and timetables 
asset impairment charges are based on estimated salvage values  recoverability estimates and estimated fair values 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated recoverability of these assets  additional restructuring and impairment charges may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions 
through december   goodwill and intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over their respective lives of between and years 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on december   we ceased amortizing goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment initially within one year of adoption transitional test and at least annually thereafter 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process that requires goodwill to be allocated to reporting units 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit  a goodwill impairment may exist  and the second step of the test is performed 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the carrying value of the goodwill  and an impairment loss will be recognized to the extent that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
if an impairment loss exists as a result of the transitional goodwill impairment test  the implementation of sfas could result in a one time charge to earnings as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
the company performed the transitional test and determined that no adjustment to carrying value was required 

table of contents in performing the annual test  the company determined the estimated fair value of its reporting units and compared it to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as a result of the comparison  there was an indication that a certain reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the second step of the impairment test was performed 
in the second step  the company compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
the residual fair value after this allocation was the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
as a result of the second step of the impairment test  the company recognized approximately million excluding approximately million of impairment related to patents as impairment of goodwill and recorded the impairment loss as a component of restructuring  impairment and other charges 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management or if events occur or circumstances change that would reduce the estimated recoverability of these assets  additional impairment charges may be required 
litigation 
in july  ciena corporation ciena informed us of its belief that there is significant correspondence between products that we offer and several us patents held by ciena relating to optical networking systems and related dense wavelength division multiplexing communications systems technologies 
on july   ciena filed a lawsuit alleging that we are willfully infringing three of ciena s patents relating to optical networking systems and related dense wavelength division multiplexing communications systems technologies 
a fourth patent was subsequently added to the lawsuit 
in february  jury trials were held on the issues of infringement and invalidity of the four patents 
corvis all optical networking products were found not to infringe two of ciena s wdm system patents 
the jury did not reach a verdict on a third ciena wdm system patent  which is related to the two non infringed wdm system patents 
a new trial date for the patent upon which the jury did not reach a verdict is scheduled tentatively for late april corvis inverse multiplexing transceiver product  which can be used along with our all optical networking products  was found to infringe a ciena patent on bit rate transparent devices 
while we believe that the interim jury verdicts in the ciena litigation are favorable and would not materially affect our business  financial condition or results of operations  we cannot be certain that the interim jury verdicts will be upheld  or that infringement of other patents in the suit will not be found in later legal proceedings 
to the extent it is necessary  a trial to determine damages will be held following any appeals 
such appeals can take up to a year or more before final determination 
based on the current status of the litigation  we cannot reasonably predict the likelihood of any final outcome 
between may  and june   nine class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york relating to our initial public offering on behalf of all persons who purchased our stock between july  and the filing of the complaints 
each of the complaints names as defendants corvis  our directors and officers who signed the registration statement in connection with our initial public offering  and certain of the underwriters that participated in our initial public offering 
our directors and officers have since been dismissed from the case  without prejudice 
the complaints allege that the registration statement and prospectus relating to our initial public offering contained material misrepresentations and or omissions in that those documents did not disclose that certain of the underwriters had solicited and received undisclosed fees and commissions and other economic benefits from some investors in connection with the distribution of our common stock in the initial public offering and that certain of the underwriters had entered into arrangements with some investors that were designed to distort and or inflate the market price for our common stock in the aftermarket following the initial public offering 
the complaints ask the court to award to members of the class the right to rescind their purchases of corvis common stock or to be awarded rescissory damages if the class member has sold its corvis stock and prejudgment and post judgment interest  reasonable attorneys and experts witness fees and other costs 
by order dated october   the court appointed an executive committee of six plaintiffs law firms to coordinate their claims and function as lead counsel 
lead plaintiffs have been appointed in almost all of the ipo allocation actions  including the corvis action 
on october   a group of underwriter defendants moved 
table of contents for judge scheindlin s recusal 
the judge denied that application 
on december   the moving underwriter defendants filed a petition for writ of mandamus seeking the disqualification of the judge in the united states court of appeals for the second circuit 
on april   the second circuit denied the moving underwriter defendants application for a writ of mandamus seeking the judge s recusal from this action 
on april   plaintiffs filed amended complaints in each of the ipo allocation actions  including the corvis action 
on may   a conference was held at which the court set a briefing schedule for the filing of motions to dismiss the amended complaints 
on july   the underwriter defendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaints 
on july   the issuer defendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaints 
the briefing on the motions to dismiss has been completed  and the judge heard oral arguments on the motions on november  on february   the issuer defendants motion to dismiss was granted with regard to certain claims and denied with regard to certain other claims 
as to corvis  the section b and rule b claims  alleging that corvis participated in a scheme to defraud investors by artificially driving up the price of the securities  were dismissed with prejudice  but the section claims  alleging that the registration statement contained a material misstatement of  or omitted  a material fact at the time it became effective  survived the motion to dismiss 
settlement discussions among all interested parties are ongoing 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
based on the status of the litigation  we cannot reasonably predict the likelihood of any potential outcome 
we continue to monitor the status of the litigation  however we can give no assurances that an unfavorable outcome will not result in future charges 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in revenue was attributable to a decrease in demand for optical communications systems 
revenue for the years ended and is attributable to five customers and two customers  respectively 
services  including customer support  installation and training  represented in and in most of our customers have met or are approaching contractual minimum purchase commitments and have reached the end of long term service contracts 
the amount of product and service revenues in and beyond will depend on the amount and timing of future firm order commitments from existing customers  as well as new contract wins 
gross profit loss 
costs of revenue consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering  finishing and installation operations 
as a result of discontinued product lines under our restructuring plans and excessive inventories due to reduced capital expenditures by telecommunications carriers  we recorded cost of revenue charges totaling million in and million in gross profit loss increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the fiscal year ended december  from for the fiscal year ended december  due to current competitive and economic pressures on our prices  we expect that gross margin  excluding inventory write downs and other charges  may further decrease in the coming quarters 
excluding inventory write downs and other charges of million in and million in  gross margin would have been in compared to in the decrease in adjusted gross profit reflects decreases in pricing as well as decreased volume efficiencies in our manufacturing operation 
research and development  excluding equity based expense 
research and development  excluding equity based expense  consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  test and prototype expenses related to the design of our hardware and software products  laboratory costs and facilities costs 
all costs related to product development  both hardware and software  are recorded as expenses in the period in which they are incurred 
due to the timing and nature of the expenses associated with research and development  significant quarterly fluctuations may result 
we believe that research and development is critical in achieving current and future strategic product objectives 

table of contents research and development expenses  excluding equity based expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction in prototype material usage 
in light of recent restructuring plans that have been implemented to date  investments in research and development will continue though at lower than historical levels 
sales and marketing  excluding equity based expense 
sales and marketing  excluding equity based expense  consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory trial systems provided to customers  trade shows  other marketing programs and travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses  excluding equity based expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to a reduction in headcount and marketing and tradeshow programs offset  in part  by an increase in lab trial expenses 
general and administrative  excluding equity based expense 
general and administrative  excluding equity based expense  consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  information systems support  recruitment expenses and facility demands associated with maintaining the proper infrastructure to support our organization 
this infrastructure consists of executive  financial  legal  information systems and other administrative responsibilities 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses was primarily attributable to reductions in employee headcount offset in part by increases in professional services 
equity based expense 
equity based expenses consists primarily of charges associated with amortization of employee options granted at below fair market value prior to our initial public offering 
equity based expense related to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative functions for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease in equity based compensation resulted from decreases in employee headcount 
amortization of intangible assets 
historically  amortization of intangible assets primarily related to the amortization of goodwill associated with the acquisition of algety telecom sa as a result of the issuance of sfas no 
 we no longer record amortization of goodwill 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets that are separate and have finite useful lives  such as acquired patent rights and intellectual property licenses  continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
amortization of intangible assets expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill under sfas no 
purchased research development 
on may   we completed our acquisition of dors l networks  inc  a privately held provider of next generation transoceanic and regional undersea optical network solutions  for million shares of common stock valued at approximately million 
the purchase price of dors l was allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and included approximately million of purchased in process research and development that was expensed on the acquisition date 
restructuring  impairment and other charges 
during and continuing in  we developed and implemented restructuring plans designed to decrease our operating expenses and to align our resources for long term growth opportunities 
in addition  we evaluated the recoverability of our inventory and long lived assets in 
table of contents light of these plans and the current and projected economic environment 
as a result  we recorded the following charges in thousands cost of sales inventory write down and other restructuring and other workforce and facility reductions valuation and impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill total restructuring and other charges other charges impairment of strategic equity investments total restructuring and impairment charges cost of sales inventory write downs and other 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete  excess and overvalued inventory based on estimated sales projections and market values 
as a result of the decline in spending by telecommunications carriers and the discontinuation of certain products  we recorded million in and million in in inventory write downs and other related charges 
workforce reductions and facility consolidation 
during  we initiated companywide workforce reduction programs that resulted in the elimination of approximately positions and associated charges of approximately million 
in addition  we recorded approximately million in charges associated with the cost of exiting certain facilities taken out of service 
during  workforce reduction programs continued including substantial reductions in our french operations and resulted in the elimination of positions and million in related charges offset in part by approximately million associated with adjustments to reduce facility consolidation reserves recorded in prior periods 
during the first quarter of  we announced further work force reduction programs resulting in the further elimination of positions and that we are in the process of developing further consolidation plans 
as a result  we expect to incur further restructuring charges during valuation and impairment of long lived assets 
in  in light of current and projected market conditions within the telecommunications industry  we performed an analysis as to the recoverability of our long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded a write down of goodwill totaling million associated with our july acquisition of algety sa  a french company that develops and markets high capacity  high speed optical networking equipment 
in  we adopted sfas no 
and ceased amortizing goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  under the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we completed an impairment review of our goodwill with assistance from independent appraisers 
based on the assessment  we recorded a write down of goodwill and intangible assets totaling million associated with our may acquisition of dors l networks 
also in  in light of the outsourcing of our manufacturing operations and the reduction of research and development initiatives  we decommissioned certain fixed assets and reviewed the recoverability of the long lived assets still in use 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded impairment charges totaling million 
other charges impairment of strategic equity investment 
we have made strategic equity investments in certain startup companies totaling these investments are carried at cost as we own less than of the 
table of contents voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies 
we recorded charges within other income  net totaling million in and million in  associated with the permanent impairment of these investments resulting from the impact of economic conditions on certain of these investees 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million of net interest income for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average invested cash balances from the proceeds of the initial public offering and other private placements and lower average returns on investments and charges associated with the write down of certain strategic equity investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue increased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in revenue was attributable to the increased sales of our products for commercial use 
revenue for the year ended and was attributable to two customers and one customer  respectively 
gross profit loss 
costs of revenue consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  inventory obsolescence costs and overhead related to our manufacturing and engineering  finishing and installation operations 
in association with certain discontinued products under our restructuring plans and excessive inventories due to reduced capital expenditures by telecommunications carriers  during we recorded cost of revenue charges totaling million comprised of inventory write downs of approximately million and losses from open purchase commitments and loss contracts of approximately million 
gross profit loss decreased to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the fiscal year ended december  from for the fiscal year ended december  excluding inventory write downs and other charges of million for the fiscal year ended december   gross profit was million and gross margin was 
research and development  excluding equity based expense 
research and development expenses  excluding equity based expense  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was primarily attributable to increases in headcount and increased expenses associated with prototype development and laboratory materials 
sales and marketing  excluding equity based expense

table of contents equity based expense related to research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative functions for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in equity based compensation resulted from options granted with exercise prices below fair value at the date of grant related primarily to grants prior to our initial public offering 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the amortization of intangibles resulting from the acquisition of algety telecom sa  which resulted in approximately million in goodwill  excluding the impacts of the impairment charges described above  that was being amortized over five years 
interest income expense  net 
interest income  net of interest expense  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million of net interest income for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average invested cash balances from the proceeds of the initial public offering and other private placements and lower average returns on investments  offset in part by interest incurred under various credit facilities 
liquidity and capital resources since inception through december   we have financed our operations  capital expenditures and working capital primarily through public and private sales of our capital stock  borrowings under credit and lease facilities and cash generated from operations 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents and investments totaled million 
we have agreed to invest approximately million in cash in c iii communications  llc  a delaware limited liability company  which on february   agreed to acquire most of the assets and certain liabilities of broadwing communications services inc for a purchase price of million 
see subsequent event 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a net loss of million  offset in part by non cash charges including depreciation and amortization of million  equity based expense of million and purchased research and development expense of million associated with our acquisition of dors l networks in may and certain non cash restructuring charges of million 
cash flows from operating activities were further offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   december  and december  was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to significant reductions in capital expenditures 
net cash provided by used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to the repayment of principal on notes and capital leases as well as the purchase of treasury stock 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to the sale of investments associated with restricted cash and proceeds from stock options and warrants exercised offset in part by the repayment of principal on notes and capital leases 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  million  primarily attributable to proceeds from our initial public offering and other private placements  and the issuance of notes payable  offset in part by the payment of debt and an increase in restricted cash 
as of december   long term restricted cash totaled million associated with outstanding irrevocable letters of credit relating to lease obligations for various manufacturing and office facilities and other 
table of contents business arrangements 
these letters of credit are collateralized by funds in our operating account 
various portions of the letters of credit expire at the end of each respective lease term or agreement term 
on october   we announced that our board of directors had authorized a share repurchase program under which we can acquire up to million of our common stock in the open market 
at december    shares had been purchased under the plan for a total of million 
the purchases will be executed at times and prices considered appropriate by us during the next two years 
the share repurchase program may be implemented at such future date as we may determine and may be suspended at any time and from time to time without prior notice 
the repurchase program will be funded using our existing cash balances and the repurchased shares may be used for corporate purposes in compliance with applicable law 
due to current economic conditions  we have and may be required to sell our products to future customers at lower margins or be required to provide customers with financing which could result in reduced gross margins  extended payment terms or delayed revenue recognition  all of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
if we or our outsourcing partner experience delays or disruptions in manufacturing output or we are unable to successfully manufacture our products and to develop alternative manufacturing sources in a timely manner  our sales  financial position and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working capital  capital expenditure and investment requirements beyond the next twelve months 
if cash on hand and cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing shareholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results

factors that may affect our future results risks related to the industry our business has been adversely affected by recent developments in the communications industry and the economy in general 
for much of the last five years the market for our equipment has been influenced by the entry into the communications services business of a substantial number of new companies 
in the united states that was due largely to changes in the regulatory environment  in particular those brought about by the telecommunications act of these new companies raised billions of dollars in capital  much of which they invested in new equipment  causing an acceleration in the growth of the market for telecommunications equipment 
recently  we have seen a significant reversal of this trend  including the failure of a large number of the new entrants and a sharp contraction of the availability of capital to the industry 
bankruptcies in the industry have slowed expenditures and investments 
this  in turn  has caused a substantial reduction in demand for telecommunications equipment  including our products 
this industry trend has been compounded by the slowing not only of the united states economy but the economies in virtually all of the countries in which we are marketing our products 
the combination of these factors has caused customers to become more conservative in their capital investment plans and more uncertain about their future purchases 
as a consequence  we are facing a market that is both reduced in absolute size and more difficult to predict and plan for 
we expect the factors described above to affect our business  for at least several more quarters  if not longer  in several significant ways compared to the recent past it is likely that our markets will be characterized by reduced capital expenditures by our customers  our ability to forecast the volume and product mix of our sales will be substantially reduced  and we will continue to experience price pressures 
we are exposed to the credit risk of our customers 
industry and economic conditions have weakened the financial position of some of our customers and potential customers 
to sell to some of these customers  we may be required to extend favorable payment terms 
while we monitor these situations carefully and attempt to take appropriate measures to protect ourselves  it is possible that we may have to write down or write off doubtful accounts 
such write downs or write offs  if large  
table of contents could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we have provided extended credit terms to some of our customers 
while we have done only a limited amount of this type of financing in the past  the increasingly competitive environment in which we operate may require us to engage in more competitive financing arrangements 
our ability to recognize revenue from financed sales will depend on the relative financial condition of the specific customer  among other factors 
any change in the financial condition of our customers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
the markets for optical networking products are evolving and uncertain and our business will suffer if they do not develop as we expect 
most carriers have made substantial investments in their current network infrastructure  and many have announced significant reductions in their capital expenditures 
it is uncertain when these reductions in capital expenditures will be reversed 
in addition  carriers may elect to remain with current network architectures or to adopt new architectures in limited stages or over extended periods of time 
a decision by a customer to purchase our optical networking solutions will involve a significant capital investment 
we will need to convince these carriers of the benefits of our solutions for future network deployment 
we cannot be certain that a viable market for our products will further develop or be sustainable 
if this market does not develop further  or develops more slowly than we expect  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability 
competition in optical networking markets is intense 
these markets have historically been dominated by large companies  such as alcatel  cisco  lucent  ciena and nortel 
we may face competition from other large communications equipment companies that are currently in or that may enter our market 
in addition  a number of private companies have announced plans for new all optical products to address the same network needs that our products address 
due to several factors  including the lengthy sales cycle  testing and deployment process and manufacturing constraints associated with large scale deployments of our products  we may lose any advantage that we might have by being an early provider of all optical network products prior to achieving market penetration 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources than we do and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing efforts  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and provide more vendor financing than we can 
moreover  our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately than we do and could develop new technologies that compete with our products or render our products obsolete 
due to the rapidly evolving markets in which we compete  additional competitors with significant market presence and financial resources may enter our markets  further intensifying competition 
in order to compete effectively  we must  among other things  deliver products that provide high reliability  provide an overall cost effective solution for carriers  reduce operating costs  increase network capability easily and efficiently with minimal disruption  operate with existing equipment and network designs  reduce the complexity of the network in which they are installed by decreasing the amount of equipment required  and provide effective network management 
in addition  we believe that a knowledge of the infrastructure requirements applicable to carriers  experience in working with carriers to develop new services for their customers  and an ability to provide vendor financing 
table of contents are important competitive factors in our market 
we have limited knowledge of carriers infrastructure requirements and limited experience in working with carriers to develop new services 
in addition  we currently provide only a limited vendor sponsored financing program 
many of our competitors  however  are able to offer more complete financing programs  which may influence prospective customers to purchase from our competitors rather than from us 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our current and future competitors  we may have difficulty obtaining customers  and could experience price reductions  order cancellations  increased expenses and reduced gross margins  any one of which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the communications industry is subject to government regulations that could harm our business 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  has jurisdiction over the entire communications industry and  as a result  our products and our customers products are subject to fcc rules and regulations 
current and future fcc rules and regulations affecting communications services  our products or our customers businesses or products could negatively affect our business 
in addition  international regulatory standards could impair our ability to develop products for international carriers in the future 
delays caused by our compliance with regulatory requirements could result in postponements or cancellations of product orders  which would harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
further  we cannot be sure that we will be successful in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory approvals that may  in the future  be required to operate our business 
risks related to our financial results we have incurred significant losses since inception  and we expect losses to continue in the future 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion 
we expect to incur significant losses in the near term 
we cannot be certain that we will ever achieve profitability 
we will need to generate significant revenue and control costs to achieve profitability 
our limited operating history makes financial forecasting and evaluation of our business difficult 
our limited operating history makes it difficult to forecast our future operating results 
we have only a limited history selling our optical network products 
although we began operations in  we began generating revenue in the second half of because we have a limited history upon which to base forecasts of future operating results  you should not rely on our past financial performance to evaluate our future financial performance and any predictions about our future revenues and expenses may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer  more stable business history 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our revenue and operating results will vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate 
the primary factors  among other things  that may affect our quarterly results include the following loss of customers or the ability to attract new customers  satisfaction of contractual customer acceptance criteria  cancellation of or delays in customer orders  demand for optical networking products and services  the length and variability of the sales cycle for our products and services  
table of contents the timing and size of sales of our products and services  our ability to maintain production volumes and quality levels for our products and services  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  new product introductions and enhancements by our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and ship new products and product enhancements that meet customer requirements in a timely manner  the timing and magnitude of product development expenses  our ability to attract and retain key personnel  issuances or sales by us of common stock or other securities in the future  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and general economic conditions as well as those specific to the communications and related industries 
a delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
it is possible that in some future quarters our results may be below the expectations of analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our common stock will likely decrease 
the long and variable sales cycles for our products may cause our revenue and operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  which may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our products are designed to enable all optical transmission and switching of data traffic over long distances 
we expect that customers who purchase these products will do so as part of a large scale deployment of these products across their networks 
we also offer point to point solutions which we expect to be purchased by customers to cover high traffic routes 
in each case  a customer s decision to purchase our all optical network products will involve a significant commitment of its resources 
a lengthy testing and product qualification process  a portion  or all  of which is funded by us  will precede any final decision to purchase our products 
throughout this sales and qualification cycle  we will spend considerable time and expense educating and providing information to prospective customers about the uses and features of our products 
the timing of deployment of our products may vary widely and will depend on the specific network deployment plan of the customer  the installation skills of the customer  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the degree of hardware and software configuration necessary 
customers with substantial or complex networks have traditionally expanded their networks or upgraded their systems in large increments on a periodic basis 
accordingly  we may receive purchase orders for significant dollar amounts on an irregular and unpredictable basis 
in addition  customers may request the cancellation of purchase orders 
because of our limited operating history and the nature of our business  we cannot predict the timing or size of these sales and deployment cycles 
long sales cycles  as well as our expectation that customers will tend to place large orders sporadically with short lead times  may cause our revenue and results of operations to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
we currently have six customers and we expect that substantially all of our revenue will be generated from a limited number of customers 
the target customers for our products are carriers that operate communications networks 
there are only a limited number of potential customers in our target markets 
we currently have six customers who have signed 
table of contents agreements to purchase our products broadwing communications services  inc  wiltel communications group  inc 
formally williams communications  llc  qwest communications corporation  telefonica de espana sau  france telecom and the us federal government 
each of these agreements contains significant obligations  the breach of which could result in termination of the agreement 
c iii communications  an entity in which corvis will initially retain a ownership interest  has agreed to acquire broadwing communications services  inc see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent event 
we expect that for the forseeable future substantially all of our revenue will depend on sales of our optical network products to a limited number of potential customers 
the rate at which customers purchase products from us will depend  in part  on the increasing demand for bandwidth by carriers customers 
any failure of carriers to purchase products from us for any reason  including any downturn in their business  may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on our key personnel to manage our business effectively 
if we are unable to retain our key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
our future success depends upon the continued services of our executive officers and other key engineering  manufacturing  operations  sales  marketing and support personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships that we rely on to implement our business plan 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees  including dr 
david huber  our founder  chairman and chief executive officer  could delay the development and production of our products and negatively impact our ability to maintain customer relationships  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have significant experience in international markets and may have unexpected costs and difficulties in developing international revenue 
we have developed a sales and marketing staff outside of the united states 
international operations may be subject to certain risks and challenges that could harm our results of operations  including  among other things difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations  longer sales cycles for our products  reduced protection for intellectual property rights  difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  longer sales cycles for our products  compliance with international standards that differ from domestic standards  political and economic instability  fluctuations in exchange rates  changes in regulatory requirements in the communications industry  expenses associated with developing and customizing our products for foreign countries  tariffs  quotas and other import restrictions on communications products  and potentially adverse tax consequences 

table of contents risks related to product manufacturing we are currently transitioning a substantial portion of our manufacturing capability to an outside party as part of a sole source manufacturing outsource agreement 
if we are unable to transition our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or if we do not accurately project demand  our financial condition and results of operation could be harmed 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to develop and manufacture our products cost effectively 
to do so  we will have to develop  with our outsource partner  manufacturing processes that will allow us to produce sufficient quantities of products at competitive prices 
if we are unable to transition our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner or if we do not accurately project demand  we will have insufficient capacity or excess capacity  either of which will seriously harm our business 
there are numerous risks associated with outsourcing manufacturing capabilities  including  among other things  the following difficulties in achieving adequate yields from new manufacturing lines  the inability to meet customer delivery requirements during the transition period  and increased warranty costs due to reductions in quality control 
after the transition to celestica is complete  we will have limited internal production capacity and we will rely on celestica to meet our production specifications to fill orders on a timely basis 
under the terms of the contract  we will provide celestica with demand forecasts up to six months prior to scheduled delivery to our customers 
if we overestimate our requirements  we may be subject to certain cancellation penalties or be required to purchase quantities in excess of our needs 
if we underestimate our requirements  celestica may not have adequate inventory to meet our production need which could result in shipment delays to our customers or we could be subject to additional charges 
we depend on sole source and limited source suppliers for several key components 
if we are unable to obtain these components on a timely basis  we will be unable to meet our customers product delivery requirements  which would harm our business 
our products include several key components from single or limited sources 
from time to time  there have been industry wide shortages of some optical components 
furthermore  given current economic conditions  several suppliers have made the decision to no longer support certain component manufacturing or have ceased operations entirely 
if any of our sole or limited source suppliers experiences capacity constraints  work stoppages or any other reduction or disruption in output  including ceasing operations entirely  they may be unable to meet our delivery schedule 
our suppliers may enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors  be acquired by our competitors  go out of business  stop selling their products or components to us at commercially reasonable prices  refuse to sell their products or components to us at any price or be unable to obtain or have difficulty obtaining components for their products from their suppliers  and we may be unable to develop alternative sources for the components 
even if alternate suppliers are available  identifying them is often difficult and time consuming 
we have key components that are available from only one qualified supplier 
the process of qualifying vendors can take a significant amount of time and is not always successful 
if we do not qualify multiple vendors or receive critical components in a timely manner  we will be unable to manufacture our products in a timely manner and would  therefore  be unable to meet customers product delivery requirements 
any failure to meet a customer s delivery requirements could harm our reputation and decrease our sales  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents some of our competitors are also our suppliers and if our supply relationship with them deteriorates  it could harm our business 
some of our component suppliers are both our primary source for those components and major competitors in the market for communications equipment 
for example  we buy some of our key components from lucent and alcatel  each of which offers communications systems and equipment that compete with our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed if these supply relationships were to change in any manner adverse to us 
risks related to our products because optical networking products are complex and are deployed in complex environments  our products may have defects that we discover only after full deployment  which could seriously harm our business 
optical products are complex and are designed to be deployed in large quantities across complex networks 
because of the nature of the products  they can only be fully tested when completely deployed in large networks with high amounts of traffic 
our customers may discover errors or defects in the hardware or the software  or our products may not operate as expected  after they have been fully deployed 
if we are unable to fix defects or other problems that may be identified in full deployment  we would experience  among other things loss of  or delay in  revenue and loss of market share  loss of existing customers  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  and increased insurance costs 
the occurrence of any of these problems would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
defects  integration issues or other performance problems in our products could result in financial or other damages to our customers or could negatively affect market acceptance for our products 
our customers could also seek damages for losses from us  which  if the customers were successful  would seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a product liability claim brought against us  even if unsuccessful  would likely be time consuming and costly and would put a strain on our management and resources 
our business will suffer if we do not respond rapidly to technological changes 
the market for network communications equipment is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and changes in customer requirements 
we may not be able to respond quickly or effectively to these developments 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements 
the constant introduction of new products by competitors  market acceptance of products based on new or alternative technologies or the emergence of new industry standards has led to significant inventory write downs and could render our existing or future products obsolete  which may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in developing our products  we have made  and will continue to make  assumptions about the industry standards that may be adopted by our competitors and potential customers 
if the standards adopted are different from those that we have chosen to support  market acceptance of our products may be significantly reduced or 
table of contents delayed and our business will be seriously harmed 
in addition  the introduction of products incorporating new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete 
in order to introduce products incorporating new technologies and new industry standards  we must be able to gain access to the latest technologies of our suppliers  other network vendors and our potential customers 
any failure to gain access to the latest technologies may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will suffer if our current and future products do not meet specific customer requirements 
customers may require product features and capabilities that our products do not have 
to achieve market acceptance for our products  we must anticipate and adapt to customer requirements and offer products and services that meet customer demands 
our failure to develop products or offer services that satisfy customer requirements may seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we intend to continue to invest in product and technology development 
the development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process that requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent the development  introduction or marketing of new products and enhancements 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage the transition from older to newer products in order to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand 
our inability to effectively manage this transition may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from third party challenges 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our technology is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we are involved in an intellectual property dispute and in the future we may become involved in similar disputes  which could subject us to significant liability  divert the time and attention of our management and prevent us from selling our products 
on july   ciena filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of delaware alleging that we are willfully infringing three of ciena s patents 
a fourth patent was subsequently added to the lawsuit 
ciena sought injunctive relief  monetary damages including treble damages  as well as costs of the lawsuit  including attorneys fees 
on september   we filed an answer to the complaint  as well as counter claims alleging  among other things  invalidity and or unenforceability of the patents in question 
on march   a motion was granted  allowing ciena to amend its complaint to include allegations that we are willfully infringing two additional patents 
one patent was dropped from the litigation by agreement of the parties prior to trial 
in february  jury trials were held on the issues of infringement and invalidity of the remaining four patents 
corvis all optical networking products were found not to infringe two of ciena s wdm system patents 
the jury did not reach a verdict on a third ciena wdm system patent  which is related to the two non infringed wdm system patents 
a new trial date for the patent upon which the jury did not reach a verdict is scheduled tentatively for late april corvis inverse multiplexing transceiver product  which can be used along with our all optical networking products  was found to infringe a ciena patent on bit rate transparent devices 

table of contents we intend to defend ourselves vigorously against any subsequent appeals and we believe that we will ultimately prevail in this litigation 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the defense of the appeals  and an adverse determination could result from a finding of infringement of only one claim of a single patent 
while the interim jury verdicts in the ciena litigation are favorable and would not materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  we cannot be certain that the interim jury verdicts will be upheld  or that infringement of other patents in the suit will not be found in later legal proceedings 
to the extent it is necessary  a trial to determine damages will be held following any appeals 
such appeals can take up to a year or more before final determination 
we may consider settlement due to the costs and uncertainties associated with the appellate process  litigation in general  and patent infringement litigation in particular  and due to the fact that an ultimate adverse determination in the litigation could preclude us from producing some of our products until we were able to implement a non infringing alternative design to any portion of our products to which such a determination applied 
even if we consider settlement  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach a settlement with ciena 
a final adverse determination in  or settlement of  the ciena litigation could involve the payment of significant amounts by us  or could include terms in addition to payments  such as a redesign of some of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on the court s current decisions  we believe that our business  financial condition and results of operations will not be materially affected  however  on appeal  we cannot be certain that the current decisions will be upheld  or that infringement will not be found on any of the other patents in question 
we or our customers may be a party to additional litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or to respond to allegations that we infringe others intellectual property 
any parties asserting that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights would force us to defend ourselves and possibly our customers against the alleged infringement 
if we are unsuccessful in any intellectual property litigation  we could be subject to significant liability for damages and loss of our proprietary rights 
intellectual property litigation  regardless of its success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
in addition  we could be forced to do one or more of the following stop selling  incorporating or using products that include the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or redesign those products that use the technology  which may be time consuming or impossible 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
if necessary licenses of third party technology are not available to us or are very expensive  our business would be seriously harmed 
we currently license technology  and from time to time we may be required to license additional technology  from third parties to sell or develop our products and product enhancements 
our existing and future third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
our inability to maintain or obtain any third party license required to sell or develop our products and product enhancements could require us to obtain substitute technology of lower quality or performance standards or at greater cost  any of which could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to the development of our business our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at a limited number of key individuals within our prospective customers organizations 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to develop and manage these relationships 
this effort requires specialized sales personnel as well as experienced sales engineers 
competition for these individuals is intense because there are a limited number of people available with the necessary business background and 
table of contents understanding of our market 
when we hire them or contract for these personnel  they may require extensive training in our network products 
we might not be able to hire the kind and number of sales personnel and sales engineers required for us to be successful 
if we are unable to adjust our sales  customer service and support operations  we may not be able to effectively market our products  which may prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability 
we have previously offered warrants to purchase our common stock to three of our customers 
we may be unable to attract new customers unless we continue to offer similar equity arrangements 
two of our customers purchased an equity interest in us  and a third customer holds a warrant to purchase our common stock 
although these customers purchased the equity interests at fair value and the warrant has an exercise price equal to the fair value on the date of grant  the opportunity to invest in us provided these customers with an additional incentive to purchase our products 
in order to attract new customers  we may need to offer equity to them 
our business will suffer if we fail to properly manage our size and continually improve our internal controls and systems 
we continue to adjust the scope of our operations  as well as our manufacturing and customer support capabilities  develop new distribution channels and fund research and development 
adjustments have included significant staff reductions in both and  continuing in our ability to successfully offer our products and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
in order to manage our size properly  we must train  manage and retain qualified personnel  including engineers and research and development personnel  effectively plan and implement product portfolio improvements and innovations  manage our manufacturing operations  controls and reporting systems  effectively manage multiple relationships with our customers  suppliers and other third parties  and implement additional operational controls  reporting and financial systems and procedures 
failure to do any of the above in an efficient and timely manner could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we become subject to unfair hiring claims we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or management s attention could be diverted away from our operations 
companies in our industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that their competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have received claims of this kind in the past  and we may receive claims of this kind in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves or our employees against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in addition  defending ourselves from such claims could divert the attention of management away from our operations 
we may need additional capital to fund our existing and future operations 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing and sales efforts  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the development  marketing and sales of new products is expected to require a significant commitment of resources 
we may incur significant operating losses or expend significant amounts of capital if  among other things the market for our products develops more slowly than anticipated  
table of contents we fail to establish market share or generate revenue  our capital expenditure forecasts change or prove inaccurate  and we need to respond to unforeseen challenges or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
as a result  we may need to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  the terms of such debt could impose additional restrictions on our operations 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing and sales efforts  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to our investment in c iii communications by investing in c iii communications  we will be the majority owner of an entity that owns and operates a national telecommunications network  which will be in direct competition with our current and potential customers and may therefore affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
some of our current and potential customers may view our investment in c iii communications  and its focus on the ownership  operation and sale of bandwidth capacity of a national fiber optic network unfavorably 
they may therefore be less likely to place orders with corvis for optical equipment or system services  either because they perceive us as a competitor or because of a concern that our shift in focus will divert our attention from our traditional equipment and service business 
we have discussed with some of our customers and potential customers the treatment of their proprietary information  given our new position with regard to c iii communications 
please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations subsequent event 
alienating even a small number of potential customers could have a serious impact on our business  since the number of potential customers is limited and may be reduced by ongoing consolidation in the telecommunications industry 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward looking statements 
we maintain instruments subject to interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we categorize all of our market risk sensitive instruments as non trading or other instruments 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of securities including commercial paper  certificates of deposit  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
substantially all amounts are in money market funds as well as high grade  short term commercial paper and certificates of deposit  the value of which is generally not subject to interest rate changes 
we believe that a increase or decline in interest rates would not be material to our investment income or cash flows 
our long term debt obligations bear fixed interest rates 
however  our long term debt obligations total only million  and  therefore  we do not consider the impact of any general interest rate changes to be significant 
foreign rate sensitivity we primarily operate in the united states  however  we have expanded operations to include research and development and sales offices in various european countries 
as a result  we may have sales in foreign currencies exposing us to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded 
table of contents million of sales in a foreign currency 
we are exposed to the impact of foreign currency changes  associated with the euro  for our european subsidiaries financial instruments  which are limited to cash and cash equivalents 
it is the policy of management to fund foreign operations on a monthly basis  thus minimizing average cash and overnight investments in the euro 
at december   our european subsidiaries maintained cash and cash equivalents of approximately million euros 
we believe that a increase or decline in the euro exchange ratio would not be material to cash and cash equivalent balances  interest income  or cash flows from consolidated operations
