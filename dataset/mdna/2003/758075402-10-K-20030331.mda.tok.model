summary and outlook redwood trust invests in real estate loans  both in whole loan and in securitized form 
in  we made new investments of billion in high quality residential real estate mortgage loans  million in commercial real estate loans  million in residential loan credit enhancement securities  and million in other types of real estate loan securities 
these investments were funded with new equity sourced through two equity offerings and our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment program and with new issuance of non recourse long term debt through securitization transactions 
we continue to reduce our reliance on short term recourse debt to fund our assets 
as a result  our short term recourse debt declined from of our liabilities at the beginning of the year to of our liabilities at the end of our credit results remain excellent and our asset liability posture remains well balanced 
our largest investment is in high quality residential real estate loans and related securities 
in addition  we continue to invest in commercial real estate loans and diverse types of residential and commercial real estate loan securities 
we significantly increased our staff and will continue to make material investments in building our operating capabilities and expertise 
while our operating expenses are increasing  we believe our operations have become both more capable and more productive 
our dividends for common shareholders for totaled million  or per share 
regular common dividends were per share for the year 
special dividends to common shareholders in totaled per share 
our quarterly dividend rate in the fourth quarter of was per share  we raised our regular common dividend rate to per share in the first quarter of our earnings significantly exceeded our dividend payments during the earnings we retained will fund additional real estate loan investments and thus should help increase the stability of our dividend payments and perhaps help us increase our dividend rate over time 
our gaap earnings were million  or per share for a increase from the per share we reported in and an increase from the per share we reported in 
table of contents our core earnings totaled million  or per share in a increase over the per share we earned in and a increase over the per share we earned in core earnings equal gaap earnings excluding mark to market adjustments and non recurring items 
we believe that core earnings is a useful additional measure of on going income and cash flow generation at redwood unlike gaap  core earnings does not include realized and unrealized changes in asset market values which can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and which may not reflect underlying trends in our cash flow earnings 
see table below for a detailed reconciliation of gaap earnings and core earnings 
our taxable reit income after preferred dividends was million  or per common share a increase on a per share basis over the we earned in and a increase over the per share we earned in see table below for more information on taxable reit income 
net interest income as a percentage of equity is  in our opinion  the best measure of the profitability rate of our real estate loan portfolios 
this measure was in  in  and in in  we benefited on a temporary basis from a significant drop in short term interest rates 
in  the benefits from the prior year s interest rate changes diminished  however  our portfolio profitability was enhanced in by increases in yields from our residential credit enhancement portfolio as a result of excellent credit results and faster prepayment rates and by continued favorable changes in asset mix and capital utilization a result of increased growth in our loan portfolios 
operating expense as a percentage of equity and operating expense as a percentage of net interest income are  in our opinion  the best measures of operating cost efficiency for our company 
these operating expense measures vary from quarter to quarter due to factors such as equity offerings and variable compensation expense accruals tied to earnings and dividends 
operating expense as a percentage of equity was in  in  and in operating expense as a percentage of net interest income was in  in  and in as a result of our growth in equity employed  we have been able to maintain stable operating expense ratios at the same time that we have increased our overall capabilities  supported new products initiatives  and increased performance based variable compensation payments due to favorable results 
looking at operating costs assuming a constant level of company performance so performance based compensation is normalized  our operating cost ratios have improved and we have become more productive 
our reported return on equity gaap earnings as a percentage of average gaap common equity has increased from in to in to in our core return on equity core earnings as a percentage of average core common equity has increased from in to in and in core return on equity is a measure of both earnings and equity before the potentially distorting effects of mark to market asset value fluctuations 
we believe the key longer term trends for our business are the strength of our credit results and the strength of our competitive market position 
although we recognize that the us economy is currently weak and is potentially vulnerable to external shocks  overall we believe the long term outlook for our business remains favorable 
our annual credit losses remained under one basis point of our residential real estate loan portfolios during our loan delinquency ratios have been falling 
in addition  our risk of future credit loss for portions of our residential portfolios may be reduced somewhat as a result of continued increases in housing prices in many parts of the country 
as a result of these favorable credit trends and faster prepayments  we are recognizing more income under the effective yield method from our residential credit enhancement securities portfolio 
we calculate yields for our assets using long term assumptions about prepayments  future credit losses over the life of the loans  and the timing of credit losses 
for many of our more seasoned assets  we have increased the yield we are recognizing  as relative to prior assumptions current estimates of the likely long term prepayment rates have increased  estimates of total life of the mortgage credit losses have decreased  and or estimates of the likely timing of credit losses have been extended to later years 
see the discussion on our use of effective yield methods below under critical accounting policies 
we have also reduced our credit provision expense rates for the more seasoned portions of our residential loan portfolio 
if favorable credit results  risk reduction through increasing housing prices  and faster prepayment rates continue  estimates of the long term cash flows we will receive from these assets will increase and we will thus recognize increased yields on our credit enhancement portfolio and reduced credit provision expense rates on our loan portfolios 
however  the economy is still weak  deflationary forces are still evident  and many observers believe that housing prices are vulnerable 
a reversal of our current favorable credit trends remains a real possibility 
if this occurs  the asset yields we recognize into income may 
table of contents decline and or we may incur a mark to market expense under eitf we monitor relevant market trends continuously  and revise  as appropriate  the assumptions that go into our yield calculations and credit provisions 
we believe our competitive position remains strong 
we believe we have an efficient balance sheet combined with good economies of scale  strong capabilities  and a leading market position 
over the last twelve months  we have noted an increase in competition in the form of increased demand for residential whole loans from banks  and we have occasionally noted increased demand for residential credit enhancement securities from specialized investors and for investment grade real estate securities from a variety of capital market participants 
this increased demand for assets has  at times  increased prices for some of the assets we seek to acquire 
prices generally decreased towards the end of as a result of a strong supply of newly originated mortgage assets and an uncertain economy 
we expect that prices for the assets we seek to buy may increase during any such price increases will not affect cash flows from our current assets 
given what we believe to be our strong competitive position  we believe we will continue to be able to invest in new real estate loans and securities on an attractive basis should prices rise 
our rate of acquisition  however  may slow 
our short term earnings can vary from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in interest rates  prepayment rates  asset market values  and other factors  however  we believe we are well balanced from an asset liability management perspective and we believe that it is unlikely that fluctuations in these short term factors will alter the returns we can generate over the long term 
our primary goal in managing redwood s operations is to do our best to make sure that our regular dividend rate for common shareholders remains sustainable in the long run from the cash flows generated by our assets 
we believe that our regular quarterly dividend rate of per common share as of the first quarter of is likely to be sustainable for the near future  given our current expectations for cash flow generation and other factors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies  and how changes in estimates might affect our financial results and statements  are discussed below 
management discusses the ongoing development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures provided in this form k 
establishing valuations we estimate the fair value of our assets and hedges using available market information and other appropriate valuation methodologies 
valuations of our loans are generally done on a pool basis  while valuations of all other assets are done on an individual basis 
we believe the estimates we use accurately reflect the values we may be able to receive should we choose to sell them 
our estimates are inherently subjective in nature and involve matters of uncertainty and judgment to interpret relevant market and other data 
many factors are necessary to estimate market values  including  but not limited to interest rates  prepayment rates  amount and timing of credit losses  supply and demand  liquidity  and other market factors 
in addition to our valuation processes  we are active acquirers  and occasional sellers  of the assets and hedges we own 
thus  we have the ability to understand and determine changes in assumptions that are taking place in the market place  and make appropriate changes in our assumptions for valuing assets in our portfolio 
in addition  we generally use third party sources to assist in developing our estimates 
real estate loans held for investment are carried at their unpaid principal balance adjusted for net unamortized premium or discounts and net of any allowance for credit losses 
all other assets  including securities and interest rate agreements  are reported on our balance sheet at market value 
for the most part  changes in market value of the assets we currently own are reported through our balance sheet 
however  as discussed herein  some of the changes in market value may be recorded through the income statement to the extent assets are classified as trading instruments  there are writedowns required under the provisions of eitf  or there are loan impairments 

table of contents changes in perceptions regarding future events can have a material impact on the value of our assets 
should such changes  or other factors  result in significant changes in the market values  our income and or book value could be adversely affected 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on our assets using the effective yield method 
the use of this method requires us to project cash flow over the remaining life of each asset 
such projections include assumptions about interest rates  prepayment rates  timing and amount of credit losses  when certain tests will be met that may allow for changes in payments made under the structure of securities  estimates regarding the likelihood and timing of calls of securities at par  and other factors 
there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to generate future cash flows  or the current period s yield for each asset  will prove to be accurate 
our current period earnings may not accurately reflect the yield to be earned on that asset for the remaining life of the asset 
under the effective yield method  credit losses lower than or later than anticipated by the credit loss assumptions credit reserve imbedded in our cash flow forecasts could result in increasing yields being recognized from our current portfolio 
in addition  faster than anticipated prepayment rates also tend to increase realized yields 
credit losses higher than or earlier than anticipated by our designated credit reserve and or slower than anticipated prepayment rates could result in lower yields being recognized under the effective yield method 
furthermore  adverse changes in cash flows projected may require us to take market value adjustments through our income statement under eitf yield and eitf adjustments are applied on an asset specific basis 
thus  we may take eitf charges even during a period when most of our assets perform better than anticipated and our overall portfolio is increasing 
we review our cash flow projections on an ongoing basis 
we monitor the critical performance factors for each loan and security 
our expectations of future asset cash flow performance are shaped by input and analyses received from external sources  internal models  and our own judgment and experience 
we constantly review our existing assumptions relative to our and the market s expectations of future events and make adjustments to the cash flows which may change our market values and yields 
changes in market values and yields are monitored on each asset to assure they are each accounted for according to the provisions of eitf or other applicable accounting principle 
credit reserves the method that we use to account for future credit losses depends upon the type of asset that we own 
for our credit enhancement securities  we establish a credit reserve upon the acquisition of such assets under the effective yield method of accounting 
for our residential and commercial mortgage loans  we currently establish a credit reserve based on an estimate of losses by taking credit provisions through our income statement 
for our commercial mortgage loans  we establish a credit reserve or market the value of the loan to realized value when a loan becomes delinquent 
many of the assets in our securities portfolio benefit from material forms of credit enhancement  and  thus  no credit reserves have been established to date for these assets 
for securities portfolio assets where credit losses are anticipated  we establish an appropriate reserve given the credit trends and market outlook for that asset 
as noted  one of the many significant assumptions used in projecting cash flows on many of our assets  and thus our current yield  is the level and timing of credit losses that we expect to incur over the lives of these assets 
we establish the level of future estimated credit losses as a credit reserve 
the reserve is based upon our assessment of various factors affecting our assets  including economic conditions  characteristics of the underlying loans  delinquency status  and external credit protection 
we use a variety of internal and external credit risk  cash flow modeling  and portfolio analytical tools to assist us in our assessment 
our actual credit losses  and the timing of these losses  may differ from those estimates used to establish the reserve 
such differences will result in different yields over the life of the asset than we may be currently reporting 
if such differences are adverse  and the market value of our assets declines below our carrying value  we may need to take current period mark to market charges through our income statement 
if such differences are favorable  then the current yield we are now recognizing on these assets will prove to be conservative and could be materially less than the yield we will earn over the life of the asset 
we continually review and update  as appropriate  all of our assumptions 
despite this continual review  there can be no assurance that our assumptions used to estimate cash flows  fair values  and effective yields will prove to be 
table of contents correct as interest rates  economic conditions  real estate conditions  and the market s perception of the future constantly change 
results of operations our gaap earnings were million  or per share for a increase from the per share we reported in and an increase from the per share we reported in our core earnings totaled million  or per share in a increase over the per share we earned in and a increase over the per share we earned in the table below reconciles gaap earnings to core earnings

it is calculated as gaap earnings from ongoing operations less mark to market adjustments which include realized and unrealized gains and losses on certain assets and hedges and variable stock options expense and non recurring items 
management believes that core earnings provide relevant and useful information regarding our results of operations in addition to gaap measures of performance 
this is  in part  because market valuation adjustments on only a portion of our assets and stock options and none of our liabilities are recognized through our income statement under gaap and these valuation adjustments may not be fully indicative of changes in market values on our balance sheet or a reliable guide to our current or future operating performance 
furthermore  gains or losses realized upon sales of assets vary based on portfolio management decisions  a sale of an asset for a gain or a loss may or may not affect our on going cash flow generation 
non recurring items may be unrepresentative of our current or future operating performance 
because all companies and analysts do not calculate non gaap measures such as core earnings in the same fashion  core earnings as calculated by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
net interest income net interest income after credit expenses was million in  million in  and million in net interest income growth has generally tracked growth in our net employed equity capital 
as noted in the summary  net interest income as a percentage of equity has increased from in to a to range through the last eight quarters 
during this time  we initially benefited from falling interest rates in 
as this benefit diminished in  we have benefited from an improved asset mix  fast prepayment rates on the underlying loans in our securities  and our continued strong credit results

we believe that trends in these asset based measures for redwood are not likely to be representative of trends in our true economic margins 
recent changes in these measures for redwood have been primarily a result of changes in our asset mix between loans and securities and of the different methods of presentation for these assets 
we believe that equity based margin ratios  such as net interest income as a percentage of equity  are more useful for redwood 
as shown in table  our margins as measured relative to our reported asset base have been declining due to changes in asset mix while our margins as measured relative to our equity base have been increasing 
we account for our securitizations as financings 
as a result  long term debt that is non recourse to redwood is reported on our balance sheet  as are the assets that have been sold to the non recourse securitization trusts 
if we had used different terms or forms of securitization these transactions may have been accounted for as sales 
with sales accounting  our reported balance sheet both assets and liabilities would be substantially smaller although the economics of the transaction and our exposure to risks would be unchanged 
if we structured the securitizations differently and therefore accounted for them as sales rather than financings  our asset based margins would have been different and  in some respects  reported on a basis that is more comparable to some other financial institutions 
our interest rate spread and our interest rate margin would have been higher and would show a positive trend in recent quarters 
our reported debt to equity ratio would have been substantially lower 
the table below presents our interest income and interest expense as if we had structured our securitizations to obtain sales accounting treatment rather than financing accounting treatment  effectively  on an at risk basis for assets and on a recourse basis for liabilities

most of the assets in our portfolio are adjustable rate mortgages

our retained sequoia credit enhancement securities are the first  second  and third loss pieces of the securitizations  bear the credit risk of the sequoia loans  and are the same types of assets that we acquire from third party securitizations and hold in our residential credit enhancement securities portfolio 
for our retained subordinated credit enhancement securities at december   the principal value was million of sequoia loan balances and an effective carrying value was million of sequoia loan balances 
the interest only securities we have retained from our sequoia securitizations capture the spread between the coupon rates on the underlying loans and our cost of funds on the securitized debt issued from sequoia 
these securities are rated aaa and thus have minimal credit risk 
our adjusted basis on sequoia loans at december  was of principal value  faster prepayment rates on the underlying sequoia loans would generally lead to lower realized yields on our retained interest only securities

as a result  the yields we recognize under the effective yield method of accounting have increased for these securities over the past several quarters

internal credit reserves external credit enhancement total credit protection as of total portfolio our credit enhancement securities are rated by the credit rating agencies 
for the separate residential credit enhancement securities we owned at december   have received an upgrade since our acquisition of the security of these received upgrades of two or more levels and four received downgrades one of which was downgraded by more than one level 
the following provides a summary of the characteristics of the underlying loans in the pools represented by interest we own in our credit enhancement portfolio 
this information is based on the most recent loan level detail available for each pool 
at december   we credit enhanced  loans 
of the total loans of billion  were fixed rate loans  were hybrid loans loans that are initially fixed and become adjustable to years after origination  and were adjustable rate loans 
the average size of the loans that we credit enhanced was  loans we credit enhanced with principal balances in excess of million had an average size of million and a total loan balance of billion 
these loans over million were of the total number of loans and of the total balance of loans that we credit enhanced at december  on average  our credit enhancement portfolio loans had months of seasoning at december  generally  the credit risk for seasoned loans is reduced as property values appreciate and the loan balances amortize 
the current ltv ratio for seasoned loans is often much reduced from the ltv ratio at origination 
loans with ltv s at origination in excess of made up of loan balances 
we benefit from mortgage insurance or additional pledged collateral on of these loans  serving to substantially reduce their effective ltv ratios 
the average effective ltv at origination for all the loans we credit enhance including the effect of mortgage insurance  pledged collateral  and other credit enhancements was 
given housing appreciation and loan amortization  we believe the average current effective ltv for these loans at december  was lower than 
the characteristics of the loans that we credit enhanced continued to illustrate the high quality nature of the loans 
the average fico credit score of borrowers on these residential mortgage loans for those loans where a fico score was obtained was borrowers with fico scores over comprised of this portfolio  those with scores between and comprised  those with scores between and comprised  and those with scores below comprised 
in general  loans with lower fico scores have strong compensating factors that may serve to mitigate the apparent risk of the lower fico score

thus  the yield on our commercial real estate loan portfolio has remained in a relatively stable range over the past several years 
our yield during was lower than the yield during and due to a reduction in fees recognized at the time of a loan payoff in the later period 
early payoffs generally result in the acceleration of the recognition of deferred origination fees  prepayment penalty  and exit fees

commercial mortgage loans number of loans average loan size serious delinquency realized credit losses california our goal is to secure long term non recourse debt for our commercial mortgage loans 
in  we issued million of long term debt collateralized debt for our commercial real estate mortgage loans 
at december   one of our commercial loans  totaling million of principal  was financed through long term debt in the form of commercial loan participations 
in  we acquired subordinated participations in two commercial mortgage loans originated by others 
our loan participations and our remaining commercial mortgage loans are currently financed with equity 
securities portfolio our securities portfolio consists of all the securities that we own with the exception of residential loan credit enhancement securities discussed above and cash equivalent securities 
for several years  we have been shifting the asset mix of our securities portfolio 
we have also increased our investment in those types of residential and commercial real estate loan securities primarily rated aa  a  and bbb that can be funded efficiently through the issuance of securitized long term non recourse debt 
we have been selling our fannie mae  freddie mac  and other aaa rated securities that require the use of short term recourse funding repo 
repo debt is subject to various liquidity risks  including rollover risk and collateral margin calls 
we sold the last of our securities that require repo funding during the fourth quarter of  thus completing this shift in asset mix and significantly strengthening our balance sheet 
we continue to invest in diverse real estate loan securities that are suitable for long term funding 
at december   our securities portfolio consisted of million of real estate loan securities  including prime residential  sub prime residential  manufactured housing  second lien residential  diverse commercial real estate  and real estate cdo securities 
as investors in these generally investment grade securities  we are exposed to the credit risk of the underlying mortgage loans but we also benefit from a significant degree of credit enhancement that the rating agencies require in order to give these securities an investment grade rating 
we also own equity in real estate oriented cdos 
also  in the fourth quarter of  we have made initial investments in below investment grade commercial real estate credit enhancement securities and in investment grade corporate debt issued by reits that own commercial real estate properties 
a portion of our securities portfolio was financed through long term debt through three resecuritizations completed in one of these was our first issuance of collateralized debt obligations through our acacia cdo program 
we are planning additional similar long term debt issuances in the future 
long term debt associated with our securities portfolio totaled million at december   no long term debt existed for these assets at december  short term debt associated with our securities portfolio declined from million at december  to zero at december  in the future  we anticipate funding some securities on a short term basis with short term recourse debt during the period of time we are accumulating these securities in anticipation of securitization 
all assets in our securities portfolio are reported on our balance sheet at their estimated fair value 
changes in the market value in the securities we currently own are generally reported in the balance sheet in accumulated other compensation income 
nearly all of our existing securities fall under the provisions of eitf and adverse changes in cash flows may result in market valuation adjustments to be taken through our income statement 
however  the market value of some securities may fall below our reported value  as a result of changes in interest rates or market spreads

in recent quarters  however  the trend in our cost of recourse debt has been rising  as we have changed the mix of securities and loans we fund with short term debt towards assets that are more expensive to borrow against 
our recourse debt balances have declined from million at year end to million at year end to million at year end  as we reduced short term debt balances by securitizing some assets and selling others

through september   we had not elected to obtain hedge accounting treatment under fas on any of our interest rate agreements 
thus  prior to the fourth quarter of  all our interest rate agreements were reported at fair value with any changes in values reported through our income statement under realized and unrealized mark to market adjustments 
in the fourth quarter of  due to asset growth  changes in our balance sheet  and other factors  we expanded our use of interest rate agreements 
we use these interest rate agreements to reduce earnings volatility that arises from our future and existing variable rate liabilities 
we are able to obtain cash flow hedging accounting treatment for these interest rate agreements under fas under this accounting treatment  the interest rate agreements are reported at fair market value through the balance sheet  with any ineffective portion of the hedges reflected in our income statement  either through interest expense or through our unrealized or realized mark to market valuation adjustments 
in  we recognized a minimal amount of ineffectiveness in these hedges 
at december   the accumulated other comprehensive income account in our balance sheet reflected the fair market value of these hedges of negative million

table of contents market values totaling negative million reported through our income statement in net unrealized and realized market value gains and losses 
operating expenses operating expense as a percentage of equity and operating expense as a percentage of net interest income are  in our opinion  the best measures of operating cost efficiency for our company 
although these measures vary from year to year and quarter to quarter  the general trend has been towards greater productivity  especially from a fixed cost perspective 
however  since a large portion of our operating expenses include variable compensation accruals tied to earnings and dividends  our improved performance over the past few years has increased our variable compensation expenses 
operating expense as a percentage of equity increased slightly over the last few years  from in to in and in operating expenses as a percentage of net interest income declined from in to in but then rose slightly to in if we continue to increase the scale of our business  we generally expect to benefit from operating leverage we expect growth in our operating expenses to be restrained relative to growth in equity and net interest income 
we have already achieved material improvements in productivity when measuring operating costs assuming performance based compensation is normalized ie  assuming return on equity and dividend rates the drivers of our performance based compensation system are held constant 
table operating expenses all dollars in thousands efficiency variable operating ratio performance expenses operating total fixed based average expenses operating operating operating total net interest expenses expenses expenses equity income q q q q q q q q includes operating expenses at rwt holdings  inc that were consolidated with our reported operating expenses starting january  stock option costs we currently recognize the cost of stock option issuance in our gaap financial statements in two ways 
first  in accordance with gaap  we recognize in our per share calculations the potential dilutive effect of all of our outstanding options that are in the money those that have an option strike price less than the current redwood share price 
our gaap earnings per share  which is calculated on a diluted share basis  was in without this calculation of potential dilution  reported gaap earnings per basic share was per share 
for  the difference between our average shares outstanding and average diluted shares outstanding incorporating the potential dilutive effect of options was  shares  or of our average shares outstanding 
second  we include in gaap income stock option expenses associated with a portion of our stock options that require variable accounting treatment under gaap 
this gaap expense represents the change in the in the money amount stock price less strike price  times number of options outstanding of a portion of our outstanding stock options 
this is not a cash item 
in periods of stock price appreciation  like  this expense totaled million  or per diluted share for this period 
during periods of stock price decline  this accounting treatment 
table of contents may increase our reported income for the quarter 
this expense or income is included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
since this expense is based on the market price of our common stock per share  we exclude it from our core earnings calculations 
we have not adopted the fair value method under fas as a method of accounting for stock options expenses and related items 
however  consistent with the disclosure requirements of fas and fas  we calculate the effect to earnings that this accounting treatment would provide 
these disclosures are included elsewhere in this form k under our notes to consolidated financial statements 
as shown therein  the effect to year earnings of adoption of this method of expensing stock options for accounting purposes would have reduced our reported earnings by less than mark to market adjustments changes in the market value of certain of our real estate assets and interest rate agreements affect our net income each year 
for  income statement mark to market adjustments totaled a positive million per share as compared to negative million per share in and negative million per share in we also mark to market certain assets through our balance sheet  these adjustments affect our reported book value but not our net income 
net balance sheet adjustments were positive million in per share and million per share in changes in market values were due to favorable credit and prepayment performance and  to a lesser degree  falling interest rates and other factors 
preferred stock our expense for preferred stock dividends was million in   and  reflecting a total dividend of per share on  shares outstanding 
we currently intend to convert this preferred stock into common stock when it is possible to do so under the terms of the preferred stock 
generally  this conversion is permitted when the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds per share for out of consecutive trading days 
each share of preferred stock is convertible into one share of common stock 
thus  any such conversion would result in the issuance of  new common shares 
we do not believe a preferred stock conversion would have a material affect on earnings per share 
shareholder wealth in the years since the commencement of redwood s operations  cumulative shareholder wealth has grown at a compound rate of per year 
we define shareholder wealth as growth in tangible book value per share  plus dividends paid  plus reinvestment of dividends 
in calculating shareholder wealth  we assume that dividends were reinvested through the purchase of additional shares at the prevailing book value per share 
with this assumption  the shareholder wealth we created can be compared to book value per share growth at a non reit company that has retained its earnings and compounded book value within the company 
this is a measure of management value added  not a measure of actual shareholder returns 
book value per share was in september when we commenced operations 
we increased book value to per share at december  through the retention of cash by keeping dividends lower than cash flow  net positive changes in market values of assets  issuance of stock at prices above book value  and repurchases of stock at prices below book value 
since we mark to market many of our assets through our balance sheet  reported book value is a good approximation of tangible value in the company 
cumulative dividends paid during this period were per share  and reinvestment earnings on those dividends were per share 
thus  cumulatively  shareholder wealth has increased from per share to per share during this year period 
a company that earned a after tax return on equity and retained all its earnings would have shown a similar amount of shareholder wealth growth during this period

taxable income and dividends prior to  we generally planned to distribute over time as preferred and common stock dividends of our taxable reit income earned at our parent company  redwood trust  which has elected reit status 
however  to maintain the reit status of our parent company  we need only distribute of our taxable reit income 
in the future  we may elect to retain and pay corporate income taxes on up to of our taxable reit income while continuing to maintain our reit status 
through  we have declared by the end of each calendar year dividend distributions equal to all undistributed taxable reit income from the prior year plus at least of the taxable reit income we have earned in that calendar year 
in  our dividend declarations during the year were less than the amount that would result in an distribution of year taxable reit income 
thus  we provided for an excise tax expense in the fourth quarter of million  or per share 
retained earnings are available to support future investments in real estate assets and to support future dividend payments 
our taxable reit income usually differs materially from our core earnings and reported gaap income as income calculation methods differ 
also  we conduct a portion of our real estate loan investment business in taxable subsidiaries  taxable income earned in these subsidiaries is part of gaap and core earnings but is not part of our taxable reit income and is not subject to minimum dividend distribution requirements 
we may elect to transfer a larger portion of our business to our taxable subsidiaries  which would likely have the effect of raising our tax liabilities after any net tax operating losses in these subsidiaries were utilized and reducing our minimum dividend distribution requirements  but increasing retained earnings over time 
our goal in taking any such actions would be to increase the sustainability and future growth rate of our current regular dividend 
to the extent we retain earnings  special dividend payments in the future may be reduced 
our common stock dividend policy and distributions are set by our board of directors 
generally  distributions depend on our taxable reit income  gaap earnings  core income  cash flows  overall financial condition  maintenance of reit status  and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
the board of directors may reduce our regular dividend rate when it believes it may be in the long term interest of redwood trust and its shareholders to do so 
no dividends will be paid or set apart for payment on shares of our common stock unless full cumulative dividends have been paid on our class b cumulative convertible preferred stock 
as of december   full cumulative dividends have been paid on this preferred stock 
under current policy  the board sets our regular dividend for common shareholders at a rate that it believes is more likely than not to be sustainable  given current expectations for cash flow generation and other factors 
in years when our minimum dividend distribution requirement under the reit rules exceeds what we believe to be our sustainable dividend rate  the board may declare one or more special quarterly cash dividends  or chose to defer payment of the 
table of contents dividends and pay an excise tax on a portion of the deferred distributions  or retain a portion of the income and pay income taxes on the retained portion 
distributions to our shareholders will generally be subject to tax as ordinary income  although a portion of such distributions may be designated as capital gain or may constitute a tax free return of capital 
all dividends declared and paid prior to were ordinary income 
in  our common and preferred stock regular and special dividends consisted of ordinary income and long term capital gains 
we furnish annually to each shareholder a statement setting forth distributions paid during the preceding year and their characterization as ordinary income  capital gains or return of capital 
for a discussion of the federal income tax treatment of our distributions  see federal income tax considerations taxation of holders of redwood trust s common stock elsewhere in this form k 
our board of directors may elect to maintain a steady dividend rate during periods of fluctuating reit taxable income 
in such event  the board may choose to declare dividends that include a return of capital for tax purposes 
we will generally attempt to avoid acquiring assets or structuring financings or sales at the reit corporate level that may generate distributions of unrelated business taxable income ubti or excess inclusion income to our shareholders or prohibited transaction taxes on the reit  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so

once we distribute the spillover balance  we then begin distributing our current year s taxable reit income 
the timing of the distributions of this income is dependent on the board of director s decisions regarding the amount and timing of dividend declarations and the number of common and preferred shares outstanding at the various record dates 
we intend to maintain our reit status  and meet all the distribution requirements necessary to do so 
in the future  we may retain a portion of our taxable reit income up to and pay corporate income taxes on this retained income 
this will increase our permanent equity base and should support continued growth and dividend stability

short term borrowings and liquidity our million of short term borrowings at december  had maturities of less than one year and had interest rates that changed monthly to a margin over the one month libor interest rate 
some of our short term borrowing facilities are committed for which we pay fees but most are uncommitted 
these committed facilities are generally for a term of up to one year  although certain assets maybe funded for periods of up to three years 
these committed facilities have restrictions on pledged asset types and debt covenant tests  we continue to meet these requirements 
at december   we had over a dozen uncommitted facilities for short term collateralized debt to fund higher rated securities  with credit approval in excess of billion of borrowings 
we have had no difficulty securing short term borrowings on favorable terms for these securities 
we had no outstanding borrowings under 
table of contents these agreements at december  as a result of the sale of our remaining aaa rated securities that had not been re securitized or that were not funded with equity 
this was a decrease from the million in debt outstanding at december  the amount of short term borrowings collateralized with securities will fluctuate from month to month as our acquisition and securitization programs continue 
at december   we also had three short term facilities totaling billion available to fund the residential mortgage loans that we acquire in anticipation of securitization transactions 
the amount we have outstanding at any quarter end is a function of the pace of our acquisitions relative to the timing of our securitizations 
we had million short term borrowings collateralized by residential mortgages outstanding at december   a decrease from million at december  we completed a securitization in february and used the proceeds from the long term debt issued in this securitization to pay down a portion of our short term borrowings 
the amount of short term borrowings collateralized with residential mortgage loans will fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and could be significantly higher than the million we had at december   as our acquisition and securitization programs continue 
we had five borrowing facilities for residential credit enhancement securities totaling million outstanding at december  in addition to these committed facilities  we may also finance certain of these assets through non committed borrowing arrangements 
we had no outstanding borrowings under all these agreements at december   a decrease from million at december  as we issued long term debt to refinance these assets 
the amount of short term borrowings collateralized with our residential credit enhancement securities will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as our acquisition and securitization programs continue 
our general plan is to replace short term debt funding with long term debt funding for the bulk of our assets 
we generally intend to fund the bulk of our bb rated credit enhancement securities portfolio with equity or the issuance of long term debt in the form of cdo s  re remics  or other forms of resecuritizations 
we completed our first cdo through our acacia program in the fourth quarter of we also completed a resecuritization of several of our residential credit enhancement securities in the fourth quarter of our other credit enhancement securities  those rated b or below  we generally fund with equity 
we will enter into other forms of warehousing and borrowing agreements that may facilitate the accumulation and eventual securitization of loans and securities 
at december   we had no such warehousing facility in place 
in early  we entered into one such warehousing facility to assist us in accumulating real estate securities for eventual funding through our next acacia cdo debt issuance currently scheduled for mid 
at this time  we see no material negative trends that we believe would affect our access to long term borrowings  short term borrowings  or bank credit lines sufficient to maintain safe operations  or that would suggest that our liquidity reserves would be called upon  or that would likely cause us to be in danger of a debt covenant default 
our covenants generally relate to our tangible net worth  liquidity reserves  and leverage requirements 
we have not had  nor do we currently anticipate having  any problems in meeting these covenants 
however  many factors  including ones external to us  may affect our ability to meet these covenants and may affect our liquidity in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to find or retain sufficient borrowing agreements to fund our current operations or our potential acquisition opportunities 
under our internal risk adjusted capital system  we maintain liquidity reserves in the form of cash and unpledged liquid assets 
these liquidity reserves may be needed for a variety of reasons  including a decline in the market value or a change in the acceptability to lenders of the collateral we pledge to secure short term borrowings 
we continue to maintain liquidity reserves at or in excess of our policy levels 
at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and highly liquid unpledged assets available to meet potential liquidity needs 
thus  total available liquidity equaled of our short term debt balances 
at december   we had million of liquid assets  equaling of our short term debt balances 
the improvement in this ratio in was primarily the result of replacing short term recourse borrowings with long term non recourse debt 
while we anticipate having a strong liquidity position at all times  our ratio of liquid assets to short term debt will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as we continue to fund our residential real estate loans and other securities with short term borrowings prior to securitization 

table of contents long term debt all of the billion of long term debt on our december  consolidated balance sheet was non recourse debt 
substantially all this debt billion was issued through our special purpose financing subsidiaries our sequoia program and was collateralized by residential real estate loans 
the holders of our long term debt can look for repayment only from the cash flows from the real estate specifically collateralizing the debt  the debt is non recourse to redwood 
by using this source of financing  our liquidity risks are limited 
our special purpose financing subsidiaries that issue debt have no call on redwood s general liquidity reserves  and there is no debt rollover risk as the loans are financed to maturity 
the market for aaa rated long term debt of the type that we issue to fund residential loans through sequoia is a large global market that has been relatively stable for many years 
at this time  we believe we could issue more of this debt on reasonable terms if we should choose to do so 
in february  we issued billion of long term debt through sequoia we plan to continue issuing more long term debt through our sequoia program 
of the remaining long term debt  million was backed by one commercial loan and was created through the sale of a senior commercial real estate loan participation 
the market for senior participations on commercial loans of the types in our portfolio is limited and there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell future participations 
during  we issued long term debt through two resecuritizations of our securities 
one was for a portion of our aaa and aa rated residential real estate securities portfolio and the other was for a portion of our credit enhancement securities portfolio 
at december   the outstanding long term non recourse debt on these resecuritizations totaled million 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated our cdo program acacia 
we issued million securitized long term non recourse debt collateralized by a diverse million pool of residential and commercial real estate securities  some of which we have owned for years and others that we acquired for the purpose of completing the collateral pool for this acacia transaction 
our retained subordinated interest in acacia totals million 
we intend to accumulate appropriate collateral and issue additional cdo debt in to fund this new collateral and portions of our existing portfolios 
the acacia debt issuance program helps us accomplish several objectives 
it is a source of permanent non recourse funding for our portfolio of bb rated residential credit enhancement securities we have accumulated over the years 
this method of funding lowers our liquidity risks and increases our capital efficiency relative to the short term debt funding we used in the past for this portfolio 
with greater capital efficiency  acacia together with the re securitization of other securities mentioned earlier freed up capital under our risk adjusted capital guidelines  making this capital available to support future investment growth 
if we complete additional acacia transactions in and are thus able to refinance additional portions of our existing bb rated high quality residential credit enhancement securities portfolio  we should free additional capital to support future growth 
our acacia cdo issuance program also supports our objective of increasing our investments in commercial real estate loan assets we are acquiring commercial real estate and reit debt securities that we are now able to permanently finance through cdo debt issuance transactions 
acacia also allows us to make additional investments in a broad range of residential real estate loan securities 
since we now have a means to permanently fund assorted real estate securities  we have started retaining many of the a rated and bbb rated securities we create in our sequoia securitizations 
we are also acquiring similarly rated securities from the third party securitizations we credit enhance 
in addition  since we have developed this new form of financing  we have been increasing our investment in securities backed by residential real estate loans of less than prime quality home equity loans  second liens  manufactured housing loans  sub prime  and alt a loans 
the credit ratings for these securities are generally investment grade aaa to bbb 
although the real estate loans underlying these securities are lower quality than the loans we acquire for our retained loan portfolio and the loans we credit enhance through the acquisition of residential credit enhancement securities  the amount of external credit support in our favor within these securitization structures is substantial 
we believe the likelihood of credit loss on these investment grade rated securities is no higher than on the bulk of other securities we own that are backed by higher quality loans but are lower rated and thus have lesser amounts of credit enhancement 
we believe we have some competitive advantages as a cdo issuer and manager 
we are well capitalized relative to many issuers 
we may have lower operating costs than other cdo issuers because  as a part of our existing business  we already have in place much of the infrastructure and experienced staff required to support a cdo 
table of contents issuance program 
we may have an advantage in accumulating collateral  as we create in house a good volume of assets through our sequoia program that are attractive as cdo collateral 
we retain the equity in our cdos rather than selling it  as a result  we can structure lower risk transactions we are willing to take a lower return for lower risk as compared to many buyers of cdo equity 
in addition  since we are not seeking to sell the cdo equity  it may be easier for us to complete cdo issuance transactions in difficult markets 
pursuing a cdo issuance program entails a number of risks  including assuming the credit risks of diverse types of underlying real estate loan collateral  certain hedging and asset liability management risks  and the risk of not being able to complete a debt issuance at favorable levels after having accumulated a collateral pool 
other risks are reduced through our acacia cdo debt issuance program 
for instance  significant liquidity risks are reduced through securing long term non recourse financing for assets we formerly financed on short term recourse debt basis 
we are excited about the potential for our acacia cdo program because it increases and diversifies our real estate investment opportunities while  on the whole  generally decreasing or diversifying many of our risks 
we intend to continue to create and retain attractive long term assets through our acacia cdo program 
equity capital and risk adjusted capital guidelines excluding short term debt and long term securitized debt  we are capitalized entirely by common and preferred equity capital 
our equity base increased  from million to million in as a result of million in asset appreciation  million in retention of cash flow  equity offerings totaling million  and million in stock issuance through our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment program 
we will seek to raise additional equity capital in the future when opportunities to expand our business are attractive and when we believe such issuance is likely to benefit long term earnings and dividends per share 
the amount of assets that can be supported with a given capital base is limited by our internal risk adjusted capital policies 
our risk adjusted capital policy guideline amounts are expressed in terms of an equity to assets ratio and vary with market conditions and asset characteristics 
our risk adjusted capital guideline is further discussed under capital risks below 
at december   our aggregate equity capital guidelines were of our residential credit enhancement securities  of net retained interests in our residential loan portfolio after long term debt issuance sequoia equity  of our short term debt funded residential mortgage loans under accumulation for securitization  of net retained interests in our resecuritizations and cdos  to of our short term debt funded securities portfolio under accumulation for securitization  and of our commercial real estate loan portfolio 
our total risk adjusted capital guideline amount for assets on our balance sheet was million at december  capital required for outstanding commitments at december  for asset purchases settling in was million 
thus  at december   our total capital committed was million  our total capital available was million  and our excess capital to support growth for was million 
we intend to support most of our planned growth in using this excess capital plus capital freed up through additional long term debt issuance 
we intend to continue additional equity issuance at modest levels through our direct stock purchase and dividend reinvestment program 
if investment opportunities remain attractive and we anticipate achieving material balance sheet growth  we may seek to issue stock through an underwritten offering during balance sheet leverage we believe our balance sheet is strong  given the favorable liquidity and risk limiting characteristics of our non recourse securitized long term debt  our very low levels of leverage on a recourse basis  and the quality of our assets 
as reported on our balance sheet of december   our equity to reported assets ratio was and our reported debt to equity ratio was times 
however  a majority of our debt is non recourse debt 
holders of non recourse debt can look only to the pledged assets and not to redwood for repayment 
therefore  another useful measure of the leverage we employ is to compute leverage ratios comparing our equity base to our recourse debt levels and to our at risk assets our assets excluding those assets pledged to non recourse debt 
these adjustments generally conform our balance sheet to what would be reported if we accounted for our securitizations as sales rather than as financings 
total reported assets at december  were billion  of these  billion were pledged to non recourse debt and billion were at risk 
total reported liabilities at december  were billion  non recourse debt was billion and recourse debt was billion 
on a recourse only basis  our ratio of equity to at risk assets was and our ratio of recourse debt to equity was times 

table of contents please also see net interest income above for a discussion of our income statement as reformatted to a recourse basis 
at december   we had replaced most of our short term recourse debt with long term non recourse debt 
we believe our primary use of short term debt in will be to fund the accumulation of residential loans for securitization in our sequoia program and the accumulation of diverse real estate securities for securitization in our acacia cdo program 
depending on the rate of accumulation and the timing of securitizations  short term debt levels will vary 
average short term debt balances will likely materially exceed the million of short term debt we had at december  as we continue to accumulate and securitize assets and account for these securitizations as financings rather than as sales  the apparent leverage on our reported balance sheet will likely increase 
on a recourse basis  however  we believe our leverage is likely to remain at levels that we believe are modest for a financial institution 
unlike most financial institutions  redwood s risk with respect to its investments in loans and securities is limited after securitization to the amount of capital redwood initially contributes to each securitization transaction 
although we assume credit risk on over billion of real estate loans  our maximum loss with respect to our assets that have been securitized is capped at a level that is less than our total capital base 
we believe we could potentially remain solvent even while sustaining significant credit losses sufficient in size to call into question the solvency of many other financial institutions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the risks inherent in our business including credit risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  market value risks  reinvestment risk  and capital risks in a prudent manner designed to insure redwood s longevity 
at the same time  we endeavor to provide our shareholders an opportunity to realize a steady and rising dividend and an attractive total rate of return through stock ownership in our company 
in general  we seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risks that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage such risks  to earn sufficient compensation to justify the taking of such risks  and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we do take 
credit risk the majority of our credit risk comes from high quality residential real estate loans 
this includes residential real estate loans we own and loans we effectively guarantee or insure through acquisitions of credit enhancement securities 
we are exposed to credit risks in our commercial real estate loan portfolio 
our securities portfolio is also exposed to credit risk and we have credit risk with counter parties with whom we do business 

table of contents the establishment of a credit reserve for loans and our future credit loss assumptions for securities to calculate long term yields under the effective yield method under gaap accounting does not reduce our taxable income or our dividend payment obligations as a reit 
for taxable income  many of our credit expenses will be recognized only as incurred 
thus  the timing and recognition of credit losses for gaap and tax  and for our earnings and our dividends  may differ 
credit losses may not affect our gaap income due to our anticipation of such losses and our credit reserves but could materially reduce our dividend payment obligations 
conversely  our dividend payment obligations may remain high even during periods when future credit losses are expected but have not yet been realized 
the method that we use to account for future credit losses depends upon the type of asset that we own 
for our credit enhancement securities  we establish a credit reserve upon the acquisition of such assets under the effective yield method of accounting 
in addition  first loss and other credit enhancement interests that we do not own that are junior to our positions act as a form of external credit reserve for us on a specific asset basis for some of our assets  these interests junior to ours absorb credit losses in specific pools of underlying real estate loans before our interest in that pool of loans will experience losses 
for our residential real estate loans  we currently establish a credit reserve based on an estimate of losses by taking credit provisions through our income statement 
for our commercial real estate loans  we establish a credit reserve or mark the loan to estimated realizable value when a loan becomes delinquent 
many of the assets in our securities portfolio benefit from material forms of credit enhancement  and  thus  no credit reserves have been established to date for these assets 
for securities portfolio assets where credit losses are anticipated  we establish an appropriate reserve given the credit trends and market outlook for that asset 
liquidity risk our primary form of financing is the issuance from bankruptcy remote securitization trusts of long term non recourse debt that very closely matches the interest rate  prepayment rate  and maturities of our assets that we sell to the trusts and that secure the debt issued from these trusts 
once the trusts issue this debt  redwood s recourse exposure to the underlying assets is limited to our net investment in the trusts after debt issuance 
we believe this is a secure and robust form of financing that effectively eliminates liquidity risk for this portion of our balance sheet  materially limits our credit risk exposure to the amount we have invested  and eliminates a variety of other potential risks as well 
as a part of our long term planning  we generally intend to keep our short term recourse debt at reasonable levels consistent with our plan using short term debt to fund our accumulation of assets for securitization and then replacing this short term debt with non recourse debt through the securitization transaction 
our primary liquidity risk arises when we finance long maturity mortgage assets with short term debt during the accumulation period 
even if the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities are well matched  maturities may not be matched 
trends in the liquidity of the capital markets in general may affect our ability to rollover short term debt 
at december   we had million of short term debt collateralized by assets 
all this debt was collateralized by high quality residential real estate loans under accumulation for future securitizations 
if our short term debt was called  or we could not renew borrowing facilities  or we could not complete a securitization  or the credit quality of the assets deteriorated rapidly  we may need to sell assets in a potentially unfavorable environment 
there can be no assurance that such sales would satisfy our liabilities 
the table below presents our contractual obligations as of december  the debt appears on our balance sheet 
the operating leases are commitments that are expensed as per terms of the contracts 
additional information on these obligations is presented in our notes to consolidated financial statements

we plan to move our executive office to this new location in the third quarter of our obligation under this new lease extends to and totals million 
interest rate risk our strategy is to maintain an asset liability posture that is effectively match funded so that the achievement of our long term goals is unlikely to be affected by changes in interest rates  yield curves  or loan prepayment rates 
at december   the interest rate characteristics of our debt  as adjusted for outstanding interest rate agreements  closely matched the interest rate characteristics of our assets that were funded with debt 
we had billion of adjustable rate debt funding adjustable rate assets 
we had billion of fixed hybrid debt funding a portion of our fixed hybrid assets 
the remainder of our assets mostly hybrid and fixed rate assets  but also a portion of our variable rate assets were funded with our billion of equity 
as a part of our current asset liability strategy  we have been maintaining a slight mismatch between the interest rate adjustment periods of our adjustable rate debt and our adjustable rate assets 
we have been reducing the amount of this mismatch over time through hedging and through issuing long term debt with longer adjustment frequencies we may further reduce the amount of this mismatch during primarily this mismatch arises because we own six month libor assets funded with one month libor debt billion of our assets and liabilities were so situated at december  see table below 
the interest rate on this debt adjusts each month to the current one month libor interest rate plus a margin 
the interest rate on the six month libor assets adjusts more slowly to market conditions  each month the coupon rate on approximately one sixth of these assets adjusts to the current six month libor interest rate plus a margin 
any single change in short term interest rates could thus have some short term effect on our earnings generally  for the next several quarters 
to the extent that this mismatch remains on our balance sheet  we would expect that the spread between our asset yields and our cost of borrowed funds would be more favorable in a falling short term interest rate environment than in a rising short term interest rate environment 
this trend may be partially or fully offset over time by the equity funded portion of our balance sheet  which would generally have increasing net interest income and perhaps better credit results in a rising rate environment 
short term interest rates fell throughout  and our earnings temporarily benefited from our short term interest rate mismatch 
as short term interest rates have stabilized in  our earnings benefit from this source diminished 
however  short term interest rates fell again in november  assuming short term interest rates remain unchanged after this decline  we expect to continue to benefit on a temporary basis in first quarter of from the november rate decrease 
in the last few years  we have generally been able to achieve our desired asset liability mix on balance sheet without significant use of derivatives 
as the table below shows  our variable rate assets are generally funded with variable rate debt and our unhedged fixed rate assets are generally funded with equity 
we believe that our use of interest rate derivative agreements as part of our asset liability strategy is likely to increase in the future as we expand our portfolios  develop our cdo long term debt issuance program  and acquire more fixed rate and hybrid assets that may need to be hedged prior to securitization 
a detailed discussion of our interest rate agreements is provided above and in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
in combination with a like amount of variable rate debt  these agreements effectively create fixed rate debt or extend effective maturity of adjustable rate debt eg  from a one month liability to a six month liability 
net payments or receipts on our interest rate agreements are included in interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents during  we reduced the amount of net fixed rate assets we own fixed rate or hybrid assets that are not hedged or funded with fixed rate debt relative to the size of our equity base 
net fixed assets equaled of equity at december  and of equity at december  this reduction in net fixed rate assets diminishes current period income  but also should allow relative to the net fixed rate exposure we had at the beginning of the year for increased earnings and more stable book value in a rising interest rate environment 
unlike many financial institutions  we have not owned nor do we plan to own fixed or hybrid assets funded with short term floating rate debt

changes in interest rates can have many effects on our business aside from those discussed in this section  including effects on our liquidity  market values  and loan prepayment rates 
prepayment risk we seek to maintain an asset liability posture that mitigates the effects loan prepayment trends may have on our ability to achieve our long term objectives 
for the development of our business  there are both positive and negative aspects to both slower prepayment rate environments and to faster prepayment rate environments 
prepayments affect earnings in the near term primarily through amortization of purchase premium and discount 
although we have roughly equal amounts of premium and discount  amortization income from discount assets may not necessarily offset amortization expenses from premium assets 
variations in current and projected prepayment rates for individual assets and changes in short term interest rates as they effect projected coupons on adjustable rate mortgages  and thus change effective yield calculations may cause net premium amortization expense or net discount amortization income to vary substantially from quarter to quarter 
in the longer term  prepayments affect reinvestment risk and opportunity 
we spend considerable effort acquiring and creating new real estate loan assets for redwood 
these assets support the long term stability of our common stock dividend payments 
most of our retained assets are structured to be long term typically to year assets even if the underlying loan collateral prepays quickly 
nevertheless  if fast prepayment rates persist over long periods of time  we will have more capital returned to us sooner than would otherwise be the case 
we will then need to reinvest this capital  and the assets we acquire and create at that time may be more or less attractive than the assets that generated the principal repayments

market value risk at december   we owned billion of assets that were marked to market through our balance sheet but not through our income statement 
of these assets  had adjustable rate coupons  were hybrid loans  and the remaining had fixed rate coupons 
market value fluctuations of these assets can affect the reported value of our stockholders equity base 
at december   we owned real estate loans totaling million that we account for on a mark to market basis in the case of mortgage loans  on a lower of cost or market basis for purposes of determining reported earnings 
all these assets had adjustable rate coupons 
market value fluctuations for our assets not only affect our reported earnings and book value  but also can affect our liquidity especially to the extent these assets are funded with short term borrowings 
recently  we have been increasing the amount of interest rate agreements we own 
please see our discussion above under interest rate risk and in our notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our interest rate agreements 
our interest rate agreements are reported at market value with any periodic changes reported through either our income statement or in our balance sheet 
adverse changes in the market values of our interest rate agreements which would generally be caused by falling interest rates may require us to devote substantial amounts of cash to collateral calls 
capital risk our capital levels  and thus our access to borrowings and liquidity  may be tested  particularly if market values of our assets that secure our short term borrowings decline or the market for short term borrowings changes in an adverse manner 
through our risk adjusted capital policy  we assign a guideline capital adequacy amount expressed as a guideline equity to assets ratio to each of our real estate loan assets 
for short term funded assets  this ratio may fluctuate over time  based on changes in that asset s credit quality  liquidity characteristics  potential for market value fluctuation  interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and the over collateralization requirements for that asset set by our collateralized short term lenders 
capital requirements for securities rated below aa  residential credit enhancement interests  retained interests from our sequoia and acacia securitizations  commercial real estate whole loans  and retained commercial real estate junior loan participants are generally higher than for higher rated 
table of contents securities and residential whole loans 
capital requirements for less liquid assets depend chiefly on our access to funding for these assets  the number of sources of such funding  the funding terms  and the amount of extra capital we decide to hold on hand to protect against possible liquidity events with these assets 
capital requirements for our retained interests in our long term debt securitizations generally equal our net investment 
the sum of the capital adequacy amounts for all of our mortgage assets is our aggregate capital adequacy guideline amount 
we do not expect that our actual capital levels will always exceed the guideline amount 
if interest rates were to rise in a significant manner  our capital guideline amount may rise  as the potential interest rate risk of our short term debt funded assets would increase  at least on a temporary basis  due to periodic and life caps and slowing prepayment rates for real estate assets 
we measure all of our assets funded with short term debt at estimated market value for the purpose of making risk adjusted capital calculations 
our actual capital levels  as determined for our risk adjusted capital policy  would likely fall as rates increase and as the market values of our assets  net of any mark to market gains on hedges  decrease 
such market value declines may be temporary  as future coupon adjustments on adjustable rate real estate loans may help to restore some of the lost market value 
in this circumstance  or any other circumstance in which our actual capital levels decreased below our capital adequacy guideline amount  we would generally cease the acquisition of new assets until capital balance was restored through prepayments  interest rate changes  or other means 
in certain cases prior to a planned equity offering or other circumstances  our board of directors may authorize management to acquire assets in a limited amount beyond the usual constraints of our risk adjusted capital policy 
inflation risk virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates  changes in interest rates  and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and  as a reit  our dividends must equal at least of our net taxable reit income as calculated for tax purposes 
in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
quantitative information about market risk the table below incorporates information that may be useful in analyzing certain market value risks on our balance sheet 
one scenario regarding potential future principal prepayments and interest rates of our assets and liabilities is presented in this table 
there are many assumptions used to generate this information and there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur as anticipated 
future sales  principal repayments  acquisitions  calls  and restructuring could materially change our interest rate risk profile 
for our interest rate sensitive assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by year of maturity 
the forward curve future interest rates as implied by the yield structure of debt markets as of december  was used to project the average coupon rates for each year presented  based on the existing characteristics of our portfolio 
the timing of principal cash flows includes assumptions on the prepayment speeds of these assets based on their recent prepayment performance and future prepayment performance consistent with this interest rate scenario  actual prepayment speeds could vary significantly from these assumptions 
furthermore  this table does not include anticipated credit losses and assumes all of the principal we are entitled to receive will be received 
the actual amount and timing of credit losses will affect the principal payments and effective rates during all periods 
as discussed throughout this form k our future earnings are sensitive to a number of factors and changes in these factors may have a variety of secondary effects that  in turn  will also impact our earnings 
in addition  one of the key factors in projecting our income is the reinvestment rate on new assets and there is no reinvestment assumed in this table 
the information provided in this table is based on our existing portfolio at december  under one set of assumptions
