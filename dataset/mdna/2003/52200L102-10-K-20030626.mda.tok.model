table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations since the beginning of fiscal year  the company has increased its number of centers from centers to company owned and franchised centers at march  we have achieved this growth through a combination of acquisitions including the acquisition of tutor time centers in july  prototype build to suit centers  and new leases 
fiscal growth consisted of three new build to suit leased centers and one management contract 
during fiscal  we closed under performing centers  of which had been identified in our restructuring plan at the prior fiscal year ended march  with the acquisition of tutor time in fiscal  the company acquired and accepted the contracts on operating corporate centers  operating franchise centers  and additional tutor time centers that were at various stages of development 
the company is subject to certain risks common to the providers of child care and early education  including dependence on key personnel  dependence on client relationships  competition from alternate sources or providers of the company s services  market acceptance of work and family services  the ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  the company s ability to manage its overall cost structure and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies childtime prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these statements management makes certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the amounts of revenue and expenses for each period presented 
the application of the company s accounting policies  in certain instances  requires the exercise of judgment and assumptions that pertain to future uncertainties and as a result  actual future results could differ from management s estimates 
the accounting policies management believes are critical in the preparation of the company s financial statements relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets  liability for workers compensation insurance obligations  and income taxes 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  which requires that the following criteria be met before recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s revenues consist primarily of tuition paid by parents  supplemented in some cases by payments either partial or in total from government agencies 
each agency has its own set of guidelines in administering subsidies and management must constantly monitor affected centers to ensure compliance 
revenues also include  to a lesser degree  management fees paid by corporate sponsors and franchise royalties and fees 
tuition revenue is recognized as services are performed 
in some centers  the company receives payment in advance of services being rendered  in which case  revenue is deferred until the services have been provided 
franchise fees and site development fees are recognized as revenue at the time the franchise center receives a certificate of occupancy 
royalty income related to franchise operations is recognized as revenue is earned by franchisees 
accounts receivable 
the company generates accounts receivable primarily from fees charged to governmental agencies  franchisees and  to a lesser degree  parents 
the company monitors collections and payments from these customers and maintains a provision for estimated losses based on historical trends and current overall economic conditions 
amounts charged to this provision for uncollectible accounts receivable have historically been within the company s expectations  but there can be no assurance that future experience will be consistent with the company s past experience 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets under sfas and sfas during the second quarter of  the company completed the implementation of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas the company employed a discounted cash flow analysis to compute fair value in conducting its impairment tests under sfas the company also tests for long lived asset impairment  which consists primarily of equipment  
table of contents leasehold improvements and other assets  as of october   in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company employed a cash flow analysis in conducting its impairment test 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company again tested for impairment using the discounted  forecasted cash flows for the three segments of the company childtime corporate  tutor time corporate and franchise operations 
these cash flows were compared to the fair value of intangible and long lived assets for each segment  and it was determined that there was no further impairment for fiscal assumptions and estimates about future cash flows are subjective in nature and can be affected by a variety of factors  such as the economy  regulatory changes and changes in state mandated programs 
there is a potential for impairment charges in future years that would reduce operating income and asset values on our balance sheet 
liability for workers compensation insurance obligations 
the company self insures a significant portion of its workers compensation insurance plans 
the full extent of certain liabilities  in many cases  may not become fully recognized for several years 
the company  therefore  estimates the potential obligation for liabilities which have been incurred but not yet reported based upon historical data and experience  and utilizes an outside consulting firm to assist the company in developing these estimates 
although management believes that the amounts accrued for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in either the number of claims and or costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on the company s financial results

operating expenses of learning centers 
operating expenses for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal to million

these costs were partially offset by other operating costs  which decreased 
for fiscal  operating expenses as a percentage of revenue from learning center operations increased to  from for fiscal this increase was a result of higher operating costs in the acquired tutor time centers  costs incurred in center openings and closings  and higher childtime center costs

the company expects to fund cash needs through the revolving credit facility  described below  and cash generated from operations  although alternative forms of funding continue to be evaluated and new arrangements may be entered into in the future 
the company experienced decreased liquidity during the calendar year end holidays due to decreased attendance 
while new enrollments are generally highest during the traditional fall back to school period and after the calendar year end holidays  enrollment generally decreases during the summer months and calendar year end holidays 
should cash flow generated from operations and borrowings available under the revolving credit facility not be adequate to provide for its working capital and debt service needs  the company will attempt to make other arrangements to provide needed liquidity

interest rates 
the company has exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related to its debt obligations
