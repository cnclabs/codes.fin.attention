no assurance can be given that we will be immune to this trend 
if the product cycle for our systems proves to be shorter than management anticipates  our pricing structure and revenues could be impaired 
in addition  in order to remain competitive  we may be required to expend a greater percentage of our revenues on product innovation and development than has historically been the case 
in either case  our gross profit margins and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see certain factors affecting forward looking statements in part i  item of this annual report 
compared to revenue total revenues increased from  in to  in primarily due to increases in software license and services revenues 
software revenue increased from  in to  in as a result of increased sales in the firstwave ecrm product

total revenues from international sources  which includes maintenance  software license fees and customizations  increased from of total revenues in to in due to increased software and services revenue from our uk subsidiary 
revenues from firstwave uk contributed the majority of international revenues with only a nominal amount of revenue derived from international distributors 
the decrease in revenue derived from international distributors is related to the decreased use of our takecontrol product by international customers 
although we have begun renewing our relationships with distributors in europe and australia and look forward to activity from these distributors related to the ecrm product  there has been limited activity thus far 
during  we expect revenue derived from us sources to increase  with revenues from our uk subsidiary continuing to exceed our us revenues 
services revenues increased from  in to  in the increase in services revenue is primarily due to two large services engagements 
both of these engagements  being handled by our uk subsidiary  represent of our total services revenues for the year to date increases in software and services revenues are primarily due to revenues generated through our uk subsidiary and our partnership with a leading global services company 
we expect that the revenues from this partnership will remain at high levels for the first part of based upon projects already in process 
if this partner decreases its purchasing of our software and services  our revenues would be subject to significant decrease if they were not replaced with other significant accounts 
we are aggressively pursuing strategies to transition our revenue stream away from dependency on a few large customers to a more diverse customer base 
maintenance revenues decreased from  in to  in primarily as the result of cancellations of maintenance agreements of customers who were using the takecontrol and firstwave for unix product lines

during  we anticipate continued increases in sales and marketing expenses as we continue to implement marketing programs focused on creating awareness  generating qualified leads  and development of new marketing channels 
if the resulting projected revenues do not increase as quickly as expected  or at the rate we expect  we may experience an adverse impact on our business and operating results 
product development expense the company s product innovation and development expenditures  which include amounts capitalized  increased from  in to  in  and increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in software development costs capitalized increased from  in to  in the increase is primarily related to increased payroll costs related to an increase in development personnel and increased used of outside consultants related to enhancements to the ecrm product line

income tax expense decreased from  in to  in fas  accounting for income taxes specifies that deferred tax assets are to be reduced by a valuation allowance if any of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
a valuation allowance increase of  was provided in resulting in the deferred tax asset being fully covered by a valuation allowance  thereby netting to zero on the consolidated balance sheet 
preferred stock the series a and series b preferred stock agreements contained a mandatory redemption feature whereby the sale  lease  exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the company were regarded as liquidation events and were thereby required to be shown outside shareholder s equity in our consolidated financial statements as of december  on july   the company s board of directors unanimously approved the consent and agreement to be entered into by the holders of series a convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock to waive their rights with respect to these deemed liquidation provisions 
on july   the holders of all outstanding shares of the series a and series b convertible preferred stock executed the consent and agreement and waived their rights with respect to the deemed liquidation provisions

property and equipment increased from  at december  to  at december  due to fixed asset purchases offset by year to date depreciation and disposals 
capitalized software increased from  at december  to  at december  due to additional capitalization of  in development costs net of  in amortization 
during we anticipate the continued increase in this asset  as we are expecting the additional capitalization to exceed the amount of amortization

deferred revenue increased from  at december  to  at december  due to increased annual maintenance billings related to the ecrm product line

on july   firstwave signed an agreement with extreme logic  microsoft s partner of the year  to provide a 
net based workflow and scripting engine and services to enhance our ecrm technology 
by licensing this proven technology  we feel the technology risk associated with new development is diminished  we gain a time to market advantage  and the cost to develop is less than building the technology in house 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to maintain positive cash flows  as well as the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and expansion of sales and marketing  and market acceptance of our products 
our future capital needs will be highly dependent upon our ability to control expenses and generate additional software license revenues  and any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if we are unable to fund expenses from operations or obtain the necessary additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  as well as reduce the size of current staff  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and our ability to reduce losses or generate profits 
we capitalized  in software development costs during  as compared to  during these amounts relate to continued development and enhancements to our firstave ecrm product

taxes as of december   we had general business tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which will expire in through we also have us net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax reporting purposes of approximately  the carryforwards expire at various dates beginning through the internal revenue code contains provisions that limit the use in any future period of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards upon the occurrence of specific events 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue from software product sales upon shipment of the product when we have a signed contract  the fees are fixed and determinable  no significant obligations remain  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time we recognize revenue 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed 
maintenance revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis over the term of the maintenance agreements 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including installation and integration services  are recognized as each element is earned based on objective evidence of the relative fair values of each element and when there are no undelivered elements essential to the functionality of the delivered element 
international revenues are primarily generated by firstwave uk and to a lesser extent by independent distributors who offer licenses of the company s products in specific geographic areas 
under the terms of the company s independent international distributor agreements  international distributors collect license fees and maintenance revenues on our behalf  and generally remit to of standard license fees and maintenance revenues they produce 
we recognize international sales at the gross license amount  with the amount paid to the distributors reflected as a selling expense 
our international maintenance fees are reflected as maintenance revenues  with the amount retained by distributors shown as a cost of maintenance revenue 
revenues from nonmonetary exchanges are recorded at the fair value of the products and services provided or received  whichever is more clearly evident 
advanced billings for services and maintenance contracts are recorded as deferred revenue on the company s balance sheet  with services revenue recognized as the services are performed and on a pro rata basis for maintenance 
software development costs capitalized software development costs consist principally of salaries  contract services  and certain other expenses related to development and modifications of software products capitalized in accordance with the provisions of fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
capitalization of such costs begins only upon establishment of technological feasibility as defined in fas and ends when the resulting product is available for sale 
all costs incurred to establish the technological feasibility of software products are classified as research and development and are expensed as incurred 
software development costs which are capitalized are subsequently reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value 
amortization of capitalized software costs is provided at the greater of the ratio of current product revenue to the total of current and anticipated product revenue or on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the software  which is not more than three years 
it is possible that those estimates of anticipated product revenues  the remaining estimated economic life of the product  or both could be reduced due to changing technologies 
quarterly financial data unaudited the table below sets forth certain unaudited operating results for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended december  this information has been prepared on the same basis as the financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document and includes all adjustments necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
our operating results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

quantitative and qualitative market risk disclosure the company is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
currently  the company maintains its cash position primarily in money market funds and other bank accounts 
the company does not currently engage in hedging activities or otherwise use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its financial assets 
although a decrease in interest rates could reduce our interest income  at this time management does not believe a change in interest rates will materially affect the company s financial position or results of operations 
we do not have any material credit facilities and  therefore  do not have a significant risk due to potential fluctuations in interest rates for loans at this time 
changes in interest rates could make it more costly to borrow money in the future and may impede our future acquisition and growth strategies if management determines that the costs associated with borrowing funds are too high to implement these strategies 
the results of operations of our wholly owned subsidiary located in surrey  england are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of this subsidiary are translated from the local currency to us dollars upon consolidation 
because of the significance of the operations of this subsidiary to our consolidated operations  as exchange rates vary  net sales and other operating results  when translated  may differ materially from our prior performance and our expectations 
in addition  because of the significance of our overseas operations  we could also be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products and further negatively impact the results of our operations in a material and adverse manner 
as a result of these market risks  the price of our stock could decline significantly and rapidly
