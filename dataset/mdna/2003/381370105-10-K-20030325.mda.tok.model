item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to fixed price electrical construction contracts  real estate development projects and deferred income tax assets 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
a number of factors relating to our electrical construction segment affect the recognition of contract revenue 
the company recognizes revenue when electrical services are performed except when work is performed under a fixed price contract 
revenue from fixed price construction contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
under this method  estimated contract income and resulting revenue is generally accrued based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by changes in productivity  scheduling  and the unit cost of labor  subcontracts  materials and equipment 
additionally  external factors such as weather  client needs  client delays in providing approvals  labor availability and governmental regulation  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and thus the timing of income and revenue recognition 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
revenue from change orders  extra work  variations in the scope of work and claims is recognized when realization is reasonably assured 
given our limited experience in condominium development  the initial condominium development project was accounted for under the deposit method  thus deferring the recognition of related revenue and expenses until the project was complete and the underlying titles were transferred to the buyers 
commencing with the second condominium development project  all revenue associated with real estate development projects that meet the criteria specified by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for sales of real estate will be recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under this method  revenue is recognized when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  buyers are unable to receive refunds of down payments except in the event of non delivery  a substantial percentage of the condominiums are under firm contracts  collection of the sales price is reasonably assured and sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognized is calculated based on the percentage of completion  as determined by the fixed price construction contract costs incurred to date in relation to the total fixed price construction contract 
if a buyer were to default on the contract for sale  revenues and expenses recognized in prior periods would be adjusted in the period of default 
a significant majority of the total estimated project costs is attributable to the fixed price construction contract  the residual estimated costs could vary from actual 
if a current estimate of total project cost indicates a loss on a project  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
the timing of revenue and expense recognition is contingent on construction productivity 
factors possibly impeding construction productivity include  but are not limited to  supply of labor  materials and equipment  scheduling  permitting and unforeseen events 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event the company were to subsequently determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the previously recorded valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations segment information the table below shows the company s consolidated revenue and operating income attributable to each of its ongoing lines of business for each of the years in the three year period ended december  revenue electrical construction real estate total operating income loss electrical construction real estate total year ended december compared to year ended december  continuing operations revenues total revenues in the year ended december  increased by to  compared to  in the year ended december  this increase in total revenues was primarily the result of a significant increase in revenues generated by the real estate operations  which were partially offset by a decrease in the electrical construction operation s revenue 
electrical construction revenue decreased by in the year ended december  to  from  in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in both transmission line construction and fiber optic projects as a result of a decline in the demand for the construction and maintenance services provided to electrical utilities 
there was no revenue earned from fiber optic projects during during the first quarter of  the company has been awarded to date approximately million in new energy construction projects 
the company believes that this high level of new contract awards may suggest the beginning of a rebound in the electrical construction industry 
revenues recognized by the real estate operations for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of  this significant increase was attributed to the completion and sale of the company s first condominium development project  a twelve unit riverfront complex in cocoa beach  country club point  as well as partial revenue recognition on the second condominium development project  a six unit oceanfront complex near cocoa beach  riomar 
country club point was accounted for under the deposit method  accordingly  related revenue and expenses were deferred until the sale of the condominiums occurred and the underlying titles were transferred to the buyers 
riomar is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
the company expects riomar to be completed in the summer of five of the six units are currently under contract for sale 
cape club  a sixteen unit oceanfront condominium project is currently in the permitting pre development phase 
eight units are under contract for sale and three units  which are currently reserved  are in the process of being converted to contracts for sale 
construction on cape club is expected to commence in spring and to be completed in the second quarter of commencement of construction is dependent upon the receipt of required permits 
oak park  a townhouse style condominium project in cape canaveral  is currently in the planning permitting phase 
preliminary plans call for a forty unit complex  four of which have been reserved with refundable deposits 
construction is expected to commence in the latter part of the company s most recent plans are to develop a riverfront combination residential and commercial complex on a two acre parcel in melbourne acquired in january for approximately million 
initial plans call for a multi phase development  with the first phase  pineapple house  a thirty three unit luxury riverfront condominium complex 
additional phases may include additional residential condominiums and commercial buildings

as a percentage of revenue  operating margins on electrical construction operations decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the operating margin was a result of a net increase in transmission line construction costs as a percentage of revenue 
the net increase was comprised of an increase  as a percentage of revenue  in insurance and depreciation costs  partially offset by a decrease in incentive bonuses incurred due to a lower level of profitability for the year ended december   in comparison to the year ended december  the varying magnitude and duration of electrical construction projects may result in substantial fluctuation in the company s backlog from time to time

the most significant deferred tax asset was a net operating loss nol carryforward 
based on negative evidence  such as successive years of tax losses  future income projections and nol carryforward limitations it was determined  based on all information available at the time  that the company either would not use the nol carryforward or could not produce  with reasonable accuracy  information to support utilization of the carryforward 
during and  management determined that there was no need for a valuation allowance based on the following positive evidence sufficient taxable income was generated during the years that were offset by net operating loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance previously existed 
management determined that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of the nol s would be utilized prior to their expiration date 
the taxable income resulted from favorable operating results of the company s electrical construction subsidiary that could not reasonably have been projected in a prior period
