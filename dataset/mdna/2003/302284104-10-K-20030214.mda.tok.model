item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our primary source of revenue is fees we earn for providing our hr business process management services under long term contracts 
we also receive additional revenue from client projects and consulting services 
to date  we have generated leads for potential process management clients primarily through the company s management team  existing outsourcing and consulting relationships  our board of directors  third party consultants  contact with key executives at global corporations or direct communication from such companies in the form of inquiry or request for proposal 
after initial discussions with and qualification of the potential client  we may enter into a non disclosure agreement 
if subsequent discussions result in a mutual desire to pursue a transaction  we then may enter into a non binding letter of intent with the client that establishes a framework for due diligence and contract negotiations 
our letter of intent may provide for reimbursement of some or all of our direct and indirect costs incurred during this process 
we fulfill some of our service delivery obligations through the use of third party vendors  including vendors that had previously contracted directly with our clients and were then assigned  or are in the process of being assigned  to us in connection with our process management services 
we may continue to use these vendors  hire replacement vendors  or provide some of these services directly 
we are contractually responsible for the delivery and acceptability to our clients of these third party vendor services  and we include in revenue all charges for services for which we are contractually responsible  whether we provide these services directly using our own personnel or through third party vendors 
sometimes we pay the charges of the third party vendors that provide services and bill our clients for the cost of the service 
other times our client pays the third party vendor directly on our behalf 
in either case  such costs are included in our cost of revenue 
in many cases our initial cost of paying these vendors is equal to our revenue attributable to their services 
we intend to realize a profit from revenue received in connection with services provided under these third party vendor contracts  and in order to do so  we must reduce these vendor costs by rationalizing the vendors  improving efficiencies  obtaining more favorable pricing  or performing the services ourselves at a lower cost 
our business process management contracts are generally structured so that we receive a fee that is no greater than our client s historical cost of operating the functions assumed by us 
we typically agree to provide a minimum savings to the client on the labor based portion of the contract that we refer to as direct after about one year from contract signing  and we may be required to share further savings with our clients in negotiated gain sharing arrangements for the indirect spend portion of the contract covering services previously subcontracted by the client 
the amount of minimum savings is determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable contracts 
by operating client processes on a long term contract basis using our service platforms and methodologies  we seek to reduce the costs of service delivery below the minimum savings provided in the contract  and recover the investment we make during the early part of the contract term for transition and integration of client processes 
our process management service contracts generally have terms of to years  encompass multiple hr administrative processes  and require us to provide high levels of service at reduced costs to the client 
these contracts contain multiple responsibilities for us  including both our assumption of responsibility for transaction processing and administration  and transformation of the way hr work is performed over time by the client 
the transformation work we do is largely in addition to the work required to initiate and sustain service under the contract  and is ongoing for the life of the contract 
transformation activities include implementation and integration of new systems and tools  process change and standardization  consolidation of related activities  globalization of solutions across the client s business and geographic reach  rationalization of third party vendors to produce lower costs and better service and service metrics  establishment of an overall integrated service delivery model and the design and implementation of performance measurements  metrics and reports that support the client s goals 
the process management service contracts also identify specific deliverables associated with the multiple elements described above  in addition to numerous deliverables that are produced for the benefit of the client in the ordinary course under the contract that are not specifically identified in the contract 
while these deliverables generally can be completed by third parties  clients choose to obligate us to perform this work to obtain the benefit of our expertise  detailed knowledge and successful track record in implementing change in complex environments 
we incurred a net loss of million and million in and  respectively  and our net loss for was million 
while we reported profitable operations in the fourth quarter of and we expect to operate profitably in the future  we may incur net losses in future periods 
we anticipate ongoing significant expenditures to fund the development and expansion of our 
table of contents technology and general operating infrastructures 
we may also make substantial investments to pursue  obtain and transition new client contracts  to augment our service offering and process capabilities  to develop new service center capacity to accommodate any growth we may achieve beyond the capacity of our existing service center infrastructure  and to expand geographically to better serve our clients or compete more effectively 
to the extent that revenue does not increase at a rate commensurate with our increasing costs and expenditures  our future operating results and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to long term service contracts  bad debts  fixed assets and direct contract costs  intangible assets  income taxes  accruals in connection with certain business optimization costs  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we may revise these estimates and judgments from time to time as a result of changes in assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
long term contracts general 
we provide hr outsourcing services under multi year  multi element arrangements  which generally extend up to ten years 
these contracts are principally structured on a fee for service basis and provide that we receive a fee that is no greater than the client s historical cost of operating the functions assumed by us 
for some components of our outsourcing fees we provide negotiated discounts from the client s historical costs 
for other components of our outsourcing fees  principally reflecting amounts previously paid by clients to third party vendors  after we have recovered our costs and or achieved a negotiated minimum cost reduction  we may be required to share further savings with our clients in a negotiated gain sharing arrangement 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses based upon the proportion of costs incurred to the total expected costs for contracts that have reached operational stability 
we maintain for each of our contracts estimates of total revenue and cost over the respective contract term 
for purposes of periodic financial reporting  we accumulate total actual costs incurred to date under the contract 
the ratio of those actual costs to our then current estimate of total costs for the life of the contract is then applied to our then current estimate of total revenue for the life of the contract to determine the maximum portion of total estimated revenue that should be recognized 
we follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revisions in our contract estimates are reflected in the period in which the determination is made that facts and circumstances dictate a change of estimate 
favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue and profit recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and profit 
provisions for estimated losses on individual contracts are made in the period in which the loss first becomes apparent 
it has been our practice to limit the amount of revenue recognized as described above to the amounts that have been or can be currently billed as of the end of the reporting period under the terms of the contracts 
this limitation was implemented earlier in our history to minimize the potential impact of changes in estimates  which were more likely to be significant before we had achieved operational maturity in our business and operational stability in our underlying contracts 
now that our business has matured  our practice is to apply the revenue limitation on a contract by contract basis only until each contract reaches operational stability  and then to adjust the cumulative revenue recognized to date for that contract to fully reflect the then current estimates of profitability for the contract over its term 
we measure the achievement of operational stability for each contract by considering various factors  including completion of initial transition of client processes to our service delivery infrastructure  completion of the initial software and systems integration necessary to support our performance of services to the client  and achievement of stable operations under the contract as evidenced by the predictability of costs incurred 
in addition  there may be other factors relevant to the operational stability of any particular contract  which we consider as appropriate in determining whether to cease to apply the revenue limitation to that contract 
to the extent that revenue is recognized under this policy in excess of amounts billed under the contract  unbilled receivables will be recorded 
the revenue and gross profit adjustment on a contract resulting from discontinuance of the revenue limitation may be significant  depending on factors including the size of the contract and the cumulative costs incurred as of the date at which the contract achieved operational stability  but should not be considered indicative of future period results 
estimates and changes in estimates 
our method of accounting is intended to reflect the economic substance of our long term outsourcing contracts 
however  several factors can cause variability of reported results 

table of contents we make estimates of total contract revenue and cost  and we periodically update those estimates to reflect our evolving best estimates of the life of contract economics 
while we believe we can make reasonably dependable estimates  all estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to change 
incorrect assumptions or erroneous perceptions of the resources required or revenue potential of a contract may need to be corrected 
changes in circumstances may require modification of estimates that were appropriate when made 
uncertainties inherent in the performance of contracts may affect our assessment of our contracts over time 
in an effort to maintain appropriate estimates  our policy is to review each of our long term  fixed price outsourcing contracts on a regular basis  not less than annually  and to revise our estimates of revenue and cost as appropriate 
various factors could cause us to increase our estimates of contract expense 
for example  our employment expenses and fees paid to vendors will tend to increase over time and may increase significantly from time to time depending upon market conditions and other factors 
changes in technology or competition may require us to increase infrastructure spending to maintain appropriate service capabilities 
changes in law may increase compliance costs 
our cost estimates may include the effect of some anticipated future cost savings  in addition to savings already achieved  and anticipated future cost savings may not be realized 
other factors could cause us to decrease our estimates of contract expense 
for example  improvements in service delivery that we achieve through process engineering  application of technology  and vendor rationalization all tend to decrease contract costs 
in addition  various factors could cause us to reduce our estimates of contract revenue 
for example  clients may reduce contract scope  either by canceling processes due to performance issues or  under some circumstances  by in sourcing processes  subject to the terms of the contract with the client 
service volumes may decrease due to contraction of the client organization 
other factors could cause us to increase our estimates of contract revenue 
for example  service volumes may increase due to growth in the client s business  and clients may increase the scope of services they acquire from us through contract amendment 
increases in cost estimates and decreases in revenue estimates can have material adverse effects on our earnings 
if we determine that our previous cost estimates for a contract were too low  or our previous revenue estimates were too high  we will change our estimates appropriately in the period in which the determination is made  including the recognition of the cumulative impact of the revision 
the amount by which prior period revenue and gross profit was higher than it would have been if the updated estimates had been applied during earlier periods will be a revenue and gross profit reduction in the period that the estimates are changed  and the lower estimated contract margin will also reduce our future gross profit outlook 
conversely  if we determine that our previous cost estimates for a contract were too high  or our previous revenue estimates were too low  the amount by which prior period revenue and gross profit was lower than it would have been if the updated estimates had been applied during earlier periods will be a revenue and gross profit increase in the period that the estimates are changed subject to our revenue recognition limitation if it is then still in place for that particular contract  and the higher estimated contract margin will also increase our future gross profit outlook 
the magnitude of these effects will increase proportionately with the size of the contract and the extent of the change in estimates 
some of these effects could be significant 
further  because we have a relatively small number of contracts and high client concentration  adverse changes in estimates for a single client contract could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we do not enter into contracts that are expected to result in a loss  but from time to time increases in cost estimates or reductions in revenue estimates may result in projected negative margins on a contract 
in that case  the expected life of contract loss would be reflected as a cost in the period in which the loss determination was made  and the contract would then be accounted for at a zero margin going forward 
this could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the loss determination is made and would reduce our gross profit outlook 
policies and practices 
we apply various policies and practices  including principally the three described below  to guide our estimates of contract revenue and cost and to produce financial statements that we believe appropriately reflect the economic substance of our outsourcing business 
over time we may modify our policies and practices and implement new ones 
revenue limitation until operational stability 
as described above  we limit revenue recognized for each contract to amounts billed or billable until the contract reaches operational stability 
therefore  client contracts can contribute negative margins until operational stability is achieved 
in the quarter in which contract operational stability is achieved  there generally is a change of estimate for the contract resulting in a one time recognition of cumulative additional revenue and income attributable to the application of estimated life of contract margin to costs incurred in prior periods 
this change of estimate typically increases unbilled receivables and has a positive effect on our revenue and operating results for the period in which it occurs  but should not be considered to be an appropriate indication of future results 

table of contents revenue recognition for variable services 
some services included in our process management contracts  such as staffing and learning  can have high variability in service volumes because client spending in these areas is discretionary to a significant degree  and highly sensitive to changes in client policies and strategies  as well as economic conditions and developments in the client s business and outlook 
clients may choose to reduce or avoid such expenditures  which reduces our service volumes and revenue 
further  our costs for these resources can change quickly depending upon changing conditions in geographic or industry markets 
accordingly  our financial results from provision of these services are more variable than for other services such as payroll 
because of this variability  we do not believe we can make reasonably dependable estimates in these areas  so revenue and cost for these services are not included in contract estimates 
limited horizon for estimates 
we intend to achieve cost savings over the life of our outsourcing contracts 
however  the achievement of such savings becomes more speculative in the later years due to increasing delivery costs  uncertainty regarding client needs  and other factors 
therefore  contract estimates generally will reflect only those reductions in our costs of service delivery that we expect to realize within a limited time following the date of analysis 
short term arrangements in addition to our outsourcing contracts that extend over long periods of time  we provide our customers services on a short term basis 
these include consulting services primarily to non outsourcing clients  which services are generally structured on a per diem basis  and project based services for our outsourcing clients  which services may be structured on a per diem or fee for service basis 
for these short term arrangements  we recognize revenue as services are performed provided there is evidence of an arrangement  we have met our delivery obligation  the fee is deemed fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from inability of our clients to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
direct contract costs we capitalize certain set up and other direct installation costs direct contract costs to the extent that management determines such costs are recoverable 
capitalized set up and other direct installation costs are included in fixed assets and direct contract costs and are amortized over the applicable contract term 
as of december   we had direct contract costs of million  net of accumulated amortization  the majority of which were incurred during deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had million of net deferred tax assets  arising primarily from our net operating losses  for which we have fully reserved through the valuation allowance 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance and we continue to monitor our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
as we begin to demonstrate consistent profitability  an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance will be recorded which will increase income in the period that we determine it is more likely than not that we can recover all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 

table of contents results of operations our primary activities during and were organization  planning and certain work performed for our first business process management client prior to entering into the related long term contract 
we did not generate any outsourcing process revenues from long term contracts prior to at december   we had approximately employees 
as of december   we had five business process management clients and approximately employees 
as of december  and  we had six business process management clients and approximately  employees and  employees  respectively 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results  including our revenue  gross profit loss and expenses as a percentage of revenue  should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the years indicated for the year ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit loss expenses selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization warrant charges total expenses loss from operations investment and interest income  net net loss exclusive of depreciation and amortization 
includes million of business optimization costs in excluding such costs  selling  general and administrative expense was as a percentage of revenue 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
the amount included million  or  of revenue derived from five business process management clients  and the amount included million  or  of revenue derived from seven business process management clients one of which is no longer a client 
the balance of our and revenue primarily consisted of consulting revenue generated from various clients 
the revenue increase for the period as compared to the period principally resulted from the progressive transition of service responsibility to us under five process management contracts that were executed at various dates from december through november  together with two scope expansion amendments for an existing client that were executed during plus the addition of two new process management clients in october and january in addition  as a result of the maturation of its business  the company determined during the third quarter of that it was no longer necessary to limit revenue recognition to amounts billed once a contract has reached operational stability 
this resulted in a change in estimate for our contracts and recognition of million of additional outsourcing revenue and operating income for the year ended december  for those contracts 
a portion of this amount would previously have been recognized as revenue under those contracts if revenue for prior periods had not been limited to amounts billed  and a portion of this amount would not have been recognized until billed in future periods if revenue had continued to be limited to amounts billed under those contracts 
as of december   all of our long term outsourcing contracts had reached operational stability 
for the year ended december   two process management clients accounted for and  respectively  of revenue as compared to three process management clients accounting for  and  respectively  of revenue for the year ended december  no other client accounted for more than of revenue in the and periods 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our process management revenue was generated from the provision of services with more highly variable volumes  such as staffing and learning  which depend upon client discretionary spending 
as described above  revenue from these services is excluded from our contract estimates 

table of contents transition of our existing base of business is substantially complete  so revenue growth in and future periods will depend primarily upon our ability to obtain new clients and sell additional services to existing clients 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively  and our gross margin loss for the same periods was and  respectively  as a percentage of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of compensation and benefits paid to our employees who are directly involved in providing our services  computer and communications equipment and services costs  facilities costs and expenses associated with third party vendors who provide services on our behalf for our clients within the scope of our process management contracts 
the increase in the cost of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  principally resulted from the progressive transition of service responsibility to exult under our various process management contracts and the continuing expansion of our infrastructure and service capacity 
the improvement in our gross margin in the period as compared to the period reflects the increased leverage achieved through higher utilization of our client service centers and other service delivery systems combined with the impact of continuing cost controls and efficiency programs instituted in connection with our exult service delivery model 
operating expense will tend to increase to support any growth we may achieve  and our profitability depends upon our ability to scale our business by leveraging existing resources across a broader revenue base and limiting increases in operating expense associated with new business to levels significantly below our clients historical costs of operating the processes we assume 
significant expansion of capacity in connection with new contracts may delay our achievement of this scale 
we have incurred  and may incur in the future  negative gross margins as we continue to transition and transform our clients hr processes 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense for the years ended december  and  was million  or as a percentage of revenue  and million  or as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expense generally consists of compensation for employees engaged in developing product features and service delivery capabilities  marketing  promoting and selling our services  and management and administrative activities 
selling  general and administrative expense also includes third party consulting and marketing expenditures  as well as facilities and office costs  and legal  accounting and recruiting fees and expenses 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expense may include business optimization costs that are incurred during the period 
we call these charges business optimization costs because they reflect our pursuit of strategies intended to enhance our efficiency and profitability as our operating scale increases and our business progresses toward operational maturity 
we may incur business optimization costs from time to time as we implement new organization structures  technologies  processes and other changes in our business 
for the year ended december   there were no business optimization costs incurred 
however  for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expense included business optimization costs totaling million  consisting of severance charges of million  certain wind up costs resulting in a million charge associated with the elimination of a secondary  non strategic processing center  and a million non cash charge arising from the write off of a research database that we have determined is no longer a strategic component of our business 
the cash portion of these charges totaled million 
the company had made cash payments totaling million through december   and reduced the initial accrual  and accordingly selling  general and administrative expense  by million during the year ended december   as a result of completion of certain of these arrangements at amounts less than previously estimated and changes in estimates with regard to the remaining arrangements 
exclusive of business optimization costs  selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or as a percentage of revenue 
exclusive of business optimization costs  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily resulted from increased severance and compensation expense  and the decrease in the expense as a percentage of revenue resulted from the rate of revenue growth experienced in the period 
further improvement in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenue depends upon revenue growth and leveraging existing infrastructure over a broader revenue base 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and  was million  or as a percentage of revenue  and million  or as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
included in the and periods was million and million  respectively  of depreciation and amortization expense principally from fixed assets 
also included in the and periods was intangible asset and other amortization of million and million  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from fixed assets and direct contract costs reflects the continuing build out of our infrastructure and service delivery capabilities 
with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the company ceased amortization of goodwill 
if sfas no 
had been adopted as of january   intangible asset and other amortization expense for the year ended december   would have been million 
investment and interest income  net 
investment and interest income  net for the years ended december  and consisted of investment and interest income of million and million  respectively  partially offset by interest expense of million and million  respectively 
investment and interest income is generated primarily from short term investing of cash in 
table of contents excess of current requirements 
while the company generally had greater available cash balances during the period as compared to the period  investment and interest income  net in the period decreased as compared to the period principally as a result of lower interest rates in the period 
interest expense is associated with certain long term obligations in both periods and for the period debt incurred to purchase the gunn partners  inc assets in november income taxes 
we have incurred losses since our founding in  resulting in federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in and  respectively 
the foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the tax benefit generated by the net operating losses because of the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets 
net loss 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss for the years ended december  and  of million  or per basic and diluted share  and million  or per basic and diluted share  respectively 
we may incur net losses in subsequent periods 
years ended december  and revenue 
revenue for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively 
the amount included million  or  of revenue derived from five business process management clients  and the amount included million  or  of revenue derived from four business process management clients 
the balance of our and revenue primarily consisted of consulting revenue generated from various clients 
the revenue increase for as compared to principally resulted from the progressive transition of service responsibility to exult under five process management contracts which were executed at various dates from december through november the contract for the company s sixth process management client was executed in october  with process transition occurring in january  so this contract did not result in any revenue in for the years ended december  and  one process management client accounted for and  respectively  of revenue 
a second process management client accounted for of revenue in and generated no revenue in no other client accounted for more than of revenue in and for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of our process management revenue was generated from the provision of optional services  which revenue is excluded from our contract estimates 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue for the years ended december  and  was million and million  respectively  and our gross margin loss for the same periods was and  respectively  as a percentage of revenue 
the increase in the cost of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  principally resulted from the progressive transition of service responsibility to exult under our various process management contracts and the continuing expansion of our infrastructure and service capacity 
we began to operate our first primary client service center during the first six months of  opened a second in the latter half of  and began operating our third primary client service center during the first quarter of we did not begin operating our fourth primary center until the first quarter of  so results do not include any costs associated with operating that center 
the improvement in our gross margin in the period as compared to the period reflects the increased leverage achieved through higher utilization of our client service centers and other service delivery systems combined with the impact of continuing cost controls and efficiency programs instituted in connection with our exult service delivery model 
selling  general and administrative expense 
for the years ended december  and  selling  general and administrative expense was million  or as a percentage of revenue  and million  or as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
as previously discussed  also included in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  were business optimization costs totaling million 
exclusive of business optimization costs  selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million  or as a percentage of revenue 
exclusive of business optimization costs  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily resulted from the redeployment of certain personnel and other resources to direct client activities  at which time the costs associated with such employees were included in cost of revenue 
the decrease in percentage of revenue for as compared to primarily resulted from the revenue growth experienced in as compared to depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and was million  or as a percentage of revenue  and million  or as a percentage of revenue  respectively 
included in the and periods was million and million  respectively  of depreciation and amortization expense principally from fixed assets 
also included in the and periods was intangible asset and other amortization of million 
table of contents and million  respectively 
the increase in depreciation and amortization from fixed assets and direct contract costs reflects the continuing build out of our infrastructure and service delivery capabilities 
warrant charges 
warrant charges were million for the year ended december   and consists of a charge for warrants issued in connection with the sale of common stock 
in  no warrant charges were incurred 
investment and interest income  net 
investment and interest income  net for years ended december  and consisted of investment and interest income of million and million  respectively  partially offset by interest expense of million and million  respectively 
investment and interest income is generated primarily from short term investing of cash in excess of current requirements 
while the company generally had greater available cash balances during the period as compared to the period  investment and interest income  net in the period decreased as compared to the period principally as a result of lower interest rates in the period 
interest expense is associated with certain long term obligations and the debt incurred to purchase the gunn partners  inc assets in november income taxes 
we incurred losses since our founding in  resulting in federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning in and  respectively 
the foreign net operating loss may be carried forward indefinitely 
a full valuation allowance has been provided against the tax benefit generated by the net operating losses because of the uncertainty of realizing the deferred tax assets 
net loss 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss for the years ended december  and of million  or per basic and diluted share  and million  or per basic and diluted share  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in october through december   we have financed our operations primarily with equity contributions  including net cash received from private placement sales of our capital stock totaling million from inception  the net proceeds from our june initial public offering and the august follow on public offering totaling million  and  to a lesser extent  by cash generated from our business and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
we obtained our first three process management contracts in december and january and began generating revenue from these contracts during the first quarter of we obtained two additional process management contracts during the second half of and began generating revenue from both of these agreements by the first quarter of we obtained our sixth and seventh process management contracts in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively  and began generating revenue from these agreements during the first half of we opened our first two primary service centers during  our third primary client service center during the first quarter and the fourth primary center during the first quarter 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  reflecting the growth in our operations  including expanded working capital needs and funding certain transition and transformation costs associated with the process management contracts partially offset by an increasing efficiency in our service delivery model over the three year period 
we also used cash to pursue additional business opportunities and the development of our corporate infrastructure 
cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities in the period as compared to the period arises primarily from investments of the company s available cash 
during the period and almost the entire period  the company maintained substantially all of its available cash in money market accounts and certificates of deposit with maturities of days or less 
these investments are included in cash and cash equivalents 
commencing in december and continuing throughout  in order to enhance its investment yield  the company began to invest a portion of its available cash in financial instruments with maturity dates in excess of days 
these financial instruments consist primarily of us government debt securities and high grade investment quality debt securities with maturities of less than three years 
accordingly  the transactions in such securities are included in investing activities in the and periods and represent net cash used in investing activities of million and million  respectively 
the balance of cash used in investing activities for the  and periods of million  million and million  respectively  was used primarily to construct and expand our client service centers and our internal systems during all three periods and  in addition during the period  to make certain payments with respect to new client contracts and to fund certain client set up costs 
we generated million  million and million in cash  net from financing activities during the years ended december   and  respectively  primarily from the june and august public offerings of our common stock as well as private placements of our preferred and common stock in the and periods and primarily from the exercise of stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan in the period 

table of contents we may generate negative cash flow from operations in the future 
we also expect to continue our investments in fixed assets and direct contract costs to support the expansion and renovation of our facilities  including our existing client service centers  to make certain payments with regard to new client acquisitions  and to purchase related computer and other equipment necessary to support our client contracts and growth 
in addition  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate potential acquisitions of related businesses  assets  services and technologies 
such acquisitions  if completed  may require significant cash expenditures 
as of december   we had cash and marketable securities of million  which was roughly equivalent to the balance at the end of the second quarter of and million greater that the balance at the end of the third quarter of cash consumption in the third and fourth quarters benefited from favorable changes in working capital components which may not be sustainable 
cash consumption therefore may increase in the first quarter of however  we believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
if we experience rapid growth or unanticipated expenses  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings in order to maintain adequate cash balances to satisfy the expectations of prospective clients  finance acquisitions  new client contracts with capital investment requirements  and other strategic opportunities  and address operating issues 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms  or at all  and if we need additional funds but cannot obtain them  our ability to fund our operations or strategic initiatives may be impaired 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company has the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments for the periods indicated in thousands january  through december  january  through december  thereafter total long term obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations certain of the agreements provide the company with the ability to cancel the respective agreement for convenience upon the payment of a fee

table of contents in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf issue relates to the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for such costs only when the liability is incurred 
in contrast  under eitf issue  a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it commited to an exit plan 
the fasb concluded in sfas no 
that an entity s commitment to an exit plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
statement no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  addresses the accounting  by a vendor  for contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue generating activities will be performed by the vendor 
in some situations  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of fair values to account separately for the different deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other situations  some or all of the different deliverables are interrelated closely or there is not sufficient evidence of fair value to account separately for the different deliverables 
eitf issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the company has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of eitf issue on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity at december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities totaling million 
the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position
