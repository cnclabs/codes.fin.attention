item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under certain factors that may affect our future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we provide software and related services that allow our clients to more effectively manage their business to business relationships through the entirety of the contract management lifecycle 
our products and services were originally developed to manage complex contract purchasing relationships in the healthcare industry 
our software is currently licensed by of the largest and of the largest pharmaceutical manufacturers  ranked according to annual healthcare revenues 
we have also expanded our products and services to new vertical markets  particularly the consumer packaged goods and foodservice industries  and to procurement side contracting 
our acquisitions of chi cor information management  inc chicor in november has provided us with accepted products  customers and expertise in the consumer products and foodservice vertical markets 
also  our acquisitions of bcl vision ltd 
bcl renamed i many international limited in april  netreturn llc 
table of contents netreturn in march and menerva technologies  inc menerva in march have expanded our portfolio of software solutions  which we market to customers within our currently targeted and other vertical markets 
the acquired companies revenues and results of operations have been included together with those of the company from the actual dates of the acquisitions 
as a result  any period to period comparisons of the company s historical results of operations are affected by the timing of these acquisitions 
in the first quarter of  we introduced i many contractsphere  which provides a wide range of contract management capabilities with both buy and sell side contract management functions  from contract planning  negotiation and creation to accurate and timely transaction compliance  settlement and analytics 
we envision that all contracts in an enterprise will eventually be seamlessly managed by a single  integrated enterprise contract management solution utilizing a central contract repository and uniform contract business process to provide companies with consistent and accurate access to the value of its contracts  which are otherwise often locked in filing cabinets 
we have generated revenues from both products and services 
product revenues which through mid had been principally comprised of software license fees generated from our i many cars software suite and now includes licensing of contractsphere software solutions  collections and disputes management  government pricing and medicaid compliance software and deductions and trade promotions accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in service revenues include maintenance and support fees directly related to our licensed software products  professional service fees derived from consulting  installation  business analysis and training services related to our software products and hosting fees 
service revenues accounted for of net revenues in and of net revenues in after being profitable in  we increased our spending significantly during and the first half of  principally to increase the size of our sales and marketing workforce and for development and marketing expenses related to the development of our web based initiatives 
our operating expenses excluding acquisition related amortization and write offs  restructuring charges and charges related to minority equity investments have increased significantly since  from million for the months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  these increases are primarily due to additions to our staff  including through acquisitions  as we have expanded all aspects of our operations 
we have grown from employees as of december  to employees at december  in the first two months of  we have taken actions to reduce our operating expenses in order to better align our cost structure with our projected revenues 
these actions include selective headcount reductions and the closing of our chicago  illinois office 
as of march   our total headcount was employees 
critical accounting policies we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
software license revenues are attributable to the addition of new customers  and the expansion of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products and license renewals 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition as amended by sop  software revenue recognition  with respect 
table of contents to certain arrangements 
we recognize software license fees upon execution of a signed license agreement and delivery of the software to customers  provided there are no significant post delivery obligations  the payment is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in multiple element arrangements  we allocate the total fee to professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the fair value of those elements  which is defined as the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
the residual amount is then allocated to the software license fee 
in cases where significant post delivery obligations exist  such as customization or enhancements to the core software  we recognize the license fee on a percentage of completion basis 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where collection is not deemed probable due to lack of credible evidence of customer s creditworthiness  we recognize the license fee as payments are received 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
professional service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if conditions for acceptance exist  professional service revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
for fixed fee professional service contracts  we provide for anticipated losses in the period in which the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  losses incurred on fixed fee contracts have not been significant 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
included in training revenues are registration fees received from participants in our off site user training conferences 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is generally twelve months 
when maintenance and support is included in the total license fee  we allocate a portion of the total fee to maintenance and support based upon the price paid by the customer to purchase maintenance and support in the second year 
payments received from customers at the inception of a maintenance period are treated as deferred service revenues and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
payments received from customers in advance of product shipment or revenue recognition are treated as deferred product revenues and recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or when otherwise earned 
substantially all of the amounts included in cost of revenues represent direct costs related to the delivery of professional services  training and maintenance and customer support 
to date  cost of product revenues have not been significant 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill will be tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 

table of contents identified intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the fair value of the identified intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that difference 
identified intangible assets with indefinite useful lives will not be amortized until their lives are determined to be definite 
we account for consideration given to a customer or a reseller of our products as a reduction of revenue in certain circumstances 
to the extent that consideration earned by a customer or reseller during a reporting period exceeds revenue earned by the company from the customer or reseller  such excess is reported as sales and marketing expense 
we record provisions for doubtful accounts based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivables  our historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of customers and the economic conditions of the customers industries and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of the company s future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
the provisions for doubtful accounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
due to the uncertainty regarding our ability to realize our net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  a full valuation allowance has been placed against the otherwise recognizable net deferred tax asset 
recent events in the quarter ended december   we recorded a million charge in connection with the impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to our acquisitions of intersoft international  inc intersoft and provato  inc provato and to our purchase of technology from ozro  inc ozro 
in february  our strategic relationship agreement with procter gamble p g was amended to delete a royalty provision  in exchange for which we granted to p g a fully exercisable warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share 
under the terms of the original agreement  we had agreed to pay a royalty of up to of certain revenues  but no such royalties had yet been paid 
we will record the calculated fair value of the warrant  in the first quarter of as a component of sales and marketing expense 
in february  the company made the decision to close its chicago office as part of its efforts to reduce operating expenses and consolidate its operations 
the company expects to incur an initial charge of approximately million in the first quarter of related to the chicago office closing 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues increased by  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the same period last year 
this increase resulted primarily from the introduction and sales of new products derived from technology and companies acquired during and licensed to existing and new customers 
also  the average size of new license agreements minimum value of  increased while the number of license contracts sold decreased from in to during the year ended december  an aggregate of of our product revenues in came from existing customers  for the purchase of additional modules  new user licenses  and license renewals

as a percentage of total net revenues  product revenues increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  service revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in this reduction principally reflects a decrease in maintenance and support fees that is attributable to lower license fees charged on license renewals  maintenance and support fees being typically determined as a percentage of the related license fee  and a decrease in revenues derived from professional service engagements 
the reduction in professional service revenues is attributable to one unusually large consulting engagement  which generated significant revenues beginning in this project began tapering off in late and was completed during cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of payroll and related costs and subcontractor costs for providing professional services and maintenance and support services and  to a lesser extent  amounts due to third parties for royalties related to integrated technology 
historically  cost of product revenues has not been a significant component of total cost of revenues 
cost of revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to the reduction in subcontractor consulting costs from million for the year ended december  to  in the same period in also  travel expenses decreased by  in as compared to as a percentage of total net revenues  cost of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is attributable to the decrease in subcontractor costs discussed above and to the increase in product revenues as a percent of total 
table of contents revenues 
product revenues have typically generated higher margins than service revenues  and we believe that trend will continue in the foreseeable future 
operating expenses sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions for sales personnel  travel costs  recruiting fees  expenses for trade shows and advertising and public relations expenses 
also  sales and marketing expenses included a one time  non cash charge of  in the quarter ended june  related to the value associated with the granting of a common stock warrant to accenture 
excluding the accenture warrant charge  sales and marketing expense increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily the result of a million increase in sales force salary  commission and fringe benefit costs  partially offset by a million reduction in spending for advertising  marketing and promotional activities 
as a percentage of total net revenues  sales and marketing expense excluding the non cash warrant charge increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  for the first quarter of  sales and marketing expense will include a non cash charge of  associated with the grant to p g of a warrant  in exchange for the deletion of the royalty provision in our strategic relationship agreement 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs for development personnel and external consulting costs associated with the development and maintenance of our products 
research and development costs  including the costs of developing computer software  are charged to operations as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase in research and development expenses is principally attributable to higher salary and fringe benefit costs  most of which is the direct result of engineers hired pursuant to our recent acquisitions of netreturn and menerva and  to a lesser extent  our establishment of an advanced technology center 
as a percentage of total net revenues  research and development expense increased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  general and administrative

general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is principally attributable to reductions in salary and benefit costs  of which  represents the year to year reduction in non cash stock compensation to our chief executive officer 
also  decreases in legal fees and travel expenses were offset by higher insurance costs and additions to the provision for bad debts 
as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  depreciation 
from march to june  depreciation included amortization of capitalized internal use software development costs related to the company s internet portal 

table of contents excluding amortization related to the internet portal  the value of which was written off during the third quarter of  depreciation expense increased by  or  from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december  this increase is a result of additions of computer hardware and software related to infrastructure expenditures 
amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
the company did not record any amortization of goodwill during the year ended december  as a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on january  amortization expense totaling million in the year ended december  represents the amortization of other purchased intangibles with determinable useful lives 
excluding the effect of the amortization of goodwill that was recognized during  amortization expense increased by million  or  from million in the year ended december  this increase in amortization of other purchased intangible assets is attributable to the consummation of additional acquisitions during the third quarter of and first quarter of amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  amounted to million 
in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of menerva in march  we allocated million of the total purchase price to in process research and development  which was expensed upon consummation of the acquisition 
this allocation was based on an independent appraisal conducted for the purpose of allocating the initial consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
this allocation was attributable to one in process research and development project  which consisted of the development of significant new features and functionality to an existing software product 
menerva had achieved significant technological milestones on the project as of the acquisition date  but the project had not reached technological feasibility 
at the time of the acquisition  the project was approximately complete 
the company invested an additional  in the project following acquisition 
the project s development  which progressed in all material respects consistently with the assumptions that the company had used for estimating its fair value  was subsequently completed in may in connection with the acquisition of provato  inc in august and bcl in april  we allocated million and million  respectively  of the purchase price to in process research and development  all of which were immediately expensed as their projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
these allocations were based on independent appraisals conducted for the purpose of allocating the initial consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the respective acquisitions 
impairment of intangibles 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that an interim test for impairment to the company s goodwill and other acquired intangible assets was necessary as a result of the continuing negative business climate for software companies 
further  as a result of the company s efforts to align its strategies to the expected software marketplace  the company determined that certain long lived assets would not be employed to generate future cash flow 
as a result of its assessment  the company recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  associated with its acquisitions of provato and intersoft and its november technology purchase from ozro  inc ozro 
the impairment charge related to intersoft was recorded in the consumer packaged goods food services reportable segment 
the impairment charges related to provato and ozro were not included in a reportable segment 
in the cases of provato and ozro  the values of goodwill and other intangibles were fully written off based upon the company s determination that it was no longer likely to use the technologies it acquired  and consequently  the fair value of these assets became nominal 
with respect to intersoft  the company determined that the fair value of the intersoft operation was negatively impacted by the operation s continued inability to generate positive cashflows 
accordingly  the full remaining value of intersoft s goodwill and other purchased intangibles was written off 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of  related to the carrying value of intersoft s goodwill 
restructuring and other charges 
in the quarter ended september   we recorded as an other charge  representing a write off of the net carrying value of our investment in tibersoft corporation  a privately held technology company tibersoft

table of contents as a percentage of total net revenues  cost of revenues decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  this decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of total net revenues is attributable to the smaller level of service revenues as a percent of total revenues service revenues typically generate lower margins than product revenues and the decrease in subcontractor costs

table of contents we are currently engaged in discussions with one of our customers regarding payment of a receivable 
the customer has alleged that we did not adequately perform the requested services and has refused further payment 
in addition  the customer is seeking return of the amounts paid by it to date  totaling approximately million 
we believe that the company is entitled to all payments due to it under the contract with the customer and intend to pursue payment aggressively 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  acquisitions  the timing of expanded product and service offerings and the success of these offerings once they are launched 
accordingly  any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our current balance of cash and cash equivalents is insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity needs  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise funds  and those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
in connection with such a sale of stock  our stockholders may experience dilution 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
contractual obligations payments due by period amounts in s total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations certain factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this annual report on form k  the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time 
we have incurred substantial losses in recent years and our return to profitability is uncertain we incurred net losses of million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december   and we had an accumulated deficit at december  of million 
in these periods 
table of contents of net losses  our expenses exceeded our revenues generally due to increases in research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  and non cash expenses related to acquisitions 
we expect to continue spending significantly  principally for sales  marketing and development expenses  and therefore we will need to grow our revenues significantly before we reach profitability 
in addition  our recent results have been impacted by a number of factors that caused current and prospective customers to defer  or otherwise not make  purchases from us  and we cannot assure you that we will not be affected by these factors in future periods 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve sufficient revenues to become profitable in the future it is difficult for us to predict when or if sales will occur and we often incur significant selling expenses in advance of our recognition of any related revenue our clients view the purchase of our software applications and related professional services as a significant and strategic decision 
as a result  clients carefully evaluate our software products and services 
the length of this evaluation process is affected by factors such as the client s need to rapidly implement a solution and whether the client is new or is extending an existing implementation 
the license of our software products may also be subject to delays if the client has lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes which are quite common in the context of introducing large enterprise wide technology solutions  particularly during this economic downturn 
we may incur significant selling and marketing expenses during a client s evaluation period  including the costs of developing a full proposal and completing a rapid proof of concept or demonstration  before the client places an order with us 
clients may also initially purchase a limited number of licenses before expanding their implementations 
larger clients may purchase our software products as part of multiple simultaneous purchasing decisions  which may result in additional unplanned administrative processing and other delays in the recognition of our license revenues 
if revenues forecasted from a significant client for a particular quarter are not realized or are delayed  as has occurred in recent quarters  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in revenues during that quarter 
this may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the value of our common stock to decline 
current economic conditions may continue to weaken our sales the current downturn and uncertainty in general economic and market conditions have negatively affected and will likely continue to negatively affect demand for our products and services 
if the current economic downturn continues or worsens  our business  financial condition and results of operations will continue to be harmed 
in addition  current world economic and political conditions have reduced the willingness of our customers and prospective customers to commit funds to purchase our products and services 
the resulting loss or delay in our sales has had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have two management locations and other facilities  and as we continue to grow we may experience difficulties in operating from these facilities certain members of our management team are based at our offices located in portland  maine  and other members of our management team are based at our corporate headquarters in edison  new jersey 
in addition  as a result of acquisitions  we have additional offices in 
table of contents stratford  connecticut  redwood city  california and london  united kingdom  and we are opening a software development office in india 
the geographic distance between these offices could make it difficult for our management and other employees to effectively communicate with each other and  as a result  could place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
we are highly dependent upon the healthcare industry  and factors that adversely affect that market could also adversely affect us most of our revenue to date has come from pharmaceutical companies and other clients in the healthcare industry  and our future growth depends  in large part  upon increased sales to the healthcare market 
as a result  demand for our solutions could be affected by any factors that could adversely affect the demand for healthcare products  which are purchased and sold pursuant to contracts managed through our solutions 
the healthcare market is undergoing intense consolidation 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience declines in revenue caused by mergers or consolidations among our clients and potential clients 
our efforts to target markets other than the healthcare market may divert resources and management attention away from our core competencies in connection with our efforts to expand into other markets  it has been necessary for us to hire additional personnel with expertise in these other industries  and we have also diverted funds  talent  management attention and other resources toward markets that have not traditionally been the primary source of our revenues 
the risks of such diversification include the possibility that we will not be successful in generating the revenue we expect from these markets and the possible detrimental effect of diverting resources from our traditional markets 
we may not be successful in acquiring new technologies or businesses and this could hinder our expansion efforts we intend in the future to consider additional acquisitions of or new investments in complementary businesses  products  services or technologies 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition or investment candidates 
even if we do identify suitable candidates  we cannot assure you that we will be able to make such acquisitions or investments on commercially acceptable terms 
furthermore  we may incur debt  reduce our cash position or issue equity securities with respect to any future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities could be dilutive to our existing stockholders and the issuance of debt could limit our available cash and accordingly restrict our activities 
we may make additional acquisitions and we may have difficulty integrating them we have acquired chicor  intersoft  bcl vision ltd 
now i many international limited  provato  netreturn and menerva  each of which is or was located in cities very distant from our management locations in edison  new jersey and portland  maine 
we may make additional acquisitions 
any company that we acquire is likely to be distant from our headquarters in edison  new jersey and will have a culture different from ours as well as technologies  products and services that our employees will need to understand and integrate with our own 
we are continuing to assimilate the employees  technologies and products of the 
table of contents companies that we have acquired and will need to do the same with any new companies we may acquire  and that effort has been  and will likely continue to be difficult  time consuming and may be unsuccessful 
if we are not successful  our investment in the acquired entity may be impaired or lost  and even if we are successful  the process of integrating an acquired entity may divert our attention from our core business 
if we do acquire new technologies or businesses  our results of operations may be adversely affected in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded substantial goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
in addition  we recorded charges for write offs of a portion of the purchase prices of acquired companies as in process research and development 
although the amortization of goodwill has been discontinued pursuant to the recent issuance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of any intangible assets will need to be reviewed for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded a million impairment charge in connection with the write off of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that future write downs of any such assets will not affect future operating results 
our fixed costs have led  and may continue to lead  to fluctuations in operating results which have resulted  and could in the future result  in a decline of our stock price a significant percentage of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and rent  are fixed costs and are based in part on expectations of future revenues 
we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner to compensate for any significant fluctuations in revenues 
accordingly  shortfalls in revenues  as we experienced in recent quarters  may cause significant variations in operating results in any quarter 
our stock price has been impacted by the failure of our quarterly results to meet the expectations of market analysts and investors  and there is no assurance that it will not decline further 
the bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has been below per share  and unless the bid price increases our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market which could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital 
since march   the closing bid price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has been below per share 
if the closing bid price of our common stock remains below for consecutive trading days  we would receive written notification from nasdaq that we are not in compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
after such notice  we would have a period of time to regain compliance 
to regain compliance  the bid price of our common stock must close at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive trading days 
if we do not regain compliance within the grace period established by nasdaq  we may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
the delisting of our common stock may result in the trading of the stock on the nasdaq smallcap or the otc bulletin board 
consequently  a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq national market may reduce the liquidity of our common stock  adversely affect our ability to raise additional necessary capital and could adversely affect our sales efforts 

table of contents we have many competitors and potential competitors and we may not be able to compete effectively the market for our products and services is competitive and subject to rapid change 
we encounter significant competition for the sale of our contract management software from the internal information systems departments of existing and potential clients  software companies that target the contract management markets  professional services organizations and internet based merchants offering healthcare and other products through online catalogs 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of products and services offered 
we anticipate increased competition for market share and pressure to reduce prices and make sales concessions  which could materially and adversely affect our revenues and margins 
many of our existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees and strategic partners 
we cannot assure you that our competitors will not develop products or services that are equal or superior to our solutions or that achieve greater market acceptance than our solutions 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not require us to make concessions that will adversely affect our revenues and our margins  or reduce the demand for our products and services 
we rely significantly upon certain key individuals and our business will suffer if we are unable to retain them we depend on the services of our senior management and key technical personnel 
in particular  our success depends on the continued efforts of a 
leigh powell  our chief executive officer  and other key employees 
the loss of the services of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
