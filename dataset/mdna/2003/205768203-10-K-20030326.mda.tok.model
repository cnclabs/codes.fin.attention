item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of previously issued financial statements subsequent to the issuance of our annual report for the year ended decembe r   we determined that certain outstanding advances made by us to our partner under our joint exploration venture in the gulf of mexico for seismic data acquisition should have been charged to exploration expense rather than reflected on the balance sheet as an asset 
as a result of changing our accounting treatment for the advances used for seismic data acquisition  we determined that our financial statements for   and should b e restated 
the effect of the restatement is a reduction to previously reported net income by million  million  million and million for the years   and  respectively  as a result of the additional exploration expense in each year 
these changes primarily affect the timing of our recognition of exploration expense 
as reimbursements are received for the advances we have made  our future exploration expense will be reduced 
in addition  we have reclassified our series preferred stock from stockholder s equity at december  to temporary equity 
the adjustments to previously reported net income relating to the restatement are summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands net income loss attributable to common stock as previously reported    adjustment to exploration expense income tax effect net income loss attributable to common stock as restated    the following balance sheet accounts as of december  were affected by the restatement year ended december previously reported restat ed in thousands unevaluated oil and gas properties   oil and gas properties   net property and equipment   total assets   accounts payable and accrued expenses   total current liabilities   deferred taxes payable   retained earnings   redeemable preferred stock  total stockholders equity   total liabilities and stockholders equity   the following presents the impact of the restatement on the operating results and cash flows for the years ended december  and year ended year ended december  dec ember  previously prev iously reported restated repor ted restated in thousands  except per share amounts exploration expense   total operating expenses   income from continuing operations before income taxes   income tax expense   net income from continuing operations   net income   net income attributable to common stock   net income per share from continuing operations basic diluted net income per share basic diluted net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used for investing activities   the following presents the impact related to the restatement on the quarterly results for the year ended december  three months ended march previously reported adjustment restated in thousands  except per share amounts exploration expense   total expenses   income from continuing operations before income taxes   income tax expense  net income from continuing operations  net income  net income attributable to common stock  net income per share from continuing operations basic diluted net income per share basic diluted three months ended june  previously reported adjustment r estated in thousands  except per share amounts exploration expense total expenses  income from continuing operations before income taxes  income tax expense  net income from continuing operations  net income  net income attributable to common stock  net income per share from continuing operations basic diluted net income per share basic diluted three months ended september previously reported adjustment restated in thousands  except per share amounts exploration expense total expenses  income from continuing operations before income taxes  income tax expense  net income from continuing operations  net income  net income attributable to common stock  net income per share from continuing operations basic diluted net income per share basic diluted previously reported amounts have been adjusted for the effects of discontinued operations

represents average equivalent price per mcfe less oil and gas operating expenses per mcfe and general and administrative expenses per mcfe 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our oil and gas sales decreased million or in to million from million in the decrease in sales is mostly due to the lower natural gas prices in our average natural gas price decreased by and our average oil price decreased by 
on an equivalent unit basis  our average price received for our production in was per mcfe  which was lower than our average price in of per mcfe 
our average natural gas price in was higher as a result of gains from hedging activities without the hedging gains  our natural gas price would have averaged in the lower prices were partially offset by an increase in production 
our natural gas production was up while our oil production fell by 
the natural gas production increase is related to our acquisition of devx energy  inc which we completed in december the oil production decrease was due t o normal depletion of our oil properties 
our oil and gas operating expenses  which includes production taxes  increased million or  to million in from million in the increase is due to the higher production level in our oil and gas operating expenses per equivalent mcf produced decreased by to in from for the decrease in per unit lifting costs is primaril y related to lower production taxes resulting from the lower oil and natural gas prices in in  we had million in exploration expense  which primarily related to the write off of four exploratory dry holes

in april and july  we sold certain oil and gas properties  which resulted in a loss of million 
the operating results of these properties have been reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements including the losses on disposal 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our oil and gas sales decreased million or in to million from million in the slight decrease in sales is due to a decrease in our oil and natural gas production in our oil production in decreased by and natural gas production increased by

liquidity and capital resources funding for our activities has historically been provided by our operating cash flow  debt or equity financings or asset dispositions 
in  our net cash flow provided by operating activities totaled million 
our other primary funding source in were proceeds from the sale of million of our senior notes and borrowings of million under our bank credit facility our primary needs for capital  in addition to funding our ongoing operations  relate to the acquisition  development and exploration of our oil and gas properties and the repayment of our debt 
in  we incurred capital expenditures of million for development and exploration activities and fo r the acquisitions 
we also repaid million of our long term debt 
our annual capital expenditure activity is summarized in the following table year ended december  in thousands acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties 
   acquisitions of unproved oil and gas properties    developmental leasehold costs  workovers and recompletions    offshore production facilities   development drilling    exploratory drilling    other  total    the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary because we have no material long term capital expenditure commitments 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of our capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
we spent million  million an d million on development and exploration activities in  and  respectively 
we have budgeted approximately million for development and exploration projects in we expect to use internally generated cash flow t o fund development and exploration activity 
our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices  especially natural gas prices 
we spent million  million and million on acquisition activities in  and  respectively 
we do not have a specific acquisition budget for since the timing and size of acquisitions are not predictable 
we intend to use borrowings under our bank credit facility  or other debt or equity financings to the extent available  to finance significant acquisitions 
the availability and attractiveness of these sources of financing will depend upon a number of factors  some of which will relate to our financia l condition and performance and some of which will be beyond our control  such as prevailing interest rates  oil and natural gas prices and other market conditions 
we entered into a million revolving credit facility on december  with toronto dominion texas  inc as administrative agent 
the bank credit facility is a three year revolving credit line with a current borrowing base of million 
indebtedness under the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
all of our subsidiaries are guarantors of this indebtedness 
the revolving credit line is subject to borrowing base availability  which is redetermined semiannually based on the banks estimates of the future net cash flows of our oil and gas properties 
the borrowing base may be affected by the performance of our properties and changes in oil and gas prices 
the determination of the borrowing base is at the sole discretion of th e administrative agent and the bank group 
the revolving credit line bears interest  based on the utilization of the borrowing base  at our option at either i libor plus to or ii the corporate base rate generally the federal funds rate plus plus to 
the bank credit facility matures on january  and contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to pay cash dividends  limit the amount of our consolidate d debt and limit our ability to make certain loans and investments 
financial covenants include the maintenance of a current ratio  maintenance of tangible net worth and maintenance of an interest coverage ratio 
on march   we closed the sale in a private placement of million of our senior notes due at a net price of after the placements agents discount 
as a result of this transaction  million of aggregate principal amount of our senior notes are outstanding 
the net proceed s were used to reduce amounts outstanding under our bank credit facility 
these notes are unsecured obligations of comstock and are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries 
on july   we filed a registration statement on form s t o register the million of these notes for resale 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on august  the following table summarizes our aggregate liabilities and commitments b y year of maturity total in thousands bank credit facility 
 senior notes  other debt operating leases derivative liabilities 
preferred stock    represents the redemption of our series a convertible preferred stock which at our option  can be paid in shares of our common stock 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under the bank credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations and future growth as contemplated under our current business plan 
however  if our plans or assumptions change or if our assumptions prove to be inaccurate  we ma y be required to seek additional capital 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital  or if such capital is available  that we will be able to obtain it on acceptable terms 
federal taxation at december   we had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
we have established a million valuation allowance against part of the net operating loss carryforward s acquired from devx energy  inc due to a change in control limitation which will prevent us from fully realizing these carryforwards 
the carryforwards expire from through the value of these carryforwards depends on our ability to generate future taxable income in order to utilize these carryforwards 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimate s and use assumptions that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities revenues or expenses 
we are also required to select among alternative acceptable accounting policies 
there are two generally acceptable methods for accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the full cost method allows th e capitalization of all costs associated with finding oil and gas reserves  including certain general and administrative expenses 
the successful efforts method allows only for the capitalization of costs associated with developing proven oil and gas properties as well as exploration costs associated with successful exploration projects 
costs related to exploration that are not successful are expensed when it is determined that commercially productive oil and gas reserves were not found 
we have elected to use the successful efforts method to account for our oil and gas activities and we do not capitalize any o f our general and administrative expenses 
the determination of depreciation  depletion and amortization expense as well as impairments that are recognized on our oil and gas properties are highl y dependent on the estimates of the proved oil and natural gas reserves attributable to our properties 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves and their values  including many factor s beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment as a result  estimates of different engineers may vary 
in addition  estimates of reserves are subject to revision based on the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of such estimate 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas reserves that are ultimately recovered 
the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves used in preparation of our financial statements were determined by an independent petroleum engineering consulting firm and were prepared in accordance with the rules promulgated by the sec and the financial accounting standards board the fasb 
the determination of impairment of our oil and gas reserves is based on the oil and gas reserve estimates using projected future oil and natural gas prices that we have determined to be reasonable 
the projected prices that we employ represent our long term oil and natural gas price forecast and may be higher or lower than current market prices for crude oil an d natural gas 
for the impairment review of our oil and gas properties that we conducted as of december   we used an initial oil price of per barrel and an initial natural gas price of per mcf 
such prices were reduced to per barrel for oil and per mcf for gas in the second year and escalated each year thereafter to a maximum price of per barrel for oil and per mcf for natural gas 
to the extent we had used lower prices in our impairment review  an impairment could have been indicated on certain of our oil and gas properties 
new accounting standards in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard s no 
sfas accounting for asset retirement obligations  which we adopted effective january  this statement requires us to record a liability in the period in which an asset retirement obligation aro is incurred 
upon recognition of an aro liability  additional asset cost would be capitalized to equal the amount of the liability 
upon the initial adoption of sfas  we recognized a liability for any existing aros not already provided for in our reserve for future abandonment costs 
we also recognized additional capitalized cost related to the additional liability and accumulated depreciation on the additional capitalized cost 
under sfas  we estimate that our total aro for our oil and natural gas properties is approximately million which was million less than the liability that we had provided for in our reserve for future abandonment as of december  the impact of adopting sfas  which will be recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change was an increase to net income of approximately million  net of tax 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
the statement establishes accounting and reporting standards that are effective for exit or disposal activities beginning after december  which require that a liability be recognized for an exit or disposal activity when that liability is incurred 
we have not determined the effect  if any  tha t the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires an entity to recognize a liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
this liability would be recorded at the inception of a guarantee and would be measured at fair value 
certain guarantees are excluded from the measurement and disclosure provisions while certain other guarantees are excluded from the measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the measurement provisions of this statement apply prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure provisions of the statement apply to financial statements for periods ending after december  the adoption of the statement is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements when adopted 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires an entity to consolidate a variabl e interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the entity does not have a majority of voting interests 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of this statement apply at inception for any entity created after january  for an entity created before februar y   the provisions of this interpretation must be applied at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june  comstock i s not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entities  and accordingly  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements when adopted 
related party transactions in recent years we have not entered into any material transactions with ou r officers or directors apart from the compensation they are provided for their services 
we also have not entered into any business transactions with our significant stockholders or any other related parties 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s oil and natural gas prices our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
thes e commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
factors influencing oil an d natural gas prices include the level of global demand for crude oil  the foreig n supply of oil and natural gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions which determin e the demand for natural gas  the price and availability of alternative fuels and overall economic conditions 
it is impossible to predict future oil and natural gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in our oil and natural gas reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can have an adverse affect on our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and natural gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on our oil and natural gas production in  a change in the pric e per barrel of oil would have resulted in a change in our cash flow for such period by approximately million and a change in the price per mcf of natural gas would have changed our cash flow by approximately million 
we periodically use hedging transactions with respect to a portion of our oil and natural gas production to mitigate our exposure to price changes 
while the use of these hedging arrangements limits the downside risk of price declines  such use may also limit any benefits which may be derived from price increases 
we use swaps  floors and collars to hedge oil and natural gas prices swaps are settled monthly based on differences between the prices specified in the instruments and the settlement prices of futures contracts quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
generally  when the applicable settlement price i s less than the price specified in the contract  we receive a settlement from the counterparty based on the difference multiplied by the volume hedge 
similarly  when the applicable settlement price exceeds the price specified in the contract  we pay the counterparty based on the difference 
we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty for floors when the applicable settlement price is less than the price specified in the contract  which is based on the difference multiplied by the volumes hedged 
for collars  we generally receive a settlement from the counterparty when the settlement price is below the floor and pay a settlement to the counterparty when the settlement price exceeds the cap 
no settlement occurs when the settlement price falls between the floor and cap 
the following table sets out the derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  which are held for natural gas price risk management volume type floor period beginning period ending mmbtu of instrument price january  december   floor the fair value of the commodity price derivative financial instruments at december  was a net asset of  in  we hedged a portion of our natural gas production for the period april through october  in order to increase the predictability of our cash flow from operations in order to support our drilling program 
we entered into price swaps covering mmbtus per day of our natural gas production at an average price of for april to october we realized a million gain on this hedge position in  which was included in oil and gas sales and increased our average natural gas price realization from per mcf to per mcf 
interest rates at december   we had long term debt of million 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the fair market value of the fixed rate debt as of december  was million based on the market price of of the face amount 
we had million outstanding under our bank credit facility  which is subject to floating market rates of interest 
borrowings under the bank credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is tied to libor or the corporate base rate  at our option 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
based on borrowings outstanding at decembe r   a basis point change in interest rates would change our interest expense on our variable rate debt by approximately million 
from january to april  we had an interest rate swap in place which fixed our libor rate on million of our floating rate debt at 
as a result of this interest rate swap  we realized a loss of  in in december we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge the impact of interest rate changes on million of our floating rate debt beginning on january  and expiring on december  this interest rate swap fixe d libor at 
the fair value of this interest rate derivative financial instrument was a net liability of  at december
