item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general through our divisions and subsidiaries  we engage in the business of designing  manufacturing and distributing medical devices 
our therapeutics division markets award winning enteral nutrition delivery devices 
our physical evaluation division markets industry leading physical evaluation testing systems 
our applied technology division designs and manufactures advanced medical components and systems for original equipment manufacturers oem s 
see discussion of our segments in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations as an aid to understanding our operating results  the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain items in the income statement bear to revenues 
year ended december income statement data percentage of gross sales revenue gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating income impairment loss on securities other income expense income loss before taxes provisions for taxes net income loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year  a decrease 
we believe the decrease in revenue is largely due to the delay and decrease of several orders for contract manufactured products  including those related to a customer which has reorganized its corporate structure through a spin out from its parent  a customer which has been reducing inventory levels and safety stock  and a customer which has delayed orders due to an issue not involving us  an overall decline in orders for stationary enteral nutrition delivery pump disposable sets  our difficulty in maintaining a steady flow of contract manufacturing products upon completion of certain projects  and weaker demand for physical evaluation products  as clinicians were hesitant to make capital equipment purchases during a period of economic uncertainty 
we did experience  however  a number of developments that positively impacted revenue in during the second half of scheduled shipments of surgical handpieces and ultrasonic sensors increased compared to the first six months of through the last three quarters of  we continued our engineering on a time and materials development program for a mobile organ perfusion system 
further  during the fourth quarter of we have experienced an increase in orders for private label enteral feeding pumps from a european customer 
during  revenue of the stationary enteral nutrition delivery pump disposable sets stabilized  achieving sales of approximately million in each quarter 
revenue of our physical evaluation products were greatest during the fourth quarter of  when we achieved sales of million 
looking forward  there are some developments that we believe will contribute to revenue in we are in the process of completing the development of new surgical handpieces  which we expect will be followed by production orders 
we are also developing several new ultrasonic and optoelectronic sensor products applications for certain customers 
the percentage of revenue generated from the marketing of our proprietary products increased when compared to revenues from contract manufacturing 
in  of our revenue was derived from proprietary products marketed by us  in comparison to in sales of our therapeutics products accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  sales from our physical evaluation product line accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  thirty eight percent of our revenue during was derived from products manufactured for and sold to our contract manufacturing customers  compared to in this shift in revenue sources from our contract manufacturing customers to proprietary products over the last three years has the benefit of decreasing the percentage of our revenues generated by a small number of major customers 
during and  no single customer accounted for over of our revenue 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  compared to in we attribute the increase in gross profit percentage from to to improvements in manufacturing and distribution efficiencies and the particular product mix delivered during the year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased during to  of sales  as compared to  of sales in although we have decreased certain general and administrative costs  we are continuing our investment in building our domestic sales forces for the physical evaluation and therapeutics divisions  and in growing international revenue of all product lines 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses from was partially due to additional legal and professional costs incurred due to a record number of patent applications  our response to the office of the inspector general s nationwide investigation into billing practices in the enteral device market  and the elimination of goodwill amortization as of january  with the adoption of sfas no 
see note of the financial statements for more information on the effect of this accounting change 
we believe that selling  general  and administrative expenses will decrease to approximately of gross revenue in we combine the resources of our full time engineers and several other independent contractors  to perform research and development projects 
we invested  in   in  and  in for research and development of new products 
in  research and development costs represented approximately of our annual revenue  compared to in and in we are continuing our efforts to develop and introduce new proprietary products and are currently planning new product introductions during the next fiscal year 
additionally  we are investing in developing proprietary component technologies for our contract manufacturing services 
we expect research and development costs to be approximately of revenue during depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to  in from  in the decrease is due to the elimination of goodwill amortization as of january  with the adoption of sfas no 
see note of the financial statements for more information on the effect of this accounting change 
goodwill held by us represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and other specifically identified intangible assets obtained in acquisitions by zevex 
the current value of goodwill included in the financial statements is  and represents approximately of total assets 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
see note of the financial statements for more information on the effect of adopting these pronouncements 
we had income tax expense of  in compared to an income tax benefit of  for the increase from to is primarily due to increased income before taxes as described above 
for  our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate largely as a result of a reduction in our valuation allowance see below  research and development tax credits  and charitable contribution deductions 
for our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate largely as a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization 
at december   we had net current deferred tax assets of approximately  realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately  in taxable income in the year the assets are realized 
management believes that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
zevex  through our sale of the aborn corporate shell in  generated a capital loss carryover of approximately  in  a valuation allowance of  was established 
in   of the carryover was utilized and the valuation allowance was reduced 
because we have not determined that it is more likely than not that the remaining carryover will be realized prior to its expiration  a valuation allowance has been established for the remaining amount 
during  we made a charitable contribution of certain patent rights to an institution of higher education with a fair market value of  during a tax benefit of  as determined based upon applicable federal rates  was recognized for the charitable contribution 
for income tax purposes  charitable contributions are only recognizable if a company has taxable income 
a valuation allowance of approximately  has been provided for the contribution carryover of  generated from the patent donation because we do not consider it to be more likely than not that this carryover will be utilized 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances annually 
operating income decreased to  of revenue in compared to  of revenue in we had net income of  of gross revenue in  compared to a net loss of  of revenue in the increase in net income during  as compared to  is due to a number of factors  including  the one time impairment loss on marketable securities in the amount of  in the third quarter  higher gross profit achieved in  a reduction in interest expense from  to  due to decreased debt and lower interest rates  nonamortization of goodwill under sfas no 
 which was adopted as of january   and the tax benefit derived from a capital loss  which  for the state of utah  was treated as a net operating loss carryback for income tax purposes and resulted in a refund recognized in however  the impact of these changes was reduced by lower revenue during of our annual and quarterly operating results are affected by acceptance in the markets for our proprietary and contract manufactured products  including the volume and timing of customer orders  which vary due to i variation in demand for the customers products or services as a result of  among other things  product life cycles  competitive conditions  and general economic conditions  ii the customers attempt to balance their inventory  iii the customers need to adapt to changing regulatory conditions and requirements  and iv changes in the customers preferences or strategies 
technical difficulties and delays in the design and manufacturing processes may also affect such results 
the foregoing factors may cause fluctuations in revenues and variations in product mix  which could in turn cause fluctuations in our gross margin 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenue was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the prior year  a decrease 
we attribute the decline to the poor overall economic conditions in  a slowdown on placement of orders from manufacturing customers  and a decline in the sales of stationary enteral delivery sets 
in line with our strategy over the past few years  the percentage of revenues from the marketing of our proprietary products increased when compared to revenue from contract manufacturing 
in  of our revenue was derived from proprietary products sold by us  in comparison to in revenue of our therapeutics products accounted for approximately of total revenue for the years ended december  and revenue from our physical evaluation product line accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  forty four percent of our revenues during were derived from products manufactured for and sold to contract manufacturing customers  compared to in during  no single customer accounted for over of our revenue  as compared to  where two customers accounted for over of our revenues 
our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  as compared to in management attributes the slight increase in gross profit percentage from to  to recognizing the benefits of our manufacturing resource planning system  but this was offset by higher than expected cost of goods and distribution costs associated with the acquired nestle business 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased during to  of gross revenue  as compared to  of gross revenue in general and administrative expenses increased as we hired additional accounting and administrative personnel to implement financial controls  hired specialists to manage inventories  and incurred over  in support expenses and depreciation related to our manufacturing resource planning software 
legal and professional costs increased  over the prior year  due to a record number of patent applications and our response to the office of the inspector general s nationwide investigation into billing practices in the enteral device market 
we also experienced an increase in expenses related to employees  such as insurance  taxes  and pension benefits 
during  we utilized a combination of our full time engineers and independent contractors to perform research and development projects 
during the first quarter of  we restructured our engineering group to primarily focus on manufacturing  and utilizing more independent contractors for research and development projects 
we invested  in   in  and  in for research and development of new products 
in  research and development costs represented approximately of our annual revenues  compared to  when research and development costs represented approximately of our annual revenues 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to  in from  in this increase primarily reflects increased depreciation and amortization from the nestle purchased assets and our self manufactured enteral pumps placed in service under usage programs during depreciation and amortization expenses also include depreciation of capital expenditures for property and equipment used in engineering and manufacturing  as well as our manufacturing resource planning mrp software 
goodwill held by us represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and other specifically identified intangible assets obtained in acquisitions by zevex 
goodwill amortization lives were determined by comparing recent acquisitions of similar companies and within similar industries 
prior to  goodwill was amortized over periods ranging from to years 
the value of goodwill included in the financial statements at december  was  and represented approximately of total assets 
during the third quarter of  under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss on our available for sale securities of  we subsequently sold all of those securities during the first quarter of we had an income tax benefit of  in compared to an income tax expense of  for the decrease from to is primarily due to decreased income before taxes 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate largely as a result of nondeductible goodwill amortization 
at december   we had net current deferred tax assets of approximately  realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately  in taxable income in the year the assets are realized operating income decreased to  of gross revenue in  compared to  of gross revenue in similarly  we had a net loss of  of revenue in  compared to net income of  of revenue in the changes during as compared to are principally due to the items addressed above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have consisted of cash flow from operations  borrowings under our revolving line of credit  and the other financial arrangements described below 
in some prior years  we also increased working capital through the issuance of stock and may do so in the future 
cash flow provided from operating activities for was  compared to cash flow provided in of  in  cash flow provided by operating activities was primarily associated with the reduction of accounts receivable due to better collection procedures and reduction in inventories as we continued to stream line our purchasing and manufacturing processes 
cash flow used in investing activities during was  and relates primarily to the purchase of equipment used for manufacturing  offset by the sale of marketable securities 
cash flow provided from operating activities for was  in  cash provided by operating activities was primarily associated with reduction of accounts receivable due to better collection procedures and reduction in inventories as we recognized the benefit of our manufacturing resource planning software and converted inventory into self constructed enteral pumps for placement in the enteral marketplace 
cash flows provided by investing activities were  largely as a result of the sale of securities held by zevex 
our working capital at december  was  compared to  at december  our decrease in working capital of  in was primarily due to the reduction of accounts receivable and inventories and payment of current debt outstanding at december  the portion of working capital represented by cash and short term investments at such dates was  and  respectively

other as part of a nationwide investigation into billing practices associated with enteral nutrition delivery products  particularly in regard to billing practices for pumps and disposable delivery sets  on july   the office of inspector general oig  served a subpoena on our zevex  inc subsidiary 
according to published reports  the investigation involved most manufacturers  distributors and health care service providers in the united states enteral pump industry and similar subpoenas were served on many of those parties 
the subpoena requested documents relating to our enteral pump customers  marketing and billing practices 
we have responded to the subpoena and are cooperating with the investigation 
at this time we are uncertain as to any future impact this investigation will have on our operations or financial position

critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s release numbers cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies and  commission statement about management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts as a general policy  collateral is not required for accounts receivable  however  we periodically monitor the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon expected collections of accounts receivable and specific identification of uncollectible accounts 
additionally  customers financial condition and credit worthiness are regularly evaluated 
historically losses on collections have not been material 
as of december   we have recorded an allowance for bad debts of  approximately of accounts receivable 
product and inventory obsolescence rapid change and technological innovation characterize the marketplace for medical products 
as a result  we and our customers are subject to the risk of product and inventory obsolescence  whether from prolonged development or government approval cycles or the development of improved products or processes by competitors 
in addition  the marketplace could conclude that the task for which a customer s medical product was designed is no longer an element of a generally accepted diagnostic or treatment regimen 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
as of december   we have recorded an obsolescence reserve in the amount of  which is approximately of inventories 
sales returns and warranty we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances and warranty reserve on products we have sold 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and warranty expenses and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns and warranty expenses  revenue could be overstated and expenses could be understated 
we have recorded a sales return and warranty expense allowance in the amount of  as of december  revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from products sold directly to end customers when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  shipment is made and collectibility is reasonably assured 
shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and are included in cost of sales 
contracts to perform engineering design and product development services are generally performed on a time and materials basis 
revenue is recognized as milestones are achieved  costs are expensed as incurred 
the accounting standards executive committee of the american institute of certified public accountants issued statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  in october sop  provides authoritative guidance on software revenue recognition  applies to all entities that earn revenue from licensing  selling or otherwise marketing software 
our physical evaluation product line derives a portion of its revenue from software products that include post contract customer support 
we have recorded deferred revenue in the amount of  for such post contract customer support as of december  impairment we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of fixed assets  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
the cost of the acquired companies was allocated first to identifiable assets based  on estimated fair values 
intangible assets consist of goodwill  contracts  patents  and licenses 
effective in  as discussed in new accounting pronouncements  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or  under certain circumstances  more frequent impairment test  based on its estimated fair value 
other intangible assets will generally continue to be amortized over their useful lives and also will be subject to an impairment test based on estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in the future 
currently  we assess the impairment of fixed assets and identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following o a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o a significant change in the manner of how we use the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  o a significant negative industry or economic trend 
when we determine that one or more of the above indicators of impairment exist  we evaluate the carrying amounts of the affected assets 
the evaluation  which involves significant management judgment  is based on various analyses including cash flow and profitability projections 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the related long lived assets  the carrying amount of the underlying assets will be reduced  with the reduction charged to expense  so that the carrying amount is equal to fair value  primarily determined based on future discounted cash flows  using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately million as of december  net fixed assets amounted to approximately million as of december  the effect of eliminating amortization for goodwill will be a reduction of expenses of approximately  annually 
for further information  see the discussion under new accounting pronouncements below 
income taxes income taxes are recorded based on the liability method  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized  as determined based on our analyses of projected taxable income  including tax strategies available to generate future taxable income 
our analyses of future taxable income are subject to a wide range of variables  many of which involve our estimates  and therefore our deferred tax asset may not be ultimately realized 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  use of the pooling of interests method is no longer permitted 
sfas no 
also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that is completed after june  sfas no 
no longer permits the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
instead  these assets must be reviewed annually or more frequently under certain conditions for impairment in accordance with this statement 
this impairment test uses a fair value approach  rather than the undiscounted cash flows approach previously required 
intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
see below 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  sfas no 
provided a six month period from the effective date of adoption for the company to complete step determining and comparing the fair value of our reporting units to their carrying values of the transitional impairment test 
step is required to be completed if step indicates that the carrying value of the reportable units exceeds their fair value and involves the calculation of the implied fair value of goodwill and must be completed by december  we completed step of the impairment assessment 
based upon our valuation procedures  we have determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value including goodwill 
as such we are not required to complete step of the impairment assessment and no impairment loss has been recognized in in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

in november of  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of accounting for arrangements whereby a vendor performs multiple revenue generating activities 
this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the related revenue should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting 
this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into for fiscal periods beginning after june  we plan to adopt eitf in the third quarter which begins on july  we believe that the effect of eitf on our results of operations  financial position or liquidity will not be material as we currently have few multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
in december of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  and interim periods beginning after december  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
have been adopted by us 
sfas no 
did not require us to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by apb no 
 to account for employee stock options 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant
