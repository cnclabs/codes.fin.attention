overview the company s water transmission products are manufactured in its portland  oregon  denver  colorado  adelanto and riverside  california  parkersburg  west virginia  and saginaw  texas facilities 
tubular products are manufactured in the company s portland  oregon  atchison  kansas  houston  texas  bossier city  louisiana  and monterrey  mexico facilities 
the company believes that the tubular products business  in conjunction with the water transmission business  provide a significant degree of market diversification  because the principal factors affecting demand for water transmission products are different from those affecting demand for tubular products 
demand for water transmission products is generally based on population growth and movement  changing water sources and replacement of aging infrastructure 
demand can vary dramatically within the company s market area since each 
table of contents population center determines its own waterworks requirements 
demand for tubular products is influenced by construction activity  the energy market and general economic conditions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from construction contracts in the company s water transmission segment is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of total costs incurred to date to the estimated total costs of each contract 
estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for all projects that are fifty percent or more complete except that major projects  usually over million  are reviewed earlier if sufficient production has been completed to provide enough information to revise the original estimated total cost of the project 
all cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by greater than one percent are reviewed by senior management personnel 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the company s board of director s 
revenue from the company s tubular products segment is recognized when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments and from contract disputes 
the extension and revision of credit is established by obtaining credit rating reports or financial information of a potential customer 
trade receivable balances are evaluated at least monthly 
if it is determined that the customer will be unable to meet its financial obligation to us as a result of a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s financial position  contract dispute  product claim or other similar events  a specific allowance is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the expected recovery amount given all information presently available 
a general allowance is recorded for all other customers based on certain other factors including the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience with individual customers 
as of december   the accounts receivable balance of million is 
table of contents reported net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million 
the company believes the reported allowances at december   are adequate 
if the customers financial conditions were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may need to be recorded  which would result in additional selling  general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
historically  actual results have been within management s estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of the company s board of director s 
long lived assets property  plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the disposal of long lived assets 
the company assesses impairment of property  plant and equipment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with all acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
when the company determines that the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment or goodwill will not be recoverable  the company calculates and records impairment losses using future undiscounted cash flows 
the company estimates future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about the expected future operating performance of the company 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to its business operations 
as required under sfas no 
 the company performed its annual assessment for impairment of the goodwill as of december  the company determined that the undiscounted sum of expected future cash flows exceeded the carrying amount of the goodwill  so the company did not recognize an impairment in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in estimating future sales  the company used its internal budgets 
the company developed its budget based on recent sales data for existing products  planned timing of new product launches and customer commitments related to existing and newly developed products 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
finished goods are stated at standard cost  which approximates the first in  first out method of accounting 
raw material inventories of steel coil are stated at cost on a specific identification basis or at standard cost 
raw material inventories of coating and lining materials  as well as materials and supplies  are stated on an average cost basis 
income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted income tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
self insurance the company is self insured for health claims for certain employees 
in addition  the company is self insured for a portion of losses and liabilities associated with workers compensation claims 
losses are accrued based upon 
table of contents the company s estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred using historical experience and  for workers compensation  certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry 
postretirement benefits the company has two defined benefit pension plans that are frozen 
the company funds these plans to cover current plan costs plus amortization of the unfunded plan liabilities 
to record these obligations  management uses estimates relating to assumed inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  and discount rates 
management along with third party actuaries review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial information regarding costs and expenses expressed as a percentage of total net sales and net sales of the company s business segments 
year ended december  net sales water transmission tubular products total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income gross profit as a percentage of segment net sales water transmission tubular products year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased slightly to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily a result of lower production levels that resulted from a lower bidding activity that began in the latter part of the third quarter of starting in the third quarter of and continuing into early first quarter  the bid dates on over million of projects were delayed until later in most of these projects were rescheduled to bid in the first quarter of approximately of these projects were postponed because of design or qualification revisions  were postponed because all permits or right of ways had not been finalized and another were postponed due to political considerations 
although we do not believe these delays are indicative of a softening water transmission market  they have resulted in a reduction of our backlog to million as of december   one of the lowest amounts that we have experienced in the last few years 
the low backlog at the end of  and slow bidding activity at the beginning of  will likely result in production levels in the first half of that are somewhat lower than for the same period in the 
table of contents company has seen the market improve recently and currently expects the total market may somewhat exceed the market 
tubular products sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of the continued impact of the slow economy that began in the company has seen improvement in demand in certain of its product lines in the first quarter of the most significant has been in the energy market 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in water transmission gross profit decreased as a result of lower volume and a less favorable mix of projects being produced 
the low backlog at the end of will have an impact on the gross profit in the first half as our facilities continue to operate at less than optimal levels 
although periods of slow bidding activity and the increased competitive pressure that is generally experienced during such periods typically results in lower margins  we have not seen margins decline significantly on projects booked so far in the first quarter of we believe that the significant number of projects that are scheduled to bid in the first few months of may be limiting the impact of downward market pressures on margins 
strong bidding activity should allow the company to improve its backlog and production utilization level in the latter part of the first half of and see improved results in the second half of gross profit from tubular products decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in tubular products gross profit decreased in as a result of decreased volume  higher cost steel and higher cost of production that resulted from lower levels of plant utilization 
in the second quarter of steel suppliers began to aggressively raise the price of steel coil  our primary raw material and the required lead times for delivery began to lengthen 
we were successful in passing on the majority of the early steel price increases to our customers 
the slow economy and import pricing pressures  however  did not allow us to fully pass on the additional steel price increases we experienced to our customers 
this resulted in erosion of our gross profit as the spread between our steel costs and our prices shrunk 
in the first quarter of  we have seen steel prices begin to decline  which has helped to modestly improve our spread 
however  continued pricing pressure  soft demand and high cost inventory continue to hamper the return to margin levels we generated prior to the steel price increases 
we believe a combination of further reductions in our steel costs and increased demand for our products is required to return the spread to past margin levels 
in recent months we have seen our backlog in our tubular products group improve as demand in several of our product lines increased somewhat  most notably in the energy market 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in the decrease was primarily the result of lower professional fees million  the elimination of the amortization of goodwill million and lower advertising  promotion and travel expenses million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense resulted from lower interest rates and the completion of million in sale leaseback transactions in june  the proceeds of which were used to reduce debt 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was approximately in compared to in year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased slightly to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or 
table of contents water transmission sales increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily a result of higher production that resulted from a significantly improved market in the first three quarters of compared to the same period in tubular products sales decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily the result of aggressive imports in certain product lines  lower energy prices resulting in reduced demand for energy products and a slowing economy 
gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in water transmission gross profit increased as a result of increased volume of orders that were booked while bidding activity was strong in the first three quarters of this resulted in increased backlog and improved margins on the projects booked during this period and a favorable production mix in gross profit from tubular products decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in tubular products gross profit decreased in as a result of decreased volume  increased pricing pressure from imported products in certain product lines  decrease in energy product demand and pricing and higher costs of production that resulted from low plant utilization 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in the increase was primarily the result of the settlement of old outstanding disputed claims million  higher personnel expense million and higher legal fees million 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense resulted from the completion of million in sale leaseback transactions in  the proceeds of which were used to reduce debt and lower interest rates 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was approximately in compared to in liquidity and capital resources the company generally finances its operations through cash flows from operations and available borrowings 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  and available borrowings of million 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of million of net income  non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  decrease in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  inventories  and trade receivables of  and million  respectively  and an increase in accounts payable of million 
the decrease in cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  inventories  trade receivables resulted from the decreased demand in the water transmission segment of the business 
the increase in accounts payable resulted from the large shipment of steel by our steel suppliers at the end of the year 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  which primarily related to additions of property and equipment of million  the exercise of the purchase option on a sale leaseback of machinery and equipment for million  and the repurchase and completion of a new sale leaseback transaction that resulted 
table of contents in the net purchase of million of machinery and equipment 
capital expenditures are expected to be between and million in net cash provided by financing activities in was million  which primarily resulted from borrowings under the company s credit agreement of million partially offset by long term debt payments of million 
the company had the following significant components of debt at december  a million credit agreement under which million was outstanding  million of series a senior notes  million of series b senior notes  million of senior notes  an industrial development bond of million  and capital lease obligations of million 
the credit agreement expires on june   and is without collateral 
it bears interest at rates related to ibor or libor plus to at december   or at prime less at december  
at december   the company had million bearing interest at  partially offset by million in cash receipts that had not been applied to the loan balance and additional net borrowing capacity under the line of credit of million 
the senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on november  and require annual payments in the amount of million that began november  plus interest of paid semi annually on may and november the series a senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on april  and require annual payments in the amount of million that began april  plus interest at paid semi annually on april and october the series b senior notes in the principal amount of million mature on april  and require annual payments of million that began april  plus interest at paid semi annually on april and october the senior notes  series a senior notes and series b senior notes together  the notes are all unsecured 
the industrial development bond of million matures on april  and requires annual principal payments of  and monthly payments of interest 
the interest rate on the industrial development bonds is variable 
it was as of december  as compared to on december  the bonds are collateralized by property and equipment of the company and guaranteed by an irrevocable letter of credit 
the company leases certain hardware and software related to a company wide enterprise resource planning system and other equipment 
the future minimum lease payments under these capital leases and the present value of the minimum lease payments as of december  are million and million  respectively 
the aggregated interest rate on the capital leases is the company has operating leases with respect to certain manufacturing equipment that requires it to pay property taxes  insurance and maintenance 
under the terms of the operating leases  we sold the equipment to an unrelated third party the lessor who then leased the equipment to us 
these leases  along with the company s other debt instruments already in place  and an operating line of credit  best meet the company s near term financing and operating capital requirements compared to other available options 
upon termination or expiration of the operating leases  the company must either purchase the equipment from the lessor at a predetermined amount that does not constitute a bargain purchase  return the equipment to the lessor  or renew the lease arrangement 
if the equipment is returned to the lessor  the company has agreed to pay the lessor an amount up to the difference between the purchase amount and the residual value guarantee 
the majority of the operating leases contain the same covenants as the company s credit agreement as discussed below 

table of contents the following table sets forth the company s commitments under the terms of its debt obligations and operating leases total thereafter credit agreement the notes industrial development bond capital leases operating leases total obligations the credit agreement  the notes  capital leases and operating leases all require compliance with certain financial covenants 
the credit agreement and operating leases contain the following covenants minimum net earnings before tax plus interest expense net of capitalized interest expense  depreciation expense and amortization expense ebitda coverage ratio  maximum funded debt to ebitda  minimum tangible net worth  and ratio of unsecured funded debt to asset coverage 
the notes contain the following financial covenants consolidated indebtedness not to exceed of consolidated total capitalization  and minimum tangible net worth 
these covenants impose certain requirements with respect to the company s financial condition and results of operations  and place restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness and to create liens or other encumbrances on assets 
a failure by the company to comply with the requirements of these covenants  if not waived or cured  could permit acceleration of the related indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that include cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
at december   the company was in compliance with all covenants specified in its debt agreements 
the company s working capital requirements have stabilized due to a temporary decrease in the company s water transmission business and the continued slowness in tubular product sales 
the extended payment cycle of the water transmission business significantly affects the company s working capital requirements 
as volume decreases in the water transmission business  working capital requirements decrease as additional raw material  work in process and finished product awaiting shipment are less than the product being shipped 
this increase in shipments results in increased trade receivables that will result in increased collections 
as the volume of the water transmission and tubular product segments increase  working capital requirements will increase as investment in additional raw material  work in process and finished goods awaiting shipment is necessary to meet the increased volume 
recent business failures  the general downturn in the economy and continued conservatism in the lending community have affected the company s access to certain financial instruments 
current favorable short term rates under the company s credit agreement have allowed it to reduce total interest expense as the company uses proceeds under the credit agreement to make the required principal payments under the notes 
the company expects to continue to rely on cash generated from operations and other sources of available funds to make required principal payments under the notes during the company anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flows expected to be generated by operations and amounts available under its credit agreement will be adequate to fund its working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent necessary  the company may also satisfy capital requirements through additional bank borrowings  senior notes and capital and operating leases if such resources are available on satisfactory terms 
the company has from time to time evaluated and continues to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and expansion 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of the company s working capital or necessitate additional bank borrowings 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in addition  fin requires that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a significant variable interest in a vie make additional disclosures 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  thus  fin is effective for the company s third quarter of with transitional disclosure required with these financial statements 
the company will adopt these provisions in the third quarter of  however  based on its preliminary assessment the company does not believe it is a primary beneficiary of a vie or holds any significant interests or involvement in a vie and does not expect there to be an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and the interim disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december   this year end and the company s first quarter of  respectively 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made regarding obligations under certain issued guarantees by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements 
it also clarifies the requirement of a guarantor to recognize a liability at the inception of the guarantee at the fair value of the obligation 
fin does not provide specific guidance for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the guarantee 
the provisions relating to the initial recognition and measurement of a liability are applicable on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified subsequent to december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim and annual financial statements for periods ending after december  the company will adopt the provisions of this interpretation effective january  and does not expect it to have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue no 
was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated 
table of contents after december  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  recission of fasb statements  and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections 
sfas rescinds the provisions of sfas that requires companies to classify certain gains and losses from debt extinguishments as extraordinary items  eliminates the provisions of sfas regarding transition to the motor carrier act of and amends the provisions of sfas to require that certain lease modifications be treated as sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas related to classification of debt extinguishment are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of sfas related to lease modification are effective for transactions occurring after may  the company does not expect the provisions of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement applies to all entities 
it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  the company expects that the initial application of sfas will not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supersedes sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transaction 
sfas develops one accounting model for long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale 
sfas requires that long lived assets that are to be disposed of by sale be measured at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
additionally  sfas expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early application encouraged 
the company has completed an evaluation of the impact of sfas on the company s financial statements 
the statement did not have an impact because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas in june  the fasb issued sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after september  to be accounted for using the purchase method 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives  but with no maximum life 
the amortization provisions of sfas apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  with respect to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to july   the company adopted sfas effective january  sfas requires companies to review goodwill and other intangible assets annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the company completed its annual impairment review required by sfas and believes that no impairment of goodwill existed at december  
table of contents risk factors following are the key risk factors that have affected the company s net sales and net income in the past and could materially impact the company s future net sales and net income any decline in demand for public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business 
our water transmission business accounted for approximately of our net sales in our water transmission products are used primarily in public water transmission projects 
as a result  our sales could be impacted adversely by declines in the number of projects planned by public water agencies  government spending cuts  general budgetary constraints  difficulty in obtaining necessary permits or the inability of government entities to issue debt 
project delays in public water transmission projects could adversely affect our business 
the public water agencies constructing water transmission projects generally announce the projects well in advance of the bidding and construction process 
it is not unusual for projects to be delayed and rescheduled 
projects are delayed and rescheduled for a number of reasons  including changes in project priorities  difficulties in complying with environmental and other government regulations and additional time required to acquire rights of way or property rights 
delays in public water transmission projects may occur with too little notice to allow us to replace those projects in our manufacturing schedules 
as a result  our business may be adversely affected by unplanned downtime 
we have a significant amount of outstanding debt 
we have financed our operations through cash flow from operations  available borrowings and other financing arrangements 
the debt we have incurred could adversely affect us because our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital or other purposes in the future may be limited  a portion of our cash flow from operations and funds available under our credit agreement is dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our debt  which reduces funds available for operations  and certain of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  which cause us to be vulnerable to increases in interest rates 
our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt will depend on our future operating performance and cash flow  which are subject to prevailing economic conditions  prevailing interest rate levels and other financial  competitive and business factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our outstanding debt includes financial covenants that impose certain requirements with respect to our financial condition and results of operations 
these covenants place restrictions on  among other things  our ability to incur certain additional indebtedness and to create liens or other encumbrances on assets 
a failure to comply with the requirements of these covenants  if not waived or cured  could permit acceleration of the related indebtedness and acceleration of indebtedness under other instruments that include cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
we may be subject to claims for damages for defective products  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we warrant our products to be free of certain defects 
losses may result or be alleged to result from defects in our products  which could subject us to claims for damages  including consequential damages 
we are currently a defendant in a class action lawsuit alleging that a company we acquired manufactured and sold small diameter  thin walled fire sprinkler pipe that was defective 
the plaintiffs have not alleged damages in a specific amount but seek replacement costs for the allegedly defective pipe 
any claims relating to defective products that result in liability exceeding our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in steel prices may affect our future operating results 
purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales  particularly in our tubular products business 
the steel industry is highly cyclical in 
table of contents nature  and  at times  pricing can be highly volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  import duties  other trade restrictions and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect our cost of sales 
although we seek to recover increases in steel prices through price increases in our products  we have not always been completely successful 
any increase in steel prices that is not offset by increases in our prices could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is very competitive and increased competition could reduce our gross margins and net income 
we face significant competition 
orders in the water transmission business are competitively bid  and price competition can be vigorous 
there are many competitors in the tubular products business  and price is often a prime consideration for purchase of our products 
price competition may reduce our gross margins  which may adversely affect our net income 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our business could also be impeded if existing competitors expand  or if they or new competitors establish new facilities within our market areas 
our tubular products business faces intense competition from imports 
the level of imports of tubular products affects the domestic tubular products market 
high levels of imports may reduce the volume of tubular products sold by domestic producers and depress selling prices of tubular products 
we believe that import levels are affected by  among other things  overall worldwide demand for tubular products  the trade practices of foreign governments  government subsidies to foreign producers and governmentally imposed trade restrictions in the united states 
increased imports of tubular products in the united states and canada could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
on march   the president of the united states announced a tariffs and quota plan  which took effect march  the plan is effective for three years  requires a review in months and could be amended if the steel industry s financial situation changes over the three year period 
the plan includes a tariff on imported circular welded products  many of which compete with certain of our products 
on the next two anniversary dates of the plan  the tubular products tariff will decrease each year 
tariffs are subject to challenge by affected producers and countries 
changes in the plan resulting in a reduction or elimination of the tariffs may result in increased import competition 
our water transmission business faces competition from concrete and ductile iron pipe manufacturers 
water transmission pipe is manufactured generally from steel  concrete or ductile iron 
each pipe material has advantages and disadvantages 
steel and concrete are more common materials for larger diameter water transmission pipelines because ductile iron pipe generally is limited in diameter due to its manufacturing process 
the public agencies and engineers who determine the specifications for water transmission projects analyze these pipe materials for suitability for each project 
individual project circumstances normally dictate the preferred material 
if we experience cost increases in raw material  labor and overhead specific to our industry or the location of our facilities  while competing products or companies do not experience similar changes  we could experience a change in the demand  price and profitability of our products 
our quarterly operating results are subject to significant fluctuation 
our net sales and net income may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the size and schedule for deliveries of water transmission orders  the seasonal variation in demand for tubular products  fluctuations in the cost of steel and other raw materials  and competitive pressures 
results of operations in any period are not indicative of results for any future period  and comparisons between any two periods may not be meaningful 
recent accounting pronouncements may require us to write down our goodwill  which could materially impair our net worth 
in july  fasb issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that all business combinations be accounted for under the purchase method only and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
sfas requires that ratable amortization of goodwill be replaced 
table of contents with periodic tests of the goodwill s impairment and that intangible assets other than goodwill should be amortized over their useful lives 
we have million of goodwill recorded on our financial statements as of december  if  as a result of the implementation of sfas and or sfas  we are required to write down any of our goodwill  our net worth will be reduced 
since our credit agreement contains a covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum net worth  this reduction in net worth  if substantial  may result in an event of default under the credit agreement  which would prevent us from borrowing additional funds 
sfas requires companies to review annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we have completed our annual impairment review and believe that no impairment of goodwill exists at december  we depend on our senior management team  and the loss of any member could adversely affect our operations 
our success depends on the management and leadership skills of our senior management team 
the loss of any of these individuals  particularly brian w 
dunham  our president and chief executive officer  or our inability to attract  retain and maintain additional personnel  could prevent us from fully implementing our business strategy 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing senior management personnel or to attract additional qualified personnel when needed 
we have not entered into employment agreements with any of our senior management personnel  although we have an agreement with william r 
tagmyer  our chairman of the board 
the success of our business is affected by general economic conditions  and our business may be adversely affected by economic slowdown or recession 
periods of economic slowdown or recession in the united states  or the public perception that one may occur  could decrease the demand for our products  affect the price of our products and adversely impact our business 
we have been impacted by the general slowing of the economy and any worsening of the economic slowdown could have further negative impacts on our business 
our stock s relatively low trading volume may limit your ability to sell your shares 
although our shares of common stock are listed on the nasdaq national market  our average daily trading volume over the twelve months ended december  is approximately  shares 
as a result  holders of our shares may have difficulty selling a large number of shares of our common stock in the manner or at a price that might otherwise be attainable if our shares were more actively traded 
the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations  and may decline below the public offering price 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are our operating and financial performance and prospects  quarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators  such as earnings per share  net income and revenues  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts  loss of any member of our senior management team  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructuring  sales of our common stock by shareholders  general market conditions  and domestic and international economic  legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents we are subject to various environmental laws  which may require us to incur substantial costs  thereby reducing our profits 
failure to comply with environmental laws  regulations and permits  or changes in such laws  including the imposition of more stringent standards for discharges into the environment  could result in substantial operating costs and capital expenditures in order to maintain compliance and could also include fines and civil or criminal sanctions  third party claims for property damage or personal injury  cleanup costs or temporary or permanent discontinuance of operations 
certain of our facilities have been in operation for many years and  over time  we and other predecessor operators of these facilities may have generated  used  handled and disposed of hazardous and other regulated wastes 
environmental liabilities could exist  including cleanup obligations at these or at other locations where materials from our operations were disposed of  which could result in future expenditures that cannot be currently quantified and which could reduce our profits 
we have been notified by the environmental protection agency that we may be subject to potential liability in connection with a superfund assessment site in portland  oregon 
we cannot predict if it will be determined that we have liability with respect to this site  but any such determination could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain provisions of our governing documents and oregon law could discourage potential acquisition proposals 
our articles of incorporation contain provisions that classify the board of directors into three classes  each of which serves for a three year term with one class elected each year  provide that directors may be removed by shareholders only for cause and only upon the affirmative vote of of the outstanding shares of common stock  and permit the board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the number of shares constituting any such series  the voting powers and all other rights and preferences of any such series  without any further vote or action by our shareholders 
in addition  we are subject to the oregon business combination act  which imposes certain restrictions on business combination transactions and may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors 
we also have a shareholder rights plan that acts to discourage any person or group from making a tender offer for  or acquiring  more than of our common stock without the approval of our board of directors 
any of these provisions could discourage potential acquisition proposals  could deter  delay or prevent a change in control that our shareholders consider favorable and could depress the market value of our common stock 
we face risks in connection with potential acquisitions 
acquiring businesses that complement or expand our operations has been an important element of our business strategy in the past 
although we have not completed an acquisition since  we continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that may expand and complement our business 
we may not be able to successfully identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate favorable terms in the future 
furthermore  our ability to effectively integrate any future acquisitions will depend on  among other things  the adequacy of our implementation plans  the ability of our management to oversee and operate effectively the combined operations and our ability to achieve desired operation efficiencies 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of any businesses that we may acquire in the future  our earnings and profitability could be adversely affected
