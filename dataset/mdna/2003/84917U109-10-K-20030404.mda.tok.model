item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and accompanying notes and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors 
we are the leading retailer of sporting goods in the western united states 
given the economic characteristics of the store formats  the similar nature of the products sold  the type of customer and method of distribution  our operations are aggregated in one reportable segment as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
we  together with sports authority  announced on february  that our boards of directors have unanimously approved a definitive agreement providing for a merger of equals to create the nation s preeminent sporting goods retailer 
the combined company will be named the sports authority  inc and be headquartered in englewood  colorado 
the combined company will apply for listing on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol tsa 
the transaction is expected to be completed in the third calendar quarter of the combined company will have stores in states nationwide 
the merger is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval by our stockholders and the stockholders of sports authority as well as hart scott rodino approval under the united states antitrust laws 
the results of operations presented below represent our historical results only 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales and the number of stores open at the end of each period dollars rounded to millions fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars dollars dollars net sales  cost of goods sold  buying  distribution and occupancy gross profit operating expenses merger integration costs operating income interest expense other income  net income before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income number of stores at end of period newly opened stores enter the comparable store sales base at the beginning of their th full month of operation 
the oshman s stores are included in the comparable store sales base beginning august   the beginning of their th full month of operations since the date we acquired oshman s 
inventories are stated at the lower of last in  first out lifo cost or market 
we consider cost of goods sold to include the direct costs of merchandise  plus certain internal costs associated with procurement  warehousing  handling and distribution 
in addition to the full cost of inventory  cost of goods sold includes related occupancy costs and amortization and depreciation of leasehold improvements and rental equipment 
operating expenses include controllable and non controllable store expenses except occupancy  non store expenses and depreciation and amortization not associated with cost of goods sold 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis discusses the results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  accounts receivable  the recoverability of long lived assets including intangible assets  store closing reserves  income taxes  and the estimates used to record purchase accounting related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete listing of our significant accounting policies 
valuation of inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the average cost of items purchased and applying the dollar value last in  first out lifo inventory method 
our dollar value lifo pools are computed using the inventory price index computation ipic method 
lifo cost of our inventories is then compared to estimated market value 
this assessment of estimated market value is based on the quality and age of merchandise  the rate of sale of merchandise  the quantities on hand  and our assessment of the market conditions 
estimates and judgments are required in the determination of the market value of our inventory and future changes  like changes in customer merchandise preferences or unseasonable weather patterns  could cause changes in the market value of our inventory 
inventory shrinkage is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical inventory shrinkage trends 
we perform physical inventories at our stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for inventory shrinkage represents an estimate for inventory shrinkage for each of our locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
these estimates are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary from actual results 
vendor allowances we receive certain allowances from our vendors  which include rebates and cooperative advertising funds 
these amounts are negotiated with vendors typically on an annual basis and are  at times  dependent on projected purchase volumes and advertising plans 
the amounts are subject to changes in market conditions or marketing strategies of our vendors  and changes in our product purchases 
we record an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest information available with respect to purchase volumes  advertising plans and status of our negotiations with vendors 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb issued consensus no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
eitf no 
addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from the vendor 
we believe that the provisions of eitf could impact our financial reporting for certain vendor allowances by requiring recharacterization of amounts received from vendors from reduction of advertising expense to reduction of cost of inventory purchased 
we have not yet completed our assessment of the impact of this ruling on fiscal and are working with our vendors as new arrangements are negotiated to minimize the effects of eitf on our results of operations 
impairment of assets we review long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the value of long lived tangible and intangible assets is impaired 
store closing reserves prior to december  and the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded a provision for store closing when the decision was made by management to close a store 
in accordance with sfas no 
 for store closing activities initiated after december   we record a liability at fair value for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  when a liability is incurred rather than when the decision to close a store is made 
this will change the timing of recognition for certain exit costs  so that certain exit costs will be recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur 
the costs incurred in connection with store closings primarily consist of future net lease obligations  utilities  property taxes  and employee costs directly related to the store closing 
acquisitions accounting our acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the total costs of our acquisitions are allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
the determination of fair values involves the use of estimates and assumptions which could require adjustment in the future 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  we cannot guarantee that our estimates and assumptions will be accurate  which could require us to make adjustments to these estimates in future periods 
fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to  million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal last year s sales include oshman s results after the june  acquisition date compared to a full year of results for fiscal comparable store sales in fiscal  which includes the oshman s stores since august   were flat 
this comparable sales performance is the net effect of increases in several product categories offset by decreases in others 
comparative sales were strong in the first quarter of fiscal first quarter sales in apparel and hardgoods increased due to a strong late ski season in our markets  sales of merchandise related to the winter olympics in salt lake city and increased exercise equipment promotions 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the effects of the drought and forest fire activity in the rocky mountain region and the western united states fueled decreases in the camping  hunting and footwear departments 
third quarter sales increases were driven by licensed apparel sales as teams in our markets were involved in the major league baseball world series and playoffs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  there were increased sales in the activewear  athletic hardgood  bicycle and snowboard categories related primarily to the holiday selling season 
these increases were offset by decreases during the fourth quarter in the footwear  outdoor apparel and licensed apparel categories 
footwear was impacted by a less promotional environment versus the year ago fourth quarter and a mild winter experienced during the quarter in many of our markets  which also negatively impacted outdoor apparel sales 
further  sales for the fiscal year were negatively impacted by an overall challenging retail sales environment 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the increase as a percent of sales is due to a number of factors including a less promotional strategy taken during the year  synergies being realized from the oshman s acquisition  favorable inventory shrinkage results  systems investments  allowing us to better manage in stock positions  and the addition of key personnel in the buying organization  particularly in the softlines department 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal were million  or  of net sales compared to million  or  of net sales for fiscal operating expense dollars increased primarily due to the oshman s acquisition 
prior year operating expenses only include oshman s results after the june  acquisition date compared to a full year of expenses for fiscal as a percentage of sales  operating expenses were consistent with last year due to a continued focus on controlling all costs 
merger integration costs 
merger integration costs for fiscal were compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal  related to the oshman s acquisition 
we have has not incurred any merger integration costs since the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income for fiscal was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal excluding integration costs from fiscal  operating income increased million and from fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales in the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense is related to lower effective borrowing rates on amounts borrowed in  a settlement with the irs in the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements  lower average debt as a result of the net proceeds from the may common stock offering  offset by the higher average debt balance due to the acquisition of oshman s on june  and the shares repurchased under the common share repurchase program 
other income 
other income was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to non recurring items recorded in the prior year  including million of income related to a consulting services agreement  million of income recognized on the sales of marketable securities  and a one time gain of million on the sale of certain assets that were held in edmonton  alberta  canada 
these items were offset primarily by increased sales tax handling income in the current year  due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of oshman s 
income taxes 
our income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal our effective tax expense rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the change in our effective tax expense rate in fiscal was primarily due to changes in permanent tax differences as compared to fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the acquisition of oshman s increased sales by million 
fiscal consisted of weeks compared to weeks for fiscal total net sales  excluding oshman s and on a comparable week basis decreased by 
comparable store sales decreased for the comparable week period  primarily due to decreased sales in the hardgoods product category as a result of the decrease in scooter sales 
newly opened stores enter the comparable store sales base at the beginning of their fourteenth full month of operation 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of net sales as compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the slight increase as a percent to sales was primarily due to continued improvement in the replenishment and allocation of merchandise to our stores offset by increased occupancy costs as a percent of sales 
operating expenses 
operating expenses in fiscal were million  or  of net sales compared to million  or of net sales for fiscal as a percentage of sales  operating expenses decreased due to continued cost controls  including reduced advertising costs as a percent to sales and corporate payroll cost synergies achieved from the acquisition of oshman s 
these savings were offset by increased depreciation and amortization  primarily due to increased capital spending and amortization of the favorable lease and goodwill assets related to the oshman s acquisition 
the increase in total operating expenses is primarily due to the increased number of stores operated as a result of the acquisition of oshman s 
merger integration costs 
merger integration costs associated with the acquisition of oshman s for fiscal were million  or of net sales 
these costs consist primarily of million of duplicative costs to operate two corporate offices  employee training  and personnel integration  million of advertising costs for rebranding of stores and overlapping markets  million of costs associated with consolidating and relocating corporate offices and million of consulting fees 
operating income 
as a result of the factors described above  operating income for fiscal was million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal operating income excluding integration costs for fiscal was  or of net sales  an increase of million and as a percent to sales  versus fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in the effective borrowing rate excluding amortization of bank fees from approximately to approximately  offset by an increase in the level of borrowings as a result of the oshman s acquisition 
other income 
other income was for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in other income is primarily due to million of income related to a one time consulting services agreement  million of income recognized on the sale of marketable securities and million of income generated by the sale of certain nonoperating assets held in edmonton  alberta  canada 
the remaining increase is primarily attributable to increased sales tax handling income  due to increased sales volume as a result of the acquisition of oshman s 
income taxes 
our income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal our effective tax expense rate for fiscal was compared to a benefit of in fiscal the income tax benefit in the prior year reflected the reversal of valuation allowances  which had offset previously generated net operating losses  the majority of which were acquired in the purchase of sportmart during january liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory  capital improvements  and pre opening expenses to support our expansion plans  as well as for various investments in store remodeling  store fixtures and ongoing infrastructure improvements 
cash flow analysis fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands  except ratios cash provided by operating activities    cash used in investing activities    cash provided by used in financing activities   capital expenditures long term debt at end of period    working capital at end of period    current ratio at end of period long term debt to equity ratio at end of period cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of net income  adjusted for depreciation and amortization and deferred income taxes  offset by payments of accounts payable and accrued expenses and inventory purchases 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily for capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for new stores  store remodeling  store fixtures  and the purchase or enhancement of certain information systems  including the rollout of a new pos system 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal related primarily to proceeds from a public stock offering offset by an increase in borrowings under our line of credit due to our stock repurchase program 
our liquidity and capital needs have principally been met by cash from operations  proceeds from our stock offering and borrowings under a revolving credit facility with cit business credit  inc  as agent 
in connection with the oshman s acquisition  we increased our revolving line of credit from million to million 
long term debt currently consists of borrowings under the revolving credit facility  which allows us to borrow up to of our eligible inventories or the lesser of of eligible inventories or of the net liquidation percentage for one consecutive day period as defined in the revolving credit facility during the year 
borrowings are limited to the lesser of million or the amount calculated in accordance with the borrowing base  and are secured by substantially all inventories  trade receivables  equipment  and intangible assets 
the lenders may not demand repayment of principal  absent an occurrence of default  prior to june  the revolving credit facility  as amended  contains certain covenants  including financial covenants that require us to maintain specified earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest ratios 
the terms of our merger agreement with the sports authority restrict our ability to pay dividends prior to the consummation of the merger 
our ability to declare or pay dividends on our common stock is not limited under the revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit does  however  limit the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on the common stock of our subsidiaries and the amount of loans that may be made to us 
our subsidiaries may loan us amounts needed in the ordinary course of their business  as defined in the credit agreement and in addition  up to million in the aggregate and declare up to million in dividends each fiscal year 
beginning in august until august   our subsidiaries may loan us additional amounts  totalling up to million  to fund repurchases of our common stock 
we are in compliance with all covenants under the revolving credit facility 
in connection with the revolving credit facility  we pledged all of the outstanding common stock of our operating retail subsidiaries as collateral 
under the terms of the revolving credit facility  loan interest is payable monthly at chase manhattan bank s prime rate plus a margin rate that cannot exceed or  at our option  at chase manhattan bank s libor rate plus a margin that cannot exceed 
our margin rates for the first loan year were on prime and on libor borrowings 
the margin rates on borrowings during the term of the revolving credit facility may be reduced to as low as on prime and on libor  respectively  if certain earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda levels are achieved 
the margin rates on current borrowings under the revolving credit facility are on prime and on libor  based on our historical earnings levels 
there was million outstanding under the credit facility as of february   and million was available for borrowing 
on may   we completed a common stock offering for million shares 
this offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of million shares 
the proceeds were used to pay down debt in fiscal the balance of the shares were sold by various selling stockholders 
we did not receive any portion of the proceeds from the sale of shares by selling stockholders 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock totaling approximately million under a common share repurchase program approved by our board of directors 
as of february   we have authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to an additional million of shares of our common stock 
prior to consummation of the merger  the terms of our merger agreement with the sports authority prohibit us from additional repurchases without their prior written consent 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on june   expiring on june   and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on december   expiring on may   to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities 
under the swap agreements  we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable interest rate payments periodically over the life of the instrument 
the total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are million which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on july   the irs proposed adjustments to our and our former parent s now thrifty payless holdings  inc  a subsidiary of riteaid corporation and federal income tax returns in conjunction with our former parent s irs examination 
the proposed adjustments related to the manner in which lifo inventories were characterized on these returns 
on november   in order to eliminate the accrual of additional interest on taxes owed to the irs  we entered into an agreement with the irs  based upon the terms of the settlement that is currently pending between the irs and our former parent 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid the irs taxes of million and interest of million 
we believe this to be a full and complete settlement of all our separate return issues under review by the irs 
the irs settlement with our former parent has not been finalized 
under the terms of our tax sharing agreement with our former parent  we could be liable for amounts that arise out of our former parent s settlement with the irs 
based on management s discussions with our former parent and our settlement that was reached with the irs as described above  we believe our portion of the potential accelerated tax liability from the settlement with the irs by our former parent ranges from approximately to million 
we have a long term deferred tax liability of million recorded for the settlement of this matter 
we do not expect that any penalties will be assessed relating to this matter although we cannot be certain that penalties will not be assessed 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
capital expenditures are projected to be approximately to million in fiscal these capital expenditures will be primarily for new store openings  store remodeling  store fixtures  information systems  and distribution center facilities 
we lease all of our store locations and intend to continue to finance our new stores with long term operating leases 
based upon stores opened in fiscal  newly constructed superstores require a cash investment of approximately million for a  square foot store and approximately million for a  square foot store 
we opened eight new stores and relocated one store in fiscal we intend to open approximately fifteen new stores in fiscal the level of capital improvements will be affected by the mix of new construction versus renovation of existing retail space 
we believe that cash generated from operations  combined with funds available under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund projected capital expenditures  future common share purchases  if any  and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
we intend to utilize the revolving credit facility to meet seasonal fluctuations in cash flow requirements 
in conjunction with the pending merger with the sports authority  we have received a commitment from cit to provide us with a secured committed credit facility in the amount of million 
we believe that the available resources under this credit facility  combined with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund the combined entity  the costs incurred to integrate the companies as well as non recurring costs incurred as a result of this transaction 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments to facilitate an understanding of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  the following data is provided summary of commercial obligations and commitments payments due by period total within year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt   capital lease obligations  operating leases     total contractual cash obligations    amount of commitment expiration per period total within year years years after years in thousands other commercial commitments import letters of credit   standby letters of credit   total commercial commitments   interest rate and foreign currency risk management we entered into an interest rate swap agreement on june   expiring on june   and entered into a second interest rate swap agreement on december   expiring on may   to minimize the risks and costs associated with our financing activities 
under the swap agreements  we pay fixed rate interest and receive variable libor interest rate payments periodically over the life of the instrument 
the total notional amounts under the interest rate swaps are million  which do not represent the exposure due to credit loss 
our interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges  qualifying for the short cut method of assessing effectiveness and are considered highly effective  as defined by fasb statement no 
under the short cut method there is no need to measure effectiveness of the hedges and there is no charge to earnings for changes in the fair value of the swap agreements 
net settlements on the swap agreements are recorded as interest expense 
at february  the fair value of the swap agreements was a loss of  net of the related tax benefit 
the unrealized loss from these interest rate swaps are included in other comprehensive income and is shown as a component of stockholders equity 
our exposure to foreign currency risk is not material 
seasonality and inflation the following table sets forth our unaudited consolidated quarterly results of operations for each of the quarters in fiscal and this information is unaudited  but is prepared on the same basis as the annual financial information and  in the opinion of management  reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
the results of operations for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in millions net sales of full year net sales operating income fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in millions net sales of full year net sales operating income loss the results for the first two quarters of fiscal year are not comparable to the other periods presented due to the exclusion of oshman s results of operations  prior to june   the date of acquisition 
the fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter 
for fiscal and  the fourth quarter contributed and  respectively  of net sales 
we believe that two primary factors contribute to this seasonality first  sales of cold weather sporting goods and ski and snowboard merchandise during the fourth quarter are generally strong in anticipation of the ski and snowboard season  and second  holiday sales contribute significantly to our operating results 
as a result of these factors  inventory levels  which gradually increase beginning in april  generally reach their peak in november and then decline to their lowest level following the december holiday season 
any decrease in sales for the fourth quarter  whether due to a slow holiday selling season  poor snowfall in ski areas near our markets or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year 
although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation has a material impact on our results of operations 
we believe that we are generally able to pass along inflationary increases in costs to our customers 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
   amendment of sfas no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement eliminates extraordinary accounting treatment for reporting gain or loss on debt extinguishment 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases  to require sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions and changes the provisions under sfas related to original lessees being relieved of primary obligation under an original lease 
sfas no 
also makes various technical corrections to existing pronouncements that are not substantive in nature 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to the rescission of sfas no 
are effective in fiscal years beginning after may  with earlier application encouraged 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to sfas no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may   with earlier application encouraged 
all other provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued on or after may   with earlier application encouraged 
our adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for an exit cost or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas under eitf no 
 a liability was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of this statement has changed the timing of recognition for certain exit costs  so that certain exit costs are recognized over the period in which the exit activities occur 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for employee stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and its effect on reported results 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are included in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
we continue to apply the principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
in november  the eitf of the fasb issued consensus no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
eitf no 
addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from the vendor and addressed two issues 
on issue  the task force reached a consensus that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the reseller s income statement 
this presumption is overcome when the consideration is a reimbursement for specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred by the reseller to sell the vendor s products  in which case the cash consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the reseller s income statement 
additionally  the task force concluded on issue that a refund or a rebate of a specified amount of cash consideration payable only if the reseller completes a specified level of purchases should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation of the cash consideration offered to each of the underlying transactions that results in progress by the reseller toward earning the refund or rebate  provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
in its january meeting  the task force amended the transition guidance relative to adoption of eitf to require that the consensus on issue be applied to new arrangements  including modifications of existing arrangements  entered into after december  issue remains applicable to arrangements entered into after november  we have evaluated the arrangements entered into after either december  for issue or november  for issue and concluded that  given the effective start dates of such contracts and the seasonality of our operations  the impact on fiscal is immaterial 
we believe that the provisions of eitf could impact our fiscal by requiring recharacterization of amounts received from vendors from reduction of advertising expense to reduction of cost of inventory purchased 
we have not yet completed our assessment on fiscal of the impact of this ruling and are working with our vendors as new arrangements are negotiated to minimize the effects of eitf on our results of operations 
in november  fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others  fin was issued 
this interpretation requires the initial recognition and initial measurement  on a prospective basis only  of guarantees issued or modified after december  additionally  certain disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements ending after december  the disclosures required of us by fin in its fiscal consolidated financial statements are in note we do not believe that the adoption of this interpretation in will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our long term debt agreement 
our long term debt bears interest at variable rates that are tied to either the us prime rate or libor at the time of the borrowing 
we maintain portions of our debt in libor tranches that mature in one to nine months 
as those tranches mature  the interest rates on our outstanding borrowings are changed to reflect current prime or libor rates 
therefore  our interest expense changes as the prime or libor market rates change 
we have entered into two interest rate swap instruments  designated as cash flow hedges  as shown in the following table date entered into rate paid rate received notional amount fair value at june  mo 
us libor   december  mo 
us libor   based on our overall interest rate exposure at february   a hypothetical instantaneous increase or decrease of one percentage point in interest rates applied to borrowings under our revolving credit facility would change our after tax earnings by approximately million over a month period 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates is limited because we do not operate any stores outside of the united states 
we do not consider the market risk exposure relating to foreign currency exchange to be material 
foreign currency fluctuations did not have a material impact on us during the quarter or year to date periods in fiscal  or the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities at february  was  the fair value of these investments will fluctuate as the quoted market prices of such securities fluctuate 
as of february   the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities was  less than the adjusted basis of those investments 
during fiscal  we recorded a realized loss of approximately  due to a writedown of our marketable securities as a result of an other than temporary decline in the value of the securities 
approximately  of unrealized holding losses  net of tax arose  after the adjustment for the realized loss included in income before taxes 
the remaining unrealized holding loss has not been recognized in our consolidated statement of operations  but rather has been recorded as a component of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income loss 
the actual gain or loss that we will realize when these investments are sold will depend on the fair value of these securities at the time of sale 
based on our marketable equity securities portfolio and quoted market prices at february   a increase or decrease in the market price of such securities would result in an increase or decrease of approximately  in the fair value of the marketable equity securities portfolio 
although changes in quoted market prices may affect the fair value of the marketable equities securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold or determined to have a decline in value  which is other than temporary
