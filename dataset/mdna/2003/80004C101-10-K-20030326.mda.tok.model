item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in march  we introduced a smaller version of the sd card  known as minisd 
the minisd card includes the feature set of the standard sd card but is designed for mobile phones and other products requiring small form factors 

table of contents industry background in recent years  digital computing and processing have expanded beyond the boundaries of desktop computer systems to include a broader array of consumer electronic  industrial and communications products 
these new devices include digital cameras  advanced mobile phones that incorporate digital cameras  pdas  highly portable computers  portable digital music players  digital video recorders  wireless base stations  network computers  communication routers and switches  handheld data collection terminals  medical monitors and other electronic systems 
the storage requirements of these applications include small form factor size  high reliability  low power consumption and the capability to withstand high levels of shock and vibration and extreme temperature fluctuations 
because storage products based on flash semiconductor technology can meet these requirements  these devices and systems represent market opportunities for flash storage systems 
the sandisk solution our flash memory storage solution  known as system flash or data storage flash  addresses the needs of many emerging applications in the consumer electronics and industrial communications markets 
since our inception  we have been actively involved in all aspects of flash memory process development  chip design  controller development and system level integration  as well as the creation and promotion of new flash card industry standards  to ensure the creation of fully integrated  broadly interoperable products that are compatible with both existing and new system platforms 
we believe our core technical competencies are in high density flash memory process and design  controller design  system level integration  compact packaging and low cost system testing 
to achieve compatibility among various electronic platforms  regardless of the host processor or operating system used  we have developed new capabilities in flash memory chip design and created intelligent controllers 
we have also developed an architecture that can leverage advances in flash memory process technology to ensure a scaleable  high yield  cost effective and highly reliable manufacturing process 
our cf card  sd card  minisd card  multimediacard  memory stick pro  cruzer and flashdisk products are portable  have an on board controller and use file formats that are forward and backward compatible 
all of our flash data storage products can store almost any type of digital information  including voice  e mail  music  video clips and digital images 
our products offer the following features small form factor 
our cf card products weigh about half an ounce and are approximately the size of a matchbook 
our multimediacard and sd card products are approximately the size of a postage stamp and weigh less than two grams 
our newly announced minisd card has a length of mm  width of mm and thickness of mm 
our flashdisk cards are small and lightweight with a length of mm  width of mm  thickness of mm or mm and weight of less than ounces 
non volatility 
our products store information in non volatile memory cells that do not require power to retain information 
high degree of ruggedness 
our devices have an operating shock rating of  gs for cf cards and  gs for all other products equivalent to being able to withstand ten foot and eight foot drops onto concrete  respectively 
our products are also designed to tolerate extensive fluctuations in temperatures and humidity 
low power consumption 
during read and write operations  our products use less power than the rotating disk drives found in many portable computers 
at all other times during system operation  our products require virtually no power 
depending upon the end product making use of our flash data storage  this can translate into longer battery life 
high reliability 
our products utilize sophisticated error detection and correction algorithms and dynamic defect management techniques to provide high data reliability and endurance 

table of contents high performance 
we believe that the read and write data rates of our products meet or exceed the read and write data rates required today by the majority of consumer and industrial communications applications 
the flash process and flash memory chip designs developed by us in cooperation with our partners make our products scaleable over several generations of semiconductor fabrication processes 
this feature has allowed us to significantly reduce our cost per megabyte of capacity with each new generation of our products 
by maintaining the same basic design parameters  each generation of our flash memory products maintains full compatibility with prior generations 
this chip architecture has allowed us to significantly reduce cell size and thereby chip size 
this has allowed us to increase storage capacity and lower the cost of our flash memory products 
we have developed core competencies in low cost micropackaging technology as well as low cost batch testing  both of which are important elements in building high capacity  high reliability flash cards at a competitive cost and in high volumes 
applications and markets for flash data storage we target the consumer electronics and the industrial communications markets for our flash data storage products 
our products are used in a number of rapidly growing consumer electronics applications  such as digital cameras  pdas  portable digital music players  digital video recorders and mobile phones  as well as in industrial and communications applications  such as communications routers and switches and wireless communications base stations 
consumer electronics 
the increasing trend towards the use of digital technology in consumer electronics devices has created requirements for new data storage products 
for example  a number of major camera and imaging companies have introduced digital cameras that we believe will enable professionals and consumers to eliminate the need for standard mm photographic film by replacing it with re usable compact digital data storage devices 
in addition  flash data storage products  such as our removable cf card  sd card  mini sd card  smartmedia  flashdisk  multimediacard  memory stick  memory stick pro and ultra compactflash products and embedded flash chipset  nand flash components and flashdrive products are used in pdas  highly portable computers  digital audio players  network computers  video camcorders  cellular telephones  next generation mobile telephones that incorporate digital cameras and other devices 
industrial communications market 
the communications market has applications that require new types of data storage 
for example  communications switches and cellular base stations require data storage in environments that are subject to shock and vibration and a wide range of temperature and humidity conditions 
as the storage capacity of our cards grows  we are increasingly able to displace disk drives in routers and switches 
in the fiscal years ended december   and  product sales to our top customers accounted for approximately  and of our product revenues  respectively 
in  and  no single customer accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
we have also experienced significant changes in the composition of our major customer base from year to year and expect this pattern to continue as certain customers increase or decrease their purchases of our products as a result of fluctuations in market demand for their products 
sales to our customers are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders rather than long term contracts 
the loss of  or significant reduction in  purchases by any of our major customers  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations

our personal tag  or p tag  is a wearable  matchbook size  memory card that can be used to store critical data such as medical records and other personal information 
the target markets for these cards include military agencies  government departments  insurance and health care companies worldwide for healthcare and security applications 
the product evaluation process of these types of customers is lengthy 
we also believe that the current generation p tag may not provide sufficient security for stored data  and that to make it a more attractive product we will have to improve its on board security for data protection 
we have not to date generated meaningful revenue from p tag 
technology since our inception  we have focused our research  development and standardization efforts on developing highly reliable  high performance and cost effective flash memory storage products to address a variety of emerging market needs 
we have been actively involved in all aspects of this development  including flash memory process development  chip design  controller development and system level integration to ensure the creation of fully integrated  broadly interoperable products that are compatible with both existing and newly developed system platforms 
in  we entered into a long term strategic partnership with toshiba to jointly develop and manufacture advanced nand flash memory components to be used in our products 
we believe our core technical competencies are in high density flash memory process and design  controller design  system level integration  compact packaging and low cost system testing 
we have also initiated  defined and developed new standards such as cf card  multimediacard  sd card  minisd card  and memory stick pro cards to meet new market needs and to promote wide acceptance of the standards through interoperability and ease of use 
to achieve compatibility with various electronic platforms regardless of the host processors or operating systems used  we developed new capabilities in flash memory chip design and created intelligent controllers 
we also developed an architecture that can leverage advances in process technology to ensure a scaleable  high yielding  cost effective and highly reliable manufacturing process 
we believe that these technical competencies and our system design approach have enabled us to introduce flash data storage products that are better suited for our target markets than linear flash cards based on socket flash chips 
we design our products to be compatible with industry standard ide  ata  multimediacard  sd and memory stick interfaces used in all standard operating os systems such as windows and apple compatible personal computers  and operating systems used in cell phones  pdas  and other consumer and industrial products 
our patented intelligent controller with its advanced defect management system permits our products to achieve a high level of reliability and longevity 
latent bit failure can occur several years into the life of a flash card product and can be difficult to detect with traditional flash technology 
our system allows the automatic 
table of contents substitution of major blocks of the memory chip in case of any latent flash memory failures 
additionally  our controller generates an error correcting code that is stored simultaneously with the data and is used to detect and dynamically correct any errors when the data is read 
this design permits our products to maintain error free operation for hundreds of thousands of erase and write cycles and reduces manufacturing costs by allowing us to incorporate partial die with less than of the physical bits on each chip into the products without loss of functionality 
strategic manufacturing relationships an important element of our strategy has been to establish strategic relationships with leading technology companies that can provide us with access to leading edge semiconductor manufacturing capacity and participate in the development of some of our products 
this enables us to concentrate our resources on the product design and development areas where we believe we have competitive advantages 
we have developed strategic relationships with united microelectronics  inc  or umc  in taiwan  tower semiconductor ltd  or tower  in israel  hitachi  ltd  or hitachi  in japan and toshiba with whom we have both a joint venture  flashvision  which manufactures nand flash memory  and a foundry relationship with toshiba s yokkaichi semiconductor fabrication facility 
in august  we entered into a seven year supply agreement with samsung electronics co  ltd  or samsung  which allows us to purchase nand flash memory products from samsung s fabrication facilities in south korea 
we may establish relationships with other foundries in the future 
all of our flash memory card products require silicon wafers  a substantial majority of which are currently supplied by toshiba s wafer facility in yokkaichi  japan  and to a lesser extent by hitachi and samsung 
all of our memory wafers are currently manufactured using nand process technology primarily in and micron feature sizes 
umc currently manufactures our controller wafers  and we expect tower to commence production of some of our controller designs in the second half of in the past  we have experienced periods of supply constraints or excesses  each of which can have a significant impact on our gross margins and supplier relationships 
if any of our suppliers are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy these requirements  our business  financial condition and operating results could suffer 
in april  we and toshiba entered into a series of agreements under which we and toshiba restructured our flashvision dominion semiconductor  virginia business by consolidating flashvision s advanced nand wafer fabrication manufacturing operations at toshiba s memory fabrication facility in yokkaichi  japan 
under the terms of the agreement  toshiba has transferred the flashvision owned and leased nand production tool set from dominion to yokkaichi and has undertaken full responsibility for the equipment transfer and production set up 
the flashvision operation at yokkaichi continues the joint venture on essentially the same terms as the parties had at dominion 
in march  flashvision exercised its right of early termination under its lease facility with abn amro bank  nv  or abn amro  and in april repaid all amounts outstanding 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources and factors that may affect future results risks related to our flashvision joint venture we have contingent indemnification obligations 



under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with flashvision  hitachi  samsung  toshiba  tower and umc  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments 
the estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase of flashvision s wafer production 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results risks related to vendors and subcontractors our obligation to provide a six month rolling forecast 



in july  we entered into a share purchase agreement to make a million investment in tower semiconductor  ltd  or tower  in israel 
the investment guarantees us a portion of the available wafer capacity at the new advanced wafer fabrication facility being built by tower  fab  with strategic pricing terms 
the investment was payable in five installments  each of which was subject to the completion of certain 
table of contents milestones  four of which were paid in and fab is currently in its production startup phase and has been financed  in part  by a credit facility agreement that requires tower to satisfy certain financial covenants and comply with certain conditions 
if tower is unable to satisfy these financial covenants or comply with these conditions  and therefore  is not able to obtain additional bank financing  or its current bank obligations are accelerated  or it fails to secure customers for its foundry capacity to help offset its fixed costs  such failure could jeopardize the completion of fab and tower s ability to continue operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results risks related to our investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
we believe additional foundry capacity will be necessary to meet future demand for our products 
our ability to increase our revenues and net income in future periods is dependent on establishing additional wafer supply relationships and on receiving an uninterrupted supply of wafers from our manufacturing partners 
our reliance on third party wafer manufacturers involves several material risks  including shortages of manufacturing capacity  reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  production yields and costs 
this reliance could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  as a result of our dependence on foreign wafer manufacturers  we are subject to the risks of conducting business internationally  including political risks and exchange rate fluctuations 
assembly and testing we test our wafers at toshiba in yokkaichi  japan  and united test center  inc in taiwan 
substantially all of the tested wafers are then shipped to our third party memory assembly subcontractors  silicon precision industries co  ltd 
in taiwan and mitsui co  ltd 
in japan 
a substantial portion of our packaged memory final test  card assembly and card test is performed at silicon precision industries and united test center  inc in taiwan  and celestica  inc 
and flextronics in china 
during fiscal  these subcontractors will continue to assemble and test the vast majority of our products 
we believe our use of subcontractors reduces the cost of our operations and gives us access to increased production capacity 
any significant problems that occur at our subcontractors  or their failure to perform at the level we expect  could result in a disruption of production and a shortage of products to meet customer demand 
our customers have demanding requirements for quality and reliability 
to maximize quality and reliability  we monitor electrical and inspection data from our wafer foundries and assembly and test subcontractors 
we monitor wafer foundry production for consistent overall quality  reliability  yield and defect levels 
most of our major component suppliers and subcontractors are iso or certified 
research and development we believe that our future success will depend on the continued development and introduction of new generations of flash memory chips  controllers and products designed specifically for the flash data storage market 
in fiscal  the majority of our production output shifted from the megabit  micron nor mlc technology to the megabit  micron nand flash memory supplied by flashvision llc  our joint venture with toshiba 
in december  we received the first production output of the next generation of megabit  micron nand mlc flash memory 
late in  we began production of certain nand flash memory chips employing micron process feature size through our joint venture with toshiba at the yokkaichi fabrication facility 
we do not expect the micron nand flash memory wafers to contribute substantially to revenues until the second half of our research and development expenses were million  million and million  for the fiscal years ended december    and  respectively 
as of december   we had full time equivalent employees engaged in research and development activities  including in our israel design center  in our scotland design center and located in japan in support of our nand flash memory research  development and manufacturing 
in fiscal and beyond  we expect to significantly increase our spending on process and design research and development to support the development and introduction of new 
table of contents generations of flash data storage products  including our gigabit and gigabit nand mlc flash memory chips employing micron process feature sizes

we believe that tailoring the technical support level to our customers needs is essential 
table of contents for the success of product introductions and to achieve a high level of satisfaction among our customers 
we generally provide a one year warranty on our products 
patents and licenses we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we vigorously protect and defend our intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been involved in significant disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and we believe we may be involved in similar disputes in the future 
in  we developed the concept of emulation of a hard disk drive with flash solid state memory 
the first related patents were filed in by dr 
eli harari and exclusively licensed to us 
as of december   we own or have exclusive rights to united states and foreign issued patents  and patent applications pending in the united states  as well as pending in foreign patent offices 
we intend to seek additional international and united states patents on our technology 
we believe some of our patents are fundamental to the implementation of flash data storage systems  as well as the implementation of mlc flash  independent of the flash technology used 
however  we cannot assure you that any patents held by us will not be invalidated  that patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be of sufficient scope or strength or be issued in the primary countries where our products can be sold to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
additionally  our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which has resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
to preserve our intellectual property rights  we believe it may be necessary to initiate litigation against one or more third parties  including but not limited to those we have already notified of possible patent infringement 
in addition  one or more of these parties may bring suit against us 
see item legal proceedings 
from time to time  we have been contacted by various other parties who have alleged that certain of our products infringe on patents that these parties claim to hold 
to date  no legal actions have been filed in connection with any such infringement  other than as discussed above 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
any litigation  whether as a plaintiff or as a defendant  would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation is ultimately determined in our favor 
in addition  the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
if we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or our products are found to infringe on the patents or intellectual property rights of others  we may be required to license such patents or intellectual property rights 
we may also need to license some or all of our patent portfolio to be able to obtain cross licenses to the patents of others 
we currently have patent cross license agreements with several companies including hitachi  intel  lexar  samsung  sharp  sst  smartdisk  tdk  sony  matsushita and toshiba 
from time to time  we have also entered into discussions with other companies regarding potential cross license agreements for our patents 
we cannot assure you that licenses will be offered or that the terms of any offered licenses will be acceptable to us 
if we obtain licenses from third parties  we may be required to pay license fees or make royalty payments  which could reduce our gross margins 
if we are unable to obtain a license from a third party for technology  we could incur substantial liabilities or be required to expend substantial resources redesigning our products to eliminate the infringement 
in addition  we might be required to suspend the manufacture of products or the use by our foundries of processes requiring the technology 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in redesigning our products or that we could obtain licenses under reasonable terms 
furthermore  any development or license negotiations could require substantial expenditures of time and other resources by us 

table of contents as is common in the industry  we agree to indemnify certain of our suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of such indemnity varies  but may in some instances include indemnification for damages and expenses  including attorneys fees 
we may from time to time be engaged in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations 
in our efforts to maintain the confidentiality and ownership of our trade secrets and other confidential information  we require all regular and temporary employees  consultants  foundry partners  certain customers  suppliers and partners to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencement of a relationship with us and extending for a period of time beyond termination of the relationship 
we cannot assure you that these agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information 
backlog we manufacture and market primarily standard products 
sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within the upcoming twelve months 
since orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellations  backlog is not necessarily an indication of future revenue 
as of december   our backlog was million  compared to million at december  this increase in backlog was primarily due to strong demand in the consumer  oem and industrial markets 
as of december   backlog associated with our retail channel increased by  compared to the same period in backlog in our oem channel increased as of december   as compared to related to higher demand than that experienced in in  sales to our oem customers represented of our product revenues  while oem sales represented of our product revenues in retail revenues  which are typically derived from sales booked and shipped in the same quarter  increased to of our product revenues from in we expect sales to the retail channel to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in competition we compete in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer foundry capacity  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers 
our primary competitors include companies that develop and manufacture storage flash chips  such as hitachi  samsung and toshiba 
in addition  we compete with companies that manufacture other forms of flash memory and companies that purchase flash memory components and assemble memory cards 
companies that manufacture socket flash  linear flash and components include advanced micro devices  atmel  fujitsu  intel  macronix  mitsubishi  sharp electronics and st microelectronics 
companies that combine controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards  or that resell flash cards under their brand label include dane elec manufacturing  delkin devices  inc  feiya technology corporation  fuji  hagiwara  hama  i o data  infineon  jessops  kingston technology  kodak  lexar media  m systems  matsushita battery  matsushita panasonic  memorex  micron technology  pny  pretec  pqi  silicon storage technology  silicon tek  simple technology  sony  tdk corporation  toshiba  and viking components and several other resellers primarily located in taiwan 
in  we along with matsushita and toshiba  formed the secure digital association  or sd association  to jointly develop and promote the secure digital card 
under this arrangement  royalty bearing secure digital card licenses are available to other flash memory card manufacturers  resulting in increased competition for our sd card and other products 
in addition  matsushita and toshiba sell secure digital cards that compete directly with our products 
while other flash card manufacturers are required to pay license fees and royalties  which will be shared among matsushita  toshiba and us  there are no royalties or license fees payable among the three companies for their respective sales of the secure digital card 
thus  we forfeit 
table of contents potential royalty income from secure digital card sales by matsushita and toshiba 
to date we have not received any meaningful royalties from any sd licensees 
in addition  we and toshiba each separately market and sell nand flash memory products developed and manufactured by our joint venture  flashvision 
accordingly  we compete directly with toshiba for sales of these products 
moreover  we rely principally on toshiba  and to a lesser extent samsung  for our nand flash memory supply 
we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several of our leading competitors including hitachi  intel  lexar  matsushita  sst  samsung  sharp  smartdisk  sony  tdk and toshiba 
under these agreements  each party may manufacture and sell products that incorporate technology covered by the other party s patent or patents related to flash memory devices 
as we continue to license our patents to certain of our competitors  competition will increase and may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  we are engaged in licensing discussions with several of our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in concluding licensing agreements under terms which are favorable to us  or at all 
competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that are different from our products including m systems diskonkey  a usb based memory device  and the secure multimediacard from hitachi and infineon and the xd picture card from fuji and olympus 
each competing standard may not be mechanically and electronically compatible with our products 
if a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs in one of these alternative competing standards  our products will be eliminated from use in that product 
in addition  other companies  such as sanyo  and matrix semiconductor have announced products or technologies that may potentially compete with our products 
the microdrive  which hitachi recently acquired from ibm  is a rotating disk drive in a type ii cf format  which competes directly with our larger capacity cf memory cards 
m systems diskonchip millennium product competes against our nand flash component products in embedded storage applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances 
sony has licensed its proprietary memory stick to us and other companies and sony has agreed to supply us a portion of its memory stick output for resale under our brand name 
in addition  we and sony have co developed and co own the specifications for the next generation memory stick  known as the memorystick pro 
each of us has all rights to manufacture and sell this new memory stick pro 
if consumer electronics products using the memory stick pro achieve widespread use  sales of our multimediacard  sd card  smartmedia card and cf card products may decline 
our multimediacard products also have faced significant competition from toshiba s smartmedia flash cards 
we also face competition from products based on mlc flash technology from intel and hitachi 
these products currently compete with our nand mlc products 
mlc flash is a technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of information instead of the traditional single bit stored by conventional flash technology 
in addition  infineon has recently formed a separate business unit  called infineon flash  that was formed to develop and commercialize a new flash technology called nrom  which offers bits per cell and is claimed to match the density of our nand mlc 
infineon has also stated its intention to utilize this nrom flash memory technology  once it reaches production  in a line of flash cards that will compete with our cards  including our multimediacard and sd card 
moreover  each of micron technology  inc  hynix semiconductor inc  and stmicroelectronics  have stated their intention to compete with nand flash memory with their own flash products 
if any of these competitors is successful  this new competition could adversely impact our future sales 
furthermore  we expect to face competition both from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets that have similar or alternative data storage solutions  which may be less costly or provide additional features 
price is an important competitive factor in the market for consumer products 
increased price competition could lower gross margins if our average selling prices decrease faster than our costs and could also result in lost sales 

table of contents we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including price  quality  and on time delivery to our customers  product performance  availability and differentiation  success in developing new applications and new market segments for system flash technology  adequate foundry capacity  efficiency of production  timing of new product announcements or introductions by us  our customers and our competitors  the ability of our competitors to incorporate their flash data storage systems into their customers products  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  successful protection of intellectual property rights  and general market and economic conditions 
we believe that we compete well with other companies with respect to these factors 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
employees as of december   we had full time employees and temporary employees  including in research and development  in sales and marketing  in general and administration and in operations 
our success is dependent upon our retention of key technical  sales and marketing employees and members of senior management

we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statements to reflect any event or circumstance that may arise after the date of this report 
overview sandisk was founded in to develop and market flash data storage systems 
we sell our products to the consumer electronics and industrial communications markets 
in fiscal  approximately of our product sales were attributable to the consumer electronics market  particularly sales of compactflash  or cf card  secure digital  or sd card  memory stick and smartmedia card products for use in digital camera applications 
our cf card products have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity flashdisk and flashdrive products 
in addition  a substantial portion of our products are sold into the retail channel  which usually has shorter customer order lead times than our other channels 
a majority of our sales to the retail channel are turns business  with orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter  thereby decreasing our ability to accurately forecast future production needs and sales levels 
we believe sales to the consumer market will continue to represent a substantial majority of our sales  and may increase as a percentage of sales in future years  as the popularity of consumer applications with flash memory  including digital cameras  mobile phones and mobile phones that incorporate digital cameras and pdas  increases 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the volume of product sales  competitive pricing pressures  availability of foundry capacity  variations in manufacturing cycle times  fluctuations in manufacturing yields and manufacturing capacity utilization  the timing of significant orders  our ability to match supply with demand  changes in product and customer mix  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the channels through which our products are distributed  timing of new product announcements and introductions by us and our competitors  the timing of license and royalty revenues  fluctuations in product costs  increased research and development expenses  and exchange rate fluctuations 
we have experienced seasonality in the past 
as the proportion of our products sold for use in consumer electronics applications increases  our revenues may become increasingly subject to seasonal increases in the fourth quarter of each year and declines in the first quarter of the following year 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly 



and risks related to sales of our products there is seasonality in our business 



beginning in late  we adopted a strategy of licensing our flash technology  including our patent portfolio  to third party manufacturers of flash products 
to date  we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several companies  and intend to pursue opportunities to enter into additional licenses 
under our current license agreements  licensees pay license fees  royalties  or a combination thereof 
in some cases  the compensation to us may be partially in the form of guaranteed access to flash memory manufacturing capacity from the licensee company 
the timing and amount of royalty payments and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and  in some cases  the timing of sales of products by the other parties 
as a result  license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues  gross margins and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues 
we market our products using a direct sales organization  distributors  manufacturers representatives  private label partners  oems and retailers 
in  and  retail sales accounted for  and 
table of contents of total product revenues  respectively 
we expect that sales through the retail channel will comprise an increasing share of our product revenues in the future  and that a substantial portion of our sales into the retail channel will be made to customers that will have the right to return unsold products 
our policy is to defer recognition of revenues from these sales until the products are sold to the end customers 
in  sales to the oem and industrial channels accounted for of total product revenues  compared to in and in however  total revenue dollars from our oem and industrial channels increased in  compared to historically  a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers 
sales to our top customers accounted for approximately  and  of our product revenues for   and  respectively 
in  and  no single customer accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
we expect that sales of our products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our product revenues for the foreseeable future 
we have also experienced significant changes in the composition of our customer base from year to year and expect this pattern to continue as market demand for our customers products fluctuates 
the loss of  or a significant reduction in purchases by any of our major customers  could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to sales of our products sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues 



all of our flash memory products require silicon wafers  a substantial majority of which is currently manufactured for us by toshiba corporation s  or toshiba  wafer facility in yokkaichi  japan  under our joint venture agreement 
additionally  in august  we entered into a seven year supply agreement with samsung electronics co  ltd  or samsung  which allows us to purchase nand flash memory products from samsung s fabrication facilities in south korea 
industry wide demand for semiconductors decreased significantly in  due to decreased demand in the cellular phone markets and the broad  general economic downturn leading to a us recession 
semiconductor manufacturers  including some of our suppliers and competitors  added new advanced wafer fabrication capacity prior to the downturn 
this additional capacity  along with slowing economic conditions  resulted in excess supply and led to intense pricing pressure 
due to the oversupply of flash memory foundry capacity throughout and the economic slowdown in  the decline in our average selling price per megabyte of in compared to was much more severe than the decrease we experienced in compared to in the fourth quarter of  the average sales price per megabyte we sold decreased by compared to the fourth quarter of this decline in far exceeded our ability to reduce our cost per megabyte 
consequently we saw a dramatic reduction in our product gross margins  which resulted in substantial operating losses in in  due to competitive pricing pressures  our average selling price per megabyte declined by approximately when compared to in the fourth quarter of  the average sales price per megabyte we sold decreased by  compared to the fourth quarter of if industry wide demand for our products for prolonged periods is below the industry wide available supply  our product prices could decrease faster than our ability to reduce costs resulting in operating losses in the future 
under our wafer supply agreements with toshiba  flashvision  samsung  tower semiconductor ltd  or tower  and umc  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments 
the estimates for the remaining three months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase of all of flashvision s wafer production 
this limits our ability to react to significant fluctuations in demand for our products 
if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders  we may end up with excess inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
conversely  if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and flash memory products to fill customer orders  which could result in lost sales and lower revenues 
if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers or flash memory products with acceptable prices and or yields from any foundry  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we have from time to time taken write downs for excess or obsolete inventories and lower of cost or market price adjustments 
in for example  such write downs and lower of cost or market adjustments 
table of contents were approximately million 
we may be forced to take additional write downs for excess or obsolete inventory in future quarters if market demand for our products deteriorates and our inventory levels exceed customer orders 
in addition  we may record additional lower of cost or market price adjustments to our inventories if pricing pressure results in a net realizable value that is lower than our cost 
although we continuously try to align our inventory quantities with the current level of business  we are obligated to honor existing purchase orders  which we have placed with our suppliers 
in the case of flashvision  both we and toshiba are obligated to purchase our half of the production output  which makes it more difficult for us to reduce our inventory during an industry downturn 
excess inventory not only ties up our cash  but also can result in substantial losses if such inventory  or large portions thereof  has to be written down due to lower market pricing or product obsolescence 
these inventory adjustments decrease gross margins and in resulted in  and could in the future result in  fluctuations in gross margins and net earnings in the quarter in which they occur 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly 



export sales are an important part of our business  representing   and of our total revenues in   and  respectively 
our sales may be impacted by changes in economic conditions in our international markets 
economic conditions in our international markets  including japan  asia and the european union  may adversely affect our revenues to the extent that demand for our products in these regions declines 
while most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  we invoice certain japanese customers in japanese yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions  which could affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our international operations  threats of war  and changes in securities laws and regulations because of our international operations  we must comply with numerous laws and regulations 



for the foreseeable future  we expect to realize a significant portion of our revenues from recently introduced and new products 
typically  new products initially have lower gross margins than more mature products because the manufacturing yields are lower at the start of manufacturing each successive product generation 
in addition  manufacturing yields are generally lower at the start of manufacturing any product at a new foundry 
in and  we experienced start up costs of approximately million and million  respectively  associated with ramping up nand wafer production at flashvision 
during the start up phase  the fabrication equipment and operating expenses are applied to a relatively small output of production wafers  making this output very expensive 
in the next two to three years  we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity at flashvision 
we expect to fund up to approximately million for the initial fabrication capacity expansion in such increases in fabrication capacity are expected to cause us to periodically experience startup costs of a material nature 
to remain competitive  we are focusing on a number of programs to lower manufacturing costs  including development of future generations of nand flash memory 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop such products or processes or that development of such processes will lower manufacturing costs 
if the current industry wide and worldwide economic slowdown continues throughout fiscal  we may be unable to efficiently utilize the nand flash wafer production from flashvision  which would force us to amortize the fixed costs of the fabrication facility over a reduced wafer output  making these wafers significantly more expensive 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to vendors and subcontractors we and our manufacturing partners must achieve acceptable manufacturing yields 



critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those 
table of contents related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition  sales returns and allowances and sales incentive programs 
we recognize net revenues when the earnings process is complete  as evidenced by an agreement with the customer  transfer of title and acceptance  if applicable  fixed pricing and reasonable assurance of collectibility 
because of frequent sales price reductions and rapid technology obsolescence in the industry  sales made to distributors and retailers under agreements allowing price protection and or right of return are deferred until the retailers or distributors sell the merchandise to the end customer  or the rights of return expire 
at december  and  deferred income  net of related costs  from sales to distributors and retailers was million and million  respectively 
estimated product returns are provided for and were not material for any period presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we earn patent license and royalty revenue under patent cross license agreements with several companies including hitachi ltd  or hitachi  lexar media  inc  or lexar  samsung  sharp electronics corporation  or sharp  silicon storage technology  inc  or sst  smartdisk corporation  sony corporation  or sony  and tdk 
our current license agreements provide for the payment of license fees  royalties  or a combination thereof  to us 
the timing and amount of these payments can vary substantially from quarter to quarter  depending on the terms of each agreement and  in some cases  the timing of sales of products by the other parties 
patent license and royalty revenue is recognized when earned 
in  and  we received payments under these cross license agreements  portions of which were recognized as revenue and portions of which are deferred revenue 
we receive royalty revenue reports from certain of our licensees and record all revenues one quarter in arrears 
our cross license arrangements  that include a guaranteed access to flash memory supply  were recorded based upon the cash received for the arrangement as we do not have vendor specific objective evidence for the fair value of the intellectual property exchanged or supply guarantees received 
under these arrangements we have recorded the cash received as the total value of goods received and are amortizing the amounts over the life of the agreement  which corresponds to the life of the supply arrangement as well 
recognition of deferred revenue is expected to occur in future periods over the life of the agreements  as we meet certain obligations as provided in the various agreements 
at december  and  deferred revenue from patent license agreements was million and million  respectively 
the cost of revenues associated with patent license and royalty revenues are insignificant 
we record reductions to revenue and trade accounts receivable for customer programs and incentive offerings including promotions and other volume based incentives when revenue is recorded 
marketing development programs  when granted  are either recorded as a reduction to revenue or as an addition to marketing expense depending on the contractual nature of the program and whether the conditions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  have been met 
these incentives generally apply only to our retail customers  which represented  and of our product revenues in  and  respectively 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings to our retail customers  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due based on our historical experience 
if circumstances change ie  
table of contents higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
warranty costs 
our products are warrantied for one to seven years 
a provision for the estimated future cost related to warranty expense is recorded and included in the cost of revenue when revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and repair or replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  or repair or replacement costs differ from our estimates  increases to our warranty liability would be required 
valuation of financial instruments 
our short term investments include investments in marketable equity and debt securities 
we also have equity investments in  umc of million and tower of million  as of december  in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost of these investments is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples  and other key measures for our investments in marketable equity securities and debt instruments 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
in  the market value of our investment in tower declined significantly therefore  we recognized losses totaling million related to the other than temporary decline of our equity investment  and an adjustment to the fair value of warrants purchased during of million as determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
in  the market value of our investment in umc and tower declined 
the declines were deemed to be other than temporary and losses totaling million were recognized 
if the fair value of the tower and umc investments decline further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
see note in the consolidated financial statements 
inventories and inventory valuation 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions  including assumptions about changes in average selling prices 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax assets 
based on the weight of available evidence  we provided a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was based on our assessment of our historical earnings patterns that make it uncertain that we will have sufficient income in the appropriate jurisdictions to realize the full value of the assets 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
the valuation allowance increased by million and million in and  respectively 
we had no valuation allowance at december  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets includes approximately million attributable to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to stockholders equity upon realization 
results of operations we operate in one business segment  flash memory products 
our products are sold throughout the world 
in the united states and foreign countries our products are sold through direct  oem  reseller  and distributor channels 
our chief decision maker  our president and chief executive officer  evaluates our performance based on total results 
revenue is evaluated based on geographic region and product category 
separate financial information is not available by product category in regards to asset allocation  expense allocation  or profitability 
product revenues 
in  our product revenues were million  up million or from million in the increase in product revenues was primarily due to a increase in unit sales  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices per unit 
in fiscal  the largest unit volume and revenue increases came from our cf card  sd card  memory stick  and flashdisk products  compared to the prior year 
in  total flash memory units sold increased approximately compared to in  due to competitive pricing pressures  our average selling price per megabyte declined by approximately 
table of contents when compared to in the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  our average selling prices per megabyte declined 
in  our product revenues were million  a decrease of from million in the decrease was primarily due to the downturn in the worldwide economy  industry wide excess supply of flash memory  and reduced demand from oem customers who were liquidating existing inventories throughout most of all of these factors reduced the demand for our products and resulted in intense pricing pressures causing the average selling price of our products to decline significantly 
in  the largest decline in revenues came from multimediacards  due to the slowdown in the market for digital music players and compactflash  due to the decline in average selling price 
in  our flash memory product unit sales declined and our average selling price per megabyte of flash memory shipped declined compared to due to the oversupply of flash memory foundry capacity throughout and the economic slow down in  the decline in our average selling price per megabyte of was much more severe than the decrease we experienced in our backlog as of december  was million  compared to million in this increase in backlog was primarily due to higher bookings in the consumer  oem and industrial markets 
as of december   backlog associated with our retail channel increased by  compared to the same period in backlog in our oem channel increased by as of december   as compared to  due to higher demand than that experienced in since orders constituting our current backlog are subject to changes in delivery schedules or cancellations  backlog is not necessarily an indication of future revenue 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly 



and risks related to sales of our products there is seasonality in our business 



in  oem sales represented of our product revenues  compared to of our product revenues in and in retail revenues  which are typically booked and shipped in the same quarter  increased to of our product revenues from in and in we expect sales to the retail channel to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues in license and royalty revenues 
we currently earn patent license fees and royalties under several cross license agreements  including agreements with hitachi  lexar  sharp  samsung  sony  sst  and tdk 
license and royalty revenues from patent cross license agreements were million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in license and royalty revenues between and were primarily due to lower patent royalties from lower royalty bearing sales by some of our licensees resulting in decreased patent license revenues recognized 
the higher license and royalty revenues in compared to were primarily due to increased sales by certain of our licensees in  and million of revenue recognized in conjunction with the settlement of the lexar litigation in revenues from licenses and royalties were of total revenues in  and in both and our income from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of this income comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees 
gross profits losses 
in fiscal  gross profits were million  or of total revenues compared to negative million  or negative of total revenues in and positive million  or of total revenues in product gross margins were in compared to a negative in  and positive in the increase in product gross margin and gross profits in was due to a combination of factors  including more stable pricing conditions in than in  lower production costs due to a higher mix of more cost effective multi level cell  or mlc  chips  significantly lower overhead expenses due to our restructuring activities in and improved economies of scale due to the growth in unit volumes across our major product lines 
in addition  we sold approximately million worth of nor inventory that had been fully written off as excess or obsolete in previous years 
the decline in gross margins in compared to was primarily due to lower sales volume  severely reduced average selling prices  inventory write downs of approximately million and start up costs associated with our flashvision foundry joint venture of approximately million 

table of contents research and development 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and payroll related expenses for design and development engineers  prototype supplies and contract services 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in  and million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses were in  in and in in  the absolute dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and payroll related expenses associated with increased personnel 
in  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in project related expenses 
the additional project expenses in were to support the development of new generations of nand flash data storage products 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods to support the development and introduction of new generations of flash data storage products  including our development efforts at our joint venture with toshiba  our co development agreement with sony and our continual development of advanced controller chips 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  sales commissions  benefits and travel expenses for our sales  marketing  customer service and applications engineering personnel 
these expenses also include other selling and marketing expenses such as independent manufacturer s representative commissions  advertising and tradeshow expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in in  the decrease was due primarily to decreased co op advertising expenses of million  which as of the beginning of fiscal are offset against revenue per applicable accounting literature  partially offset by an increase in commissions of million related to higher product revenues 
if we had been required to retroactively apply the same accounting treatment of recording these co op advertising expenses as offsets to revenue per new accounting literature prior to our fiscal year  we estimate that selling and marketing expenses would have been reduced by approximately million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease of million in commission expenses due to lower product revenues  a decrease in marketing expenses of million and a reduction of million in travel expenses 
sales and marketing expenses represented of total revenues in compared to in and in we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as sales of our products grow and as we continue to develop the retail channel and brand awareness for our products 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses include the cost of our finance  information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  legal and other administrative functions 
general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the increase in was due primarily to an increase in legal fees of million  increased payroll related expenses of million and an increase of million in allowance for doubtful accounts associated with higher trade accounts receivable balances from increased revenues 
the decrease in was primarily due to a decrease of million in legal fees  a reduction of million in the allowance for doubtful accounts related to lower accounts receivable balances and a decrease of million in salaries and related expenses associated with reduced headcount 
general and administrative expenses represented of total revenues in and compared to in general and administrative expenses could increase in the future if we pursue litigation to defend our patent portfolio and grow our infrastructure to support our growth 
see factors that may affect future results risks related to our intellectual property we may be unable to license intellectual property to or from third parties 



restructuring charges 
in the third quarter of  we adopted a plan to transfer all of our card assembly and test manufacturing operations from our sunnyvale location to offshore subcontractors 
as a result we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the third quarter of the charge included million of severance and employee related costs for a reduction in workforce of approximately personnel  equipment write off charges of million and lease commitments of million on a vacated warehouse facility 
as a part of our plan to transfer all card assembly and test manufacturing operations to offshore subcontractors  we abandoned excess equipment and recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal as of january  we have subleased a portion of our warehouse building in san jose  california 
given the current real estate market conditions in the san jose area  we do not expect to be able to sublease the 
table of contents remainder of this building before the end of any sublease income will be offset against the balance of the lease commitment restructuring charge recorded in the third quarter of of the million restructuring charge  cash payments of million and million were paid in and respectively 
after writing off certain non cash charges related to abandoned excess equipment  accruals of million remain as of december   related to amounts to be paid out for excess facility lease charges  net of facility sub lease income  over the respective lease terms 
the following table summarizes our restructuring activities from the inception of our plan through the end of workforce lease equipment reduction commitments total in thousands restructuring charge non cash charges cash payments accrual balance  december  non cash charges adjustments cash payments accrual balance  december  equity in income of joint venture 
in and  equity in income of joint ventures of million and million included our share of net income from our flashvision joint venture and losses from our digital portal inc  or dpi  joint venture 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of losses were deducted from our dpi investment account and therefore  as of december  there is no value related to dpi on our consolidated balance sheet 
in september  we agreed to sell a significant portion of our dpi shares to a nominee of photo me international  plc  or pmi  to reduce our ownership percentage below  and we gave up our seat on dpi s board of directors 
under the agreement  we discontinued our kiosk related activities  are no longer required to make additional equity investments in dpi  guarantee dpi s equipment leases or otherwise pay any of dpi s expenses and dpi will no longer use the sandisk brand name 
in future periods  we will account for our remaining investment in dpi on a cost basis 
interest income expense 
interest income was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in interest income in compared to was primarily due to reductions in market interest rates 
the decrease in interest income in compared to was also due to reductions in interest rates and as well as the funding of our strategic investments in tower and flashvision 
interest expense was million in on our convertible subordinated notes  or notes  issued in late and early in  we expect interest expense to be consistent and interest income to remain flat with an increase in cash balances offset by the additional impact of lower interest rates on our portfolio as existing securities mature and lower yielding securities are purchased 
loss on investment in foundries 
the market value of our investment in tower and related wafer credits has declined significantly over and due to the continuing semiconductor industry downturn 
as of december   we had invested million in tower and obtained  ordinary tower shares  million of prepaid wafer credits  and a warrant to purchase  ordinary tower shares at an exercise price of per share 
this warrant expires on october  at december   the value of our tower investment and wafer credits had declined to million 
losses totaling million  or million net of tax  were recorded in  comprised of a million related to the other than temporary decline of our equity investment  a million adjustment to the fair value of warrants purchased during as determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and a million write down in the value of wafer credits 
at december   the value of our tower investment and wafer credits had declined to million 
therefore  we recorded a loss of million  which included the write off of wafer 
table of contents credits received in in addition  we recorded a loss of million on our exchange of of our tower wafer credits for  ordinary tower shares at per share 
these losses totaled million  or million net of tax benefit in in both and  tower losses were recorded in loss on investment in foundry 
if the fair value of our tower investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
we periodically assess the value of the prepaid wafer credits for recoverability and write down the value as necessary 
in  we determined that our investment in umc had sustained a substantial decline in its value as defined by generally accepted accounting principles the value of our investment in umc had declined to million at december  we recorded a loss of million on our umc investment in  or million net of taxes 
at december   the market value of the available for sale portion of our umc investment had declined million  before tax  below its adjusted cost of million  and this unrealized loss of approximately million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet as this unrealized loss was deemed to be temporary 
if the fair value of our umc investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
in addition  in future periods  if our umc shares are sold  there may be a gain or loss  due to fluctuations in the market value of umc s stock 
gain loss on equity investment 
in we recognized an impairment charge on the decline in the value of our investment in divio  inc  or divio of million  or million net of tax  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
at december   the value of our divio investment had declined to million 
divio is currently unprofitable  and will require additional funding from external sources to complete the development and commercialization of its products 
given the current depressed conditions for financing private  venture capital backed startup companies  we cannot assure you that divio will be able to successfully finance its activities or continue its operations 
if they cannot do so  our investment in divio will be written down further or may even become worthless 
other income loss  net 
other income loss  net was a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in and income of  in the losses in and were primarily due to foreign currency transaction losses on our yen denominated assets 
other income in came primarily from foreign currency transaction gains 
provision for benefit from income taxes 
our effective tax provision rate was approximately  while our and effective tax rates were approximately and  respectively 
our tax rate is significantly lower than the statutory rate due to utilization of previously unbenefited net operating losses and a reduction of the valuation allowance due to the increase in the unrealized gain on our investment in umc 
our assessment of the amount of valuation allowance required will be influenced by the amount of unrealized tax gains on investments 
any increase in the mark to market value of the investments may result in the recognition of some portion of the valuation allowance 
this may cause the interim tax rate to fluctuate significantly 
due to our lack of visibility over the likelihood of generating future taxable income  we have not recognized a deferred tax asset in excess of the amount that will be available to offset our deferred tax liability 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows at december   we had working capital of million  which included million in cash and cash equivalents and million in unrestricted short term investments  excluding our investments in umc and tower 
operating activities for provided million of cash  primarily due to net income of million  a million decrease in income tax refund receivable  plus non cash charges  primarily depreciation of million  a decrease of million in our investment in flashvision  a million decrease in accounts 
table of contents payable  a million increase in deferred income on shipments to distributors and retailers and deferred revenue  and a million decrease in income taxes payable 
these were partially offset by increases of million in accounts receivable  million in inventory  and million in deferred taxes 
cash used by operations was million in  and cash provided by operations was million net cash used in investing activities was million in purchases net of proceeds from short term investments of million  million of capital equipment purchases and million invested in tower during fiscal were partially offset by a million return of capital received in the first quarter of  from flashvision llc net cash provided in investing activities was million in and net cash used of million in net cash provided by financing activities was million  which included the million net proceeds from the issuance of long term convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of  and million from the sale of common stock through our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
financing activities provided cash of million in and million in depending on the demand for our products  we may decide to make additional investments  which could be substantial  in assembly and test manufacturing equipment or wafer fabrication foundry capacity to support our business in the future 
we may also invest in or acquire other companies product lines or assets 
our operating expenses may increase as a result of the need to hire additional personnel to support our sales and marketing efforts and research and development activities  including our collaboration with toshiba for the joint development of nanometer and nanometer nand flash memory 
we plan to fund our short term operations from our current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
however  if our average product selling prices decline significantly  as they did in and  or demand for our products declines and we are required to purchase more wafers than we need due to our flashvison joint venture commitments  we may not be able to generate enough cash from our operations and will have to rely solely on our current cash and short term investment balances to fund our operating activities 
convertible subordinated notes on december   we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes due  or notes  and on january   the initial purchasers completed the exercise of their option to purchase an additional million of notes  for which we received net proceeds of approximately million 
based on the aggregate principal amount at maturity of million  the notes provide for semi annual interest payments of million each on may and november the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of the notes  subject to adjustment in certain events 
at anytime on or after november   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at a specified percentage of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
the debt issuance costs are being amortized over the term of the notes using the interest method 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligations under the notes 
investment in umc in january  the usic foundry was merged into the umc parent company 
in exchange for our usic shares  we received million umc shares 
these shares were valued at approximately million at the time of the merger  resulting in a pretax gain of million million after tax in the first quarter of all of the umc shares we received as a result of the merger in were subject to trading restrictions imposed by umc and the taiwan stock exchange 
as of december   the trading 
table of contents restrictions had expired on million shares 
the remaining million shares will become available for sale through january we also received million  million and million shares as stock dividends from umc in  and  respectively 
due to the decline in umc stock price from the weakness in the semiconductor industry  the value of our investment in umc had declined to million at december  therefore in  it was determined that the decline in the market value of the investment was other than temporary  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of million  or million net of taxes was recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards number the loss was included in loss on investment in foundry 
the umc shares received as stock dividends for the three years ending december  are included in the million shares classified as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
 are reported at a market value of million and included in current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also have million shares that contain trading restrictions that extend beyond one year  which are valued at their adjusted cost of million and included in non current assets 
umc s share price declined to nt at december  from a stock dividend adjusted price of nt at december  resulting in a million reduction in our previously recorded unrealized gain on the portion of our investment that is classified as available for sale 
at december   the market value of the available for sale portion of our umc investment had declined million  before tax  below its adjusted cost of million  and this unrealized loss of approximately million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet as this decline was deemed to temporary 
if the fair value of the umc investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
in addition  in future periods  there may be a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of umc stock or if umc shares are sold 
investment in flashvision joint venture on june   we closed a transaction with toshiba providing for the joint development and manufacture of megabit and gigabit flash memory chips and secure digital card controllers 
as part of this transaction  we and toshiba formed flashvision  a joint venture  to equip and operate a silicon wafer manufacturing line at toshiba s dominion semiconductor facility in manassas  virginia 
in january  we invested the final million of our million cash commitment in flashvision llc in april  we and toshiba entered into a series of agreements under which we restructured our flashvision joint venture by consolidating flashvision s advanced nand wafer fabrication manufacturing operations at toshiba s memory fabrication facility in yokkaichi  japan 
under the terms of the agreements  toshiba transferred the flashvision owned and leased nand production tool set from dominion to yokkaichi and undertook full responsibility for the equipment transfer and production set up 
the flashvision operation at yokkaichi continues the joint venture on essentially the same terms as the parties had at toshiba s facility in virginia 
in march  flashvision exercised its right of early termination under its lease facility with abn amro bank  nv and in april repaid all amounts outstanding 
flashvision secured a new equipment lease arrangement of approximately billion japanese yen or approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed in may with mizuho corporate bank  ltd  or mizuho  and certain other financial institutions 
under the terms of the new lease  toshiba is required to provide a guarantee to these financial institutions on behalf of flashvision 
we have agreed to indemnify toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
if flashvision fails to meet its lease commitments and toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of toshiba s guarantee  then we will be obligated to reimburse toshiba for of any claims under the lease  unless such claims result from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or its covenants to the lenders 
because flashvision s new equipment lease arrangement is denominated in japanese yen  the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
as of december   the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation  which reflects payments and any lease adjustments  was approximately million 
in the next two to three years  we expect to make substantial new investments in additional fabrication capacity at flashvision 
we expect to fund up to approximately million for the initial fabrication capacity expansion in 
table of contents investment in tower in july  we entered into a share purchase agreement to make a million investment in tower  for its new wafer foundry facility  fab during  tower satisfied the closing conditions of the share purchase agreement and completed the first two milestones 
under the terms of the agreement  we invested million to purchase  ordinary tower shares and obtained wafer credits of million 
in september  we agreed to convert of our wafer credits to equity at a price of per share and received an additional  ordinary tower shares 
due to the continued weakness in the semiconductor industry  the value of our tower investment and remaining wafer credits had declined to million at december  it was determined that this decline was other than temporary  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and a loss of million was recorded in the second half of in addition we recognized a loss of million on the exchange of of our tower wafer credits for  ordinary shares at per share 
these losses totaling million  or million net of tax benefit  were recorded in loss on foundry investment in in march  we amended our foundry investment agreements with tower by agreeing to advance the payments for the third and fourth milestones 
the payment for the third milestone of million was made on april  in exchange for this payment we received  ordinary shares and prepaid wafer credits of million 
the payment of million for the fourth milestone was paid on september  in exchange for this payment we received  ordinary shares of tower and million in prepaid wafer credits 
as of december   we had invested million in tower and obtained  ordinary shares  million of prepaid wafer credits  and warrants to purchase  ordinary shares at an exercise price of per share 
the investment in the ordinary shares represents an approximate equity ownership position in tower as of december  the wafer credits were applied to our pre paid wafer account and are to be applied against orders placed with tower s new wafer fabrication facility  fab  when and if completed  provided  however  that until july   the amounts added to the pre paid wafer account may only be applied towards a maximum of of our wafer purchases 
we periodically assess the value of our prepaid wafer credits considering the timing and quantity of our planned annual wafer purchases  the status of the foundry construction and general economic conditions 
if we determine that the value of these wafer credits is not recoverable  additional write downs will be recorded 
in  we recognized losses of million on the other than temporary decline in the value of our tower investment and the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and approximately million unrealized losses related to the fair value of the warrants purchased in october of our investment in tower was valued at million as of december  at december   our tower prepaid wafer credits were valued at million  net of million in write downs recorded in fiscal  related to the recoverability of these prepaid wafer credits 
in addition to our commitment under the share purchase agreement  we invested in tower s rights offering in october tower issued one right for each shares owned by record holders as of the record date 
in exercising our rights to participate  we paid approximately million in exchange for  ordinary tower shares and a warrant to purchase  ordinary shares at per share 
this warrant expires on october  during the fourth quarter of and in accordance with sfas  we recorded a write down in the fair value of these tower warrants of approximately million  as determined using a black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of these warrants will continue to fluctuate and additional adjustments to the warrant s fair value will be recorded in future periods 
in february  we agreed to further amend our foundry investment agreements with tower by agreeing to advance the payment for the fifth and final milestone 
this amendment is subject to approval by all required parties  including tower s shareholders 
if approved  the terms of the amendment require the payment of million for the advanced fifth milestone and this payment will be made in two installments 
the first installment of approximately million will be due five business days after the amendment is approved by all required parties  including tower s shareholders  the second installment of approximately million will be due five business days after tower has raised additional funds equal to approximately 
table of contents million  referred to as the minimum financing 
tower must complete the minimum financing prior to december   or we will not be obligated to pay the second installment 
each of the first and second installments will be paid provided tower meets these conditions  whether or not tower actually achieves its original fifth milestone obligation 
immediately following the advancement of the first installment  we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of tower equivalent to the first installment divided by the average trading price for ordinary shares of tower during the thirty consecutive trading days preceding the date the amendment was approved by tower s board of directors 
immediately following the advancement of the second installment  if it occurs  we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of tower equivalent to the second installment divided by the price per ordinary share of tower paid in connection with the minimum financing  or the minimum financing price  provided  however  that if the minimum financing price cannot reasonably be calculated from the documents evidencing the minimum financing  then the minimum financing price shall be deemed to be the average trading price for the ordinary shares of tower during the thirty consecutive trading days preceding the date the second installment is paid 
in addition  we will have the option to convert all or a portion of our unused pre paid wafers credits associated with the september fourth milestone payment into fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of tower based on the average closing price of ordinary shares of tower during the thirty consecutive trading days preceding december  tower s completion of fab is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the israeli government s investment center 
if tower is unable to obtain additional financing  complete foundry construction in a timely manner or successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced cmos process technologies  ramp up of production  and secure foundry customers sufficient to defray its fixed operating costs  the value of our investment in tower and wafer credits will decline significantly or possibly become worthless 
we would be unable to take advantage of our prepaid wafer credits and we may be unable to obtain a sufficient supply of wafers to manufacture our products  which would harm our business 
in addition  the value of our investment in tower may be adversely affected by a further deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally 
if the fair value of our tower investment declines further  it may be necessary to record additional losses  which potentially could amount to the remaining recorded value of our tower investment 
moreover  if tower is unable to satisfy certain financial covenants and comply with certain conditions as required by its credit facility agreement  and therefore is not able to obtain additional bank financing  or its current bank obligations are accelerated  such failure could jeopardize the completion of fab and tower s ability to continue operations 
other equity investments on august   we entered into a joint venture  dpi  with pmi for the manufacture  installation  marketing  and maintenance of self service  digital photo printing labs  or kiosks  bearing the sandisk brand name in locations in the us and canada 
under the agreement  we invested million 
in an agreement effective september   we and pmi agreed that we would scale down our kiosk activities and pmi would assume responsibility to finance and direct the future growth of dpi 
under the agreement  we converted approximately  in receivables due from dpi to equity in dpi  reduced our ownership percentage below and gave up our seat on the dpi board of directors 
under the new agreement  we discontinued our kiosk related activities  are no longer required to make additional equity investments in dpi  guarantee dpi s equipment leases or otherwise pay any of dpi s expenses  and furthermore  dpi will no longer use the sandisk brand name 
we have accounted for this investment under the equity method  and in we recorded a million loss as our share of dpi s losses which was deducted from the investment account and therefore  as of december   there is no value related to dpi on our consolidated balance sheet 
on november   we made a strategic investment of million in divio  inc  or divio 
divio is a privately held manufacturer of digital imaging compression technology and products for future digital camcorders that will be capable of using our flash memory cards to store home video movies  replacing the

factors that may affect future results risks related to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which may adversely affect our operating results and our stock price 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors  including the following unpredictable or declining demand for our products  decline in the average selling prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressures  seasonality in sales of our products  natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business  particularly japan  where our principal source of nand flash memory wafer capacity is located and taiwan  south korea  china and the united states  excess capacity of flash memory from our competitors and our own flash wafer capacity  which may cause a decline in our average selling prices  
table of contents difficulty of forecasting and managing inventory levels  particularly  building a large inventory of unsold product due to non cancelable contractual obligations to purchase materials such as flash wafers  controllers  printed circuit boards and discrete components  expenses related to obsolescence or devaluation of unsold inventory  writedowns of our equity investments and prepaid wafer credits  adverse changes in product and customer mix  slower than anticipated market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  such as the recently announced minisd card targeted at advanced mobile phones  increased sales by our competitors  competing flash memory card standards  which displace the standards used in our products  such as the new xd picture card format which is replacing our smartmedia card in new digital camera models from olympus and fuji  changes in our distribution channels  fluctuations in our license and royalty revenue  fluctuations in product costs  particularly due to fluctuations in manufacturing yields and utilization  availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity to meet customer demand  shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit boards required for the manufacturing of our products  significant yield losses  which could affect our ability to fulfill customer orders and could increase our costs  manufacturing flaws affecting the reliability  functionality or performance of our products  which could increase our product costs  reduce demand for our products or require product recalls  increased research and development expenses  exchange rate fluctuations  particularly the us dollar to japanese yen exchange rate  changes in general economic conditions  particularly in japan and the european union  and reduced sales to our retail customers if consumer confidence worsens due to declining economic conditions  war in iraq  the conflict in the korean peninsula or elsewhere  or due to terrorist acts 
difficulty of estimating future silicon wafer needs may cause us to overestimate our needs and build excess inventories  or underestimate our needs and have a shortage of silicon wafers  either of which will harm our financial results 
under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with flashvision  hitachi  samsung  toshiba and umc  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments 
the estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase of flashvision s wafer production 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
for example  if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders  we may end up with excess inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
conversely  if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and flash memory products to fill customer orders  which could result in dissatisfied customers  lost sales and lower revenues 
if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers or flash memory products with acceptable price and or yields from any foundry  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
because the majority of our cf card  sd card  memory stick  smartmedia card  and multimediacard products are sold into 
table of contents emerging consumer markets  it has been difficult to accurately forecast future sales 
in addition  bookings visibility remains low due to the current economic uncertainty in our markets 
a substantial majority of our quarterly sales are currently  and have historically been  from orders received and fulfilled in the same quarter  which makes accurate forecasting very difficult 
our product order backlog may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
variability of expense levels and significant fixed costs will harm our business if our revenues do not exceed our operating expenses 
we may need to hire additional personnel in certain business areas or otherwise increase our operating expenses in the future to support our sales and marketing efforts  research and development  and general and administrative activities 
we have significant fixed costs and we cannot readily reduce these expenses over the short term 
if our revenues do not increase proportionately to our operating expenses  or if revenues decrease or do not meet expectations for a particular period  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
license fees and royalties from our patent cross license agreements are variable and fluctuate from period to period making it difficult to predict our royalty revenues 
our intellectual property strategy consists of cross licensing our patents to other manufacturers of flash products 
under these arrangements  we earn license fees and royalties on individually negotiated terms 
our income from patent licenses and royalties can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
a substantial portion of this income comes from royalties based on the actual sales by our licensees 
the timing of revenue recognition from these payments is dependent on the terms of each contract and on the timing of product shipments by the third parties 
we align actual reported royalty revenues when reports are received during the second and fourth quarters of each fiscal year 
the timing and amount of royalty payments and the recognition of license fees can vary substantially from quarter to quarter depending on the terms of each agreement and  in some cases  the timing of sales of products by the other parties 
as a result  our license and royalty revenues have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
given the relatively high gross margins associated with license and royalty revenues  gross margins and net income are likely to fluctuate more with changes in license and royalty revenues than with changes in product revenues 
our license and royalty revenues may decline in the future as certain of our existing license agreements expire or our licensees reach their royalty payment caps 
we may be unable to maintain market share  which would reduce our potential revenues and benefit our competitors 
during periods of excess supply in the market for our flash memory products  such as we experienced in and the first quarter of  we may lose market share to competitors who aggressively lower their prices 
conversely  under conditions of tight flash memory supply  we may be unable to increase our production volumes at a sufficiently rapid rate so as to maintain our market share 
ultimately  our future growth rate depends on our ability to obtain sufficient flash memory wafers and other components to meet demand 
if we are unable to do so in a timely manner  we may lose market share to our competitors 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  severe price competition for our products  which adversely impacts our product gross margins and overall profitability 
in competing for market share we face large corporations that have well established brand identity and commanding strengths in our sales channels 
for example  sony is a competitor for the memory stick card  matsushita panasonic is a competitor for the sd card  and kodak and fuji are competitors for the cf and smartmedia cards 
future rapid growth may strain our operations 
despite actions we took in to align expense levels with decreased revenues  we must continue to hire  train  motivate and manage our employees to achieve future growth 
in the past  we have experienced difficulty hiring the necessary engineering  sales and marketing personnel to support our growth 
in addition  we must make a significant investment in our existing internal information management systems to support 
table of contents increased manufacturing  as well as accounting and other management related functions 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support rapid growth in the future  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends on key personnel  including our executive officers  the loss of whom could disrupt our business 
our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our senior management and other key research and development  sales  marketing and operations personnel  including dr 
eli harari  our founder  president and chief executive officer 
our success will also depend on our ability to recruit additional highly skilled personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining such key personnel  or that any of our key personnel will remain employed with us 
risks related to the development of new products in transitioning to new processes and products  we face production and market acceptance risks which have caused  and may in the future cause  significant product delays that could harm our business 
successive generations of our products have incorporated semiconductor devices with greater memory capacity per chip 
two important factors have enabled us to decrease the cost per megabyte of our flash data storage products the development of higher capacity semiconductor devices and the implementation of smaller geometry manufacturing processes 
a number of challenges exist in achieving a lower cost per megabyte  including lower yields often experienced in the early production of new semiconductor devices  manufacturing flaws with new processes including manufacturing processes at our subcontractors which may be extremely complex  problems with design and manufacturing of products that will incorporate these devices  which may result in delays or product recalls  and production delays 
because our products are complex  we periodically experience significant delays in the development and volume production ramp up of our products 
similar delays could occur in the future and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we along with our strategic wafer partner will successfully develop and bring into full production with acceptable yields and reliability these new products or the underlying technology  or that any development or production ramp will be completed in a timely or cost effective manner 
if we are not successful or if our cost structure is not competitive  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
new products based on nand mlc flash technology may encounter production delays and problems impacting production reliability and yields  which may cause our revenues and gross margins to decline 
we have developed new products based on nand mlc flash technology  a flash architecture designed to store two bits in each flash memory cell 
high density flash memory  such as nand mlc flash  is a complex technology that requires strict manufacturing controls and effective test screens 
problems encountered in the shift to volume production for new flash products could impact both reliability and yields  and result in increased manufacturing costs and reduced product availability 
we may not be able to manufacture future generations of nand mlc products with yields sufficient to result in lower costs per megabyte 
if we are unable to bring future generations of high density flash memory into full production as quickly as planned or if we experience unplanned yield or reliability problems  our revenues and gross margins will decline 

table of contents we continually seek to develop new products and standards  which may not be widely adopted by consumers or  if adopted  may reduce demand by consumers for our older products  which if not offset by increased demand for the new products could harm our results of operations 
we continually seek to develop new products and standards and enhance existing products and standards developed solely by us  as well as jointly with our strategic partners such as toshiba  matsushita and sony 
for example  in march  our joint development efforts with toshiba and matsushita  together with contribution by the sd association  resulted in the introduction of the minisd card  a smaller version of the sd card 
in addition  we and sony have co developed and co own the specifications for the next generation memory stick  the memory stick pro  which each of us has the right to manufacture and sell 
as we introduce new standards and new products  such as the minisd card and the memory stick pro  it will take time for these new standards and products to be adopted  for consumers to accept and transition to these new products and for significant sales to be generated therefrom  if this happens at all 
moreover  broad acceptance of new standards or products by consumers may reduce demand for our older products 
if this decreased demand is not offset by increased demand for our new products  our results of operations could be harmed 
we cannot assure you that any new products or standards we develop will achieve commercial success 
see the success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products 
the success of our business depends on emerging markets and new products 
in order for demand for our products to grow  the markets for new devices that use our flash memory products  such as digital cameras  portable digital music players and cellular phones must develop and grow 
if sales of these products do not grow  our revenues and profit margins could be adversely impacted 
the success of our new product strategy will depend upon  among other things  the following our ability to successfully develop new products with higher memory capacities and enhanced features at a lower cost per megabyte  the development of new applications or markets for our flash data storage products  the extent to which prospective customers design our products into their products and successfully introduce their products  the extent to which our products or technologies become obsolete or noncompetitive due to products or technologies developed by others  and the adoption by the major content providers of the copy protection features offered by our sd card products 
risks related to our flashvision joint venture our flashvision joint venture with toshiba makes us vulnerable to certain risks  including potential inventory write offs  disruptions or shortages of supply  limited ability to react to fluctuations in product demand  direct competition with toshiba  and significant guarantee obligations  any of which could substantially harm our business and financial condition 
we and toshiba have restructured our flashvision business and transferred certain assets to toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facility in japan  which may cause production delays and reduce nand wafer supply available to us  which could adversely impact our operating results 
on june   we  along with toshiba  formed flashvision for the joint development and manufacture of several nand flash memory products  including megabit  gigabit and other advanced flash memory products 
we and toshiba will each separately market and sell these products 
accordingly  we will compete directly with toshiba for sales of products incorporating these jointly developed and manufactured products 
in april  we and toshiba entered into a series of agreements that restructured our flashvision business and provided for the transfer of its operations to toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facility in japan 
pursuant to the terms of the agreements  toshiba completed transfer of all required equipment from 
table of contents dominion to yokkaichi in and bore substantially all of the costs associated with the equipment transfers 
it is possible that production may not continue at yokkaichi as planned  thereby reducing the total nand production capacity available to us 
in addition  we incurred substantial start up expenses related to the hiring and training of manufacturing personnel  and installing the clean room facilities and equipment at the dominion fabrication facility 
although as part of our agreement with toshiba to restructure our flashvision business we have recaptured  substantially all of the dominion start up expenses incurred by us  we have incurred similar start up expenses in connection with the new yokkaichi fabrication facility 
we will incur start up costs and pay our share of ongoing operating activities even if we do not utilize our full share of the new yokkaichi output 
each time that we and toshiba add substantial new wafer fabrication capacity  we will experience startup costs as a result of the one to two quarters of delay between the time of the investment and the time qualified products manufactured on the new wafer fabrication capacity are sold 
we expect to fund up to approximately million for the initial fabrication capacity expansion in we face challenges and possible delays relating to the expected shift in a portion of our production at yokkaichi to micron nand  which could adversely affect our operating results 
we were using the production capacity at toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facility to manufacture nand flash memory wafers with minimum lithographic feature size of micron 
late in  we began shifting a portion of our production output at yokkaichi to micron nand and expect to shift the majority of our production output at yokkaichi to micron nand in the second half of such minimum feature sizes are considered today to be among the most advanced for mass production of silicon wafers 
therefore  it is difficult to predict how long it will take to achieve adequate yields  reliable operation  and economically attractive product costs based on our new designs 
we currently rely and will continue to rely on toshiba to address these challenges 
with our investments in the flashvision joint venture at toshiba s yokkaichi facility  we are now and will continue to be exposed to the adverse financial impact of any delays or manufacturing problems associated with wafer production lines 
any problems or delays in volume production at the yokkaichi fabrication facility could adversely impact our operating results in and beyond 
toshiba s yokkaichi facilities are a significant source of supply of nand flash memory wafers and any disruption in this supply will reduce our revenues  earnings and gross margins 
although we buy flash memory from the flashvision joint venture  we also rely on toshiba s yokkaichi fabrication facility to supply on a foundry basis a portion of our nand flash memory wafers 
even if flashvision successfully produces quantities at planned levels  the yokkaichi fabrication foundry facilities may not produce satisfactory quantities of wafers with acceptable prices  reliability and yields 
any failure in this regard may curtail our business  financial condition and results of operations  as our right to purchase nand flash memory products from samsung is limited and may not be sufficient to replace any shortfall in production at the yokkaichi facilities 
in addition  any disruption in supply from the yokkaichi fabrication facility due to natural disaster  power failure  labor unrest or other causes could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  we have no experience in operating a wafer manufacturing line and we intend to rely on the existing manufacturing organizations at the yokkaichi fabrication facilities 
if toshiba and flashvision are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy our wafer supply requirements  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be harmed 
our obligations under our wafer supply agreements with toshiba and flashvision  or decreased demand for our products  may result in excess inventories and lead to inventory write offs  and any technical difficulties or manufacturing problems may result in shortages in supply  either of which would adversely affect our business 
under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with toshiba  we are obligated to purchase half of flashvision s nand wafer production output and we will also purchase nand wafers from toshiba s current yokkaichi fabrication facility on a foundry relationship basis 
if we are unable for any reason to 
table of contents achieve customer acceptance of our card products built with these nand flash chips or if demand decreases  we will experience a significant increase in our inventory  which may result in inventory write offs and harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
apart from our commitment to purchase wafer output from flashvision  under our foundry relationship with toshiba  we order nand wafers under purchase orders that cannot be cancelled 
if we place purchase orders with toshiba and our business condition deteriorates  we may end up with excess inventories of nand wafers  which could harm our business and financial condition 
should customer demand for nand flash products be less than our available supply  we may suffer from reduced revenues and increased expenses  and increased inventory of unsold nand flash wafers  which could adversely affect our operating results 
under the terms of our foundry relationship with toshiba and wafer supply agreements with flashvision  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders  which are difficult to estimate 
generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments 
the estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
in addition  in order for us to sell nand based cf cards  sd cards and multimediacards  we have been developing new controllers  printed circuit boards and test algorithms 
any technical difficulties or delays in the development of these elements could prevent us from taking advantage of the available nand output and could adversely affect our results of operations 
see risks related to our flashvision joint venture 
we have contingent indemnification obligations for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
flashvision secured a new equipment lease arrangement of approximately billion japanese yen or approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed in may with mizuho corporate bank  ltd  or mizuho  and certain other financial institutions 
under the terms of the new lease  toshiba is required to provide a guarantee to these financial institutions on behalf of flashvision 
we have agreed to indemnify toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
if flashvision fails to meet its lease commitments  and toshiba fulfills these commitments under the terms of toshiba s guarantee  then we will be obligated to reimburse toshiba for of any claims under the lease  unless such claims result from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or its covenants to the lenders 
because flashvision s new equipment lease arrangement is denominated in japanese yen  the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
as of december   the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation  which reflects payments and any lease adjustments  was approximately million 
risks related to our investment in tower semiconductor ltd 
our investments in tower semiconductor ltd 
are subject to certain inherent risks  including those associated with certain israeli regulatory requirements  political unrest and financing difficulties  which could harm our business and financial condition 
in july  we entered into a share purchase agreement to make a million investment in tower for its new wafer foundry facility  fab as of december   we had invested million in tower and obtained  ordinary shares  million of prepaid wafer credits  and a warrant to purchase  ordinary tower shares at an exercise price of per share 
this warrant expires on october  the investment in the ordinary shares represents an approximate current equity ownership position in tower as of december  in and  we recognized losses of million and million  respectively  on the other than temporary decline in the value of our tower investment and the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and approximately million in unrealized losses related to the fair value of the warrants purchased in october of our investment in tower was valued at million as of december  at december   our prepaid wafer credits were valued at million  which is net 
table of contents of million in write downs recorded in fiscal  related to the recoverability of these prepaid wafer credits 
in march  we amended our foundry investment agreements with tower by agreeing to advance the payments for the third and fourth milestones 
the payment for the third milestone of million was made on april  in exchange for this payment we received  ordinary shares and prepaid wafer credits of million 
the payment of million for the fourth milestone was paid on september  in exchange for this payment we received  ordinary shares of tower and million in prepaid wafer credits 
these wafer credits were credited to our pre paid wafer account and are to be applied against orders placed with fab  when completed  provided  however  that until july   the amounts added to the pre paid wafer account may only be applied towards a maximum of of our wafer purchases 
we periodically assess the value of our prepaid wafer credits considering the timing and quantity of our planned annual wafer purchases  the status of the foundry construction and general economic conditions 
if we determine that the value of these wafer credits is not recoverable  an additional write down will be recorded 
in addition to our commitment under the share purchase agreement  we invested in tower s stock rights offering in october tower issued one right for each shares owned by record holders as of the record date 
in exercising our rights to participate  we paid approximately million in exchange for  ordinary tower shares and a warrant to purchase  ordinary shares at per share 
this warrant expires on october  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a write down in the fair value of these tower warrants of approximately million 
the fair value of these warrants will continue to fluctuate and additional adjustments to the warrant s fair value will be recorded in future periods 
in february  we agreed to further amend our foundry investment agreements with tower  by agreeing to advance the payment for the fifth and final milestone 
this amendment is subject to approval by all required parties  including tower s shareholders 
if approved  the terms of the amendment require the payment of million for the advanced fifth milestone and this payment will be made in two installments 
the first installment of approximately million will be due five business days after the amendment is approved by all required parties  including tower s shareholders  the second installment of approximately million will be due five business days after tower has raised additional funds equal to approximately million  referred to as the minimum financing 
tower must complete the minimum financing prior to december   or we will not be obligated to pay the second installment 
each of the first and second installments will be paid provided tower meets these conditions  whether or not tower actually achieves its original fifth milestone obligation 
immediately following the advancement of the first installment  we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of tower equivalent to the first installment divided by the average trading price for ordinary shares of tower during the thirty consecutive trading days preceding the date the amendment was approved by tower s board of directors 
immediately following the advancement of the second installment  if it occurs  we will be issued fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of tower equivalent to the second installment divided by the price per ordinary share of tower paid in connection with the minimum financing  or the minimum financing price  provided  however  that if the minimum financing price cannot reasonably be calculated from the documents evidencing the minimum financing  then the minimum financing price shall be deemed to be the average trading price for the ordinary shares of tower during the thirty consecutive trading days preceding the date the second installment is paid 
in addition  we have the option to convert all or a portion of our unused pre paid wafer credits associated with the september fourth milestone payment into fully paid and non assessable ordinary shares of tower based on the average closing price of ordinary shares of tower during the thirty consecutive trading days preceding december  completion of tower s wafer foundry facility  fab  is dependent on several factors and may never occur  which may harm our business and results of operations 
tower s completion of fab is dependent on its ability to obtain additional financing for the foundry construction from equity and other sources and the release of grants and approvals for changes in grant programs from the israeli government s investment center 
the current political uncertainty and security situation in the region may adversely impact tower s business prospects and may discourage investments in 
table of contents tower from outside sources 
if tower is unable to obtain additional financing  complete foundry construction in a timely manner or is unable to successfully complete the development and transfer of advanced cmos process technologies and ramp up of production  the value of our equity investment in tower and wafer credits will decline significantly or possibly become worthless 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain sufficient supply of wafers to manufacture our products  which would harm our business 
the value of our equity investment in tower may also be adversely affected by further deterioration of conditions in the market for foundry manufacturing services and the market for semiconductor products generally 
if the fair value of our tower investment declines further  we may record additional losses  which potentially could amount to the remaining recorded value of our tower investment 
moreover  if tower is unable to satisfy certain financial covenants and comply with certain conditions as required by its credit facility agreement  and therefore is not able to obtain additional bank financing  or its current bank obligations are accelerated  or it fails to secure customers for its foundry capacity to help offset its fixed costs  such failure could jeopardize the completion of fab and tower s ability to continue operations 
we cannot assure you that the tower facility will be completed or will begin production as scheduled  or that the processes needed to fabricate our wafers will be qualified at the new facility 
moreover  we cannot assure you that this new facility will be able to achieve acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis at a competitive price 
furthermore  if the depressed business conditions for semiconductor wafers persists throughout and beyond  tower may be unable to operate fab at an optimum capacity utilization  which would cause them to operate at a loss or to discontinue operations 
the current political unrest and violence in israel may hinder tower s ability to obtain investment in and complete its fabrication facility  which would harm our business 
although we do not believe the current political unrest and continuing escalation of violence in israel represent a major security problem for tower since migdal haemek  israel is in a relatively secure geographic location  the unrest may expand and even if it remains at current levels  could cause scheduling delays  as well as economic uncertainty  which could cause potential investors and foundry customers to avoid tower 
moreover  if us military actions in iraq  or elsewhere  result in retaliation against israel  tower s fabrication facility may be adversely impacted causing a decline in the value of our investment 
risks related to our investment in umc fluctuations in the market value of our umc foundry investment affect our financial results and in fiscal we recorded a loss on investment in foundry of million on our umc investment and we may record additional losses in the future 
in  we invested million in united silicon  inc  or usic  a semiconductor manufacturing subsidiary of united microelectronics corporation  or umc  which was merged into the umc parent company on january  in exchange for our usic shares  we received million umc shares 
in  and  we received additional shares as stock dividends totaling approximately million  million and million shares  respectively 
our equity investment in umc was valued at million at december  and included an unrealized loss of million  which was included in other comprehensive income 
in fiscal  we recorded a loss of million  or million net of taxes  on the other than temporary decline in the value of our umc investment 
if the fair value of our umc investment declines in future periods  we may record additional losses for those periods 
in addition  in future periods  we may recognize a gain or loss upon the sale of our umc shares  which will impact our financial results 
risks related to vendors and subcontractors we depend on our suppliers and third party subcontractors for several of the critical components and our products and our business could be harmed if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of these components on a timely basis 
we rely on our vendors  some of which are sole source suppliers  for several of our critical components 
we do not have long term supply agreements with some of these vendors 
our business  financial condition 
table of contents and operating results could be significantly harmed by delays or reductions in shipments if we are unable to develop alternative sources or obtain sufficient quantities of these components 
we also rely on third party subcontractors for our wafer testing  packaged memory final testing  card assembly and card testing  including silicon precision industries co  ltd 
and united test center  inc in taiwan and celestica  inc and flextronics in china 
in addition to our existing subcontract suppliers  we are qualifying other subcontract suppliers for wafer testing  packaged memory final testing  card assembly and card testing services 
we have no long term contracts with existing subcontractors nor do we expect to have long term contracts with new subcontract suppliers 
as such  we cannot and will not be able to directly control product delivery schedules 
any significant problems that occur at our subcontractor suppliers  or their failure to perform at the level we expect could lead to product shortages or quality assurance problems  which could increase the manufacturing costs of our products and have adverse effects on our operating results 
furthermore  we are manufacturing on a turnkey basis with some of our existing subcontract suppliers as well as with our anticipated newly qualified subcontract suppliers  which may reduce our visibility and control of their inventories of purchased parts necessary to build our products 
we depend on third party foundries for silicon wafers and any shortage or disruption in our supply from these sources will reduce our revenues  earnings and gross margins 
all of our flash memory card products require silicon wafers  a substantial majority of which are currently supplied by toshiba s wafer facility at yokkaichi  japan  as well as umc in taiwan and to a lesser extent by hitachi and samsung 
our nand flash memory products are substantially supplied by toshiba s yokkaichi wafer fabrication facilities and  to a lesser extent  by samsung 
if toshiba  flashvision  samsung and umc are uncompetitive or are unable to satisfy these requirements  our business  financial condition and operating results may suffer 
any disruption in supply from these sources due to natural disaster  power failure  labor unrest or other causes could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our obligation to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders under the terms of our wafer supply agreements with toshiba  flashvision  samsung and umc  limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products which may lead to excess wafer inventories and could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
under the terms of our supply agreements with flashvision  hitachi  samsung  toshiba  tower and umc  we are obligated to provide a six month rolling forecast of anticipated purchase orders  generally  the estimates for the first three months of each rolling forecast are binding commitments 
the estimates for the remaining months of the forecast may only be changed by a certain percentage from the previous month s forecast 
in addition  we are obligated to purchase of all of flashvision s wafer production 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products 
for example  if customer demand falls below our forecast and we are unable to reschedule or cancel our orders  we may end up with excess inventories  which could result in higher operating expenses and reduced gross margins 
conversely  if customer demand exceeds our forecasts  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of wafers and flash memory products to fill customer orders  which could result in dissatisfied customers  lost sales and lower revenues 
if we are unable to obtain scheduled quantities of wafers or flash memory products with acceptable price and or yields from any foundry  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
we and our manufacturing partners must achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields or our costs will increase and production output will decrease  which could negatively impact our business 
the fabrication of our products requires wafers to be produced in a highly controlled and ultra clean environment 
semiconductor companies that supply our wafers sometimes have experienced problems achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function of both our design technology and the foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures 
yield problems may not be determined or improved until an actual product is made and can be tested 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until the wafers are well into the production process 
the risks associated with yields are even greater because we rely exclusively on 
table of contents independent offshore foundries for our wafers which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
if the foundries cannot achieve planned yields  we will experience higher costs and reduced product availability  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks related to competition we face competition from flash memory manufacturers and memory card assemblers and if we cannot compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we compete in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
our competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have greater access to advanced wafer foundry capacity  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers 
our primary competitors include companies that develop and manufacture storage flash chips  such as hitachi  samsung and toshiba 
in addition  we compete with companies that manufacture other forms of flash memory and companies that purchase flash memory components and assemble memory cards 
companies that manufacture socket flash  linear flash and components include advanced micro devices  atmel  fujitsu  intel  macronix  mitsubishi  sharp electronics and st microelectronics 
companies that combine controllers and flash memory chips developed by others into flash storage cards  or that resell flash cards under their brand name include dane elec manufacturing  delkin devices  inc  fuji  hagiwara  hama  i o data  infineon  jessops  kingston technology  kodak  lexar media  m systems  matsushita battery  matsushita panasonic  memorex  micron technology  pny  pqi  pretec  silicon storage technology  silicon tek  simple technology  sony  tdk  toshiba and viking components and several other resellers primarily located in taiwan 
we have entered into agreements with  and face direct competition from  toshiba  samsung and other competitors 
in  we along with matsushita and toshiba  formed the secure digital association  or sd association  to jointly develop and promote the secure digital card 
under this arrangement  royalty bearing secure digital card licenses will be available to other flash memory card manufacturers  resulting in increased competition for our secure digital card and other products 
in addition  matsushita and toshiba sell secure digital cards that compete directly with our products 
while other flash card manufacturers are required to pay license fees and royalties  which will be shared among matsushita  toshiba and us  there are no royalties or license fees payable among the three companies for their respective sales of the secure digital card 
thus  we forfeit potential royalty income from secure digital card sales by matsushita and toshiba 
to date we have not received any meaningful royalties from any sd licensees 
in addition  we and toshiba each separately market and sell nand flash memory products developed and manufactured by our joint venture  flashvision 
accordingly  we compete directly with toshiba for sales of these products 
moreover  we rely principally on toshiba  and to a lesser extent samsung  for our nand flash memory supply 
we have entered into patent cross license agreements with several of our leading competitors including hitachi  intel  matsushita  sst  samsung  sharp  sony  toshiba and tdk 
under these agreements  each party may manufacture and sell products that incorporate technology covered by the other party s patent or patents related to flash memory devices 
as we continue to license our patents to certain of our competitors  competition will increase and may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently  we are engaged in licensing discussions with several of our competitors 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in concluding licensing agreements under terms which are favorable to us  or at all 

table of contents our products compete against new products that promote different industry standards from ours  and if these new industry standards gain market acceptance  our business will be harmed 
competing products have been introduced that promote industry standards that are different from our products including  m systems diskonkey  a usb based memory device  the secure multimediacard from hitachi and infineon 
in addition  in  fuji and olympus introduced the xd picture card format  which could lead to decreased revenues  as well as  write downs for obsolete inventory  of our smart media card products in each competing standard may not be mechanically and electronically compatible with our products 
if a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs in one of these alternative competing standards  our products will be eliminated from use in that product 
in addition  other companies  such as sanyo and matrix semiconductor have announced products or technologies that may potentially compete with our products 
the microdrive  which hitachi recently acquired from ibm  is a rotating disk drive in a type ii cf format  which competes directly with our larger capacity cf memory cards 
m systems diskonchip millennium product competes against our nand flash components in embedded storage applications such as set top boxes and networking appliances 
sony has licensed its proprietary memory stick to us and other companies and sony has agreed to supply us a portion of its memory stick output for resale under our brand name 
in addition  we and sony have co developed and co own the specifications for the next generation memory stick  known as the memorystick pro 
if consumer electronics products using the memory stick pro achieve widespread use  sales of our multimediacard  sd card  smartmedia card and cf card products may decline 
our multimediacard products also have faced significant competition from toshiba s smartmedia flash cards 
we face competition from products based on alternative flash technologies and if we cannot compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we also face competition from products based on mlc flash technology from intel and hitachi 
these products currently compete with our nand mlc products 
mlc flash is a technological innovation that allows each flash memory cell to store two bits of information instead of the traditional single bit stored by conventional flash technology 
in addition  infineon has recently formed a separate business unit  called infineon flash  that was formed to develop and commercialize a new flash technology called nrom  which offers bits per cell and is claimed to match the density of our nand mlc 
infineon has also stated its intention to utilize this nrom flash memory technology  once it reaches production  in a line of flash cards that will compete with our cards  including our multimediacard and sd card 
moreover  each of micron technology  inc  hynix semiconductor inc  and st microelectronics  have stated their intention to compete with nand flash memory with their own flash products 
if any of these competitors is successful  this new competition could adversely impact our future sales 
furthermore  we expect to face competition both from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets that have similar or alternative data storage solutions  which may be less costly or provide additional features 
price is an important competitive factor in the market for consumer products 
increased price competition could lower gross margins if our average selling prices decrease faster than our costs and could also result in lost sales 
risks related to sales of our products sales to a small number of customers represent a significant portion of our revenues and if we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
approximately one half of our revenues come from a small number of customers 
for example  sales to our top customers accounted for approximately of our product revenues in  and if we were to lose one of our major customers or experience any material reduction in orders from any of these customers  our revenues and operating results would suffer 
our sales are generally made by standard purchase 
table of contents orders rather than long term contracts 
in addition  the composition of our major customer base changes from year to year as the market demand for our customers products changes 
variability of average selling prices and gross margins resulting from changes in our product mix and price reductions for certain of our products may cause our gross margins and net profitability to suffer 
our product mix varies quarterly  which affects our overall average selling prices and gross margins 
our cf card  sd card  smartmedia card  and multimediacard products  which currently represent the majority of our product revenues  have lower average selling prices and gross margins than our higher capacity flashdisk and flashdrive products 
we believe that sales of cf card  sd card  smartmedia card  and multimediacard card products will continue to represent the majority of our product revenues as consumer applications  such as digital cameras and digital music players  become more popular 
flash data storage markets are intensely competitive  and price reductions for our products are necessary to meet consumer price points 
in  due to competitive pricing pressures  our average selling price per megabyte declined by approximately compared to due to the oversupply of flash memory foundry capacity and the economic slow down in  our average selling price per megabyte declined compared to was much more severe than the decrease we experienced in price declines for our products could continue to be significant 
if we cannot reduce our product manufacturing costs in future periods to offset further price reductions  our gross margins and net profitability will suffer 
our selling prices may decline due to excess capacity in the market for flash memory products and if we cannot reduce our manufacturing costs to offset these price declines  our gross margins and net profitability will be harmed 
throughout  worldwide flash memory supply exceeded customer demand  causing excess supply in the markets for our products and significant declines in average selling prices 
if this situation were to occur again in  price declines for our products could be significant 
if we are unable to reduce our product manufacturing costs to offset these reduced prices  our gross margins and net profitability would be adversely impacted 
our business depends significantly upon sales of products in the highly competitive consumer market  a significant portion of which are made to retailers and through distributors  and if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market  we could experience substantial product returns  which would negatively impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in and  we continued to receive more product revenue and ship more units of products for consumer electronics applications  including digital cameras and pdas  compared to other applications 
the consumer market is intensely competitive and is more price sensitive than our other target markets 
in addition  we must spend more on marketing and promotion in consumer markets to establish brand name recognition and drive demand 
a significant portion of our sales to the consumer electronics market are made to retailers and through distributors 
sales through these channels typically include rights to return unsold inventory 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue until after the product has been sold through to the end user 
if our distributors and retailers are not successful in this market  there could be substantial product returns  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
sales of our products through our retail distribution channel include the use of third party fulfillment facilities that hold our manufacturing components and finished goods on a consignment basis  and if these fulfillment facilities were to experience a loss with respect to our inventory  we may not be able to recoup the full cost of the inventory  which would harm our business 
our retail distribution channel utilizes third party fulfillment facilities  such as modus media international  inc these fulfillment houses hold our manufacturing components and finished goods on a consignment basis  providing packout services for our retail business  which include labeling and packaging our raw cards  
table of contents as well as shipping the finished product directly to our customers 
while our third party fulfillment houses bear the risk of loss with respect to our inventory  the amount we are reimbursed by them or their insurers may be less than our original cost to produce the inventory  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is seasonality in our business  which may impact our product sales  particularly in the fourth and first quarters of the fiscal year 
sales of our products in the consumer electronics market may be subject to seasonality 
as a result  product sales may be impacted by seasonal purchasing patterns with higher sales generally occurring in the fourth quarter of each year followed by declines in the first quarter of the following year 
in addition  in the past we have experienced a decrease in orders in the first quarter from our japanese oem customers primarily because most customers in japan operate on a fiscal year ending in march and prefer to delay purchases until the beginning of their next fiscal year 
we may not be successful selling our products on the internet and these sales may undercut our traditional sales channels 
web based sales of our products today represent a small but growing portion of our overall sales 
sales on the internet tend to undercut traditional distribution channels and may dramatically change the way our consumer products are purchased in future years 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully develop the internet sales channel or successfully manage the inherent conflict between the internet and our traditional sales channels 
risks related to our intellectual property we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyright and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
in the past  we have been involved in significant disputes regarding our intellectual property rights and claims that we may be infringing third parties intellectual property rights 
we expect that we may be involved in similar disputes in the future 
we cannot assure you that any of our existing patents will not be invalidated  patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength  our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage  or any of our products do not infringe on the patents of other companies 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design their products around our patents 
we intend to vigorously enforce our patents but we cannot be sure that our efforts will be successful 
if we were to have an adverse result in any litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
any litigation is likely to result in significant expense to us  as well as divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 

table of contents we may be unable to license intellectual property to or from third parties as needed  or renew existing licenses  and we have agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement  which could expose us to liability for damages  increase our costs or limit or prohibit us from selling certain products 
if we decide to incorporate third party technology into our products or if we are found to infringe on others intellectual property  we could be required to license intellectual property from a third party 
we may also need to license some of our intellectual property to others in order to enable us to obtain cross licenses to third party patents 
currently  we have patent cross license agreements with several companies  including hitachi  intel  matsushita  sst  samsung  sharp  smartdisk  sony  tdk and toshiba and we are in discussions with other companies regarding potential cross license agreements 
we cannot be certain that licenses will be offered when we need them  or that the terms offered will be acceptable 
if we do obtain licenses from third parties  we may be required to pay license fees or royalty payments 
in addition  if we are unable to obtain a license that is necessary to the manufacture of our products  we could be required to suspend the manufacture of products or stop our wafer suppliers from using processes that may infringe the rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in redesigning our products or that the necessary licenses will be available under reasonable terms  or that our existing licensees will renew their licenses upon expiration  or that we will be successful in signing new licensees in the future 
we have historically agreed to indemnify various suppliers and customers for alleged patent infringement 
the scope of such indemnity varies  but may  in some instances  include indemnification for damages and expenses  including attorney s fees 
we may periodically engage in litigation as a result of these indemnification obligations 
we are not currently engaged in any such indemnification proceedings 
our insurance policies exclude coverage for third party claims for patent infringement 
any future obligation to indemnify our customers or suppliers could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we may be involved in litigation regarding our intellectual property rights or those of third parties  which would be costly and would divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
litigation is subject to inherent risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
factors that could cause litigation results to differ include  but are not limited to  the discovery of previously unknown facts  changes in the law or in the interpretation of laws  and uncertainties associated with the judicial decision making process 
furthermore  parties that we have sued and that we may sue for patent infringement may counter sue us for infringing their patents 
on or about august   the lemelson medical  education research foundation  or lemelson foundation  filed a complaint for patent infringement against us and four other defendants

on november   the parties filed a stipulated dismissal without prejudice  which was entered by the court on december  
table of contents risks related to our international operations  war in iraq and threats of war elsewhere  and changes in securities laws and regulations because of our international operations  we must comply with numerous international laws and regulations and we are vulnerable to political instability and currency fluctuations 
political risks 
currently  the majority of our flash memory and controller wafers are produced by toshiba in japan and umc in taiwan 
after the restructuring of our flashvision business and the signing of our new flash memory purchase agreement with samsung  all of our flash memory and controller wafers and flash memory products are now produced overseas by toshiba  umc and samsung 
we also use third party subcontractors in taiwan  china and japan for the assembly and testing of some of our card and component products 
we may therefore be affected by the political  economic and military conditions in these countries 
taiwan is currently engaged in various political disputes with china and in the past both countries have conducted military exercises in or near the other s territorial waters and airspace 
the taiwanese and chinese governments may escalate these disputes  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping routes or even military hostilities 
this could harm our business by interrupting or delaying the production or shipment of flash memory wafers or card products by our taiwanese or japanese foundries and subcontractors 
under its current leadership  the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies  including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
the chinese government may not continue to pursue these policies and  even if it does continue  these policies may not be successful 
the chinese government may also significantly alter these policies from time to time 
in addition  china does not currently have a comprehensive and highly developed legal system  particularly with respect to the protection of intellectual property rights 
as a result  enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain  and the implementation and interpretation of such laws may be inconsistent 
such inconsistency could lead to piracy and degradation of our intellectual property protection 
although we do not believe the current political unrest and continuing escalation of violence in israel represent a major security problem for tower since migdal haemek  israel is in a relatively secure geographic location  the unrest may expand and even if it remains at current levels  could cause scheduling delays  as well as economic uncertainty  which could cause potential foundry customers to go elsewhere for their foundry business 
moreover  if us military actions in afghanistan  iraq or elsewhere  or current israeli military actions  result in retaliation against israel  tower s fabrication facility and our engineering design center in israel may be adversely impacted 
in addition  while the political unrest has not yet posed a direct security risk to our engineering design center in israel  it may cause unforeseen delays in the development of our products and may in the future pose such a direct security risk 
economic risks 
we price our products primarily in us dollars 
if the euro  yen and other currencies weaken relative to the us dollar  our products may be relatively more expensive in these regions  which could result in a decrease in our sales 
while most of our sales are denominated in us dollars  we invoice certain japanese customers in japanese yen and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations on these transactions  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
general risks 
our international business activities could also be limited or disrupted by any of the following factors the need to comply with foreign government regulation  general geopolitical risks such as political and economic instability  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  natural disasters affecting the countries in which we conduct our business  particularly japan  such as the earthquakes experienced in taiwan in and in japan and china in previous years  imposition of regulatory requirements  tariffs  import and export restrictions and other barriers and restrictions  
table of contents longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  particularly as we increase our sales through the retail distribution channel  and general business conditions deteriorate  adverse tax rules and regulations  weak protection of our intellectual property rights  and delays in product shipments due to local customs restrictions 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
the terrorist attacks in the united states  the us retaliation for these attacks  the war in iraq and threats of war elsewhere and the related decline in consumer confidence and continued economic weakness have had a substantial adverse impact on our retail sales 
any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and suppliers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these events have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general and consumer confidence and spending in particular  which could harm our sales 
in addition  recent consumer reports indicate that consumer confidence has reached its lowest level since if consumer confidence continues to decline or does not recover  our revenues and results of operations may be adversely impacted throughout and beyond 
any of these events could increase volatility in the us and world financial markets  which could harm our stock price and may limit the capital resources available to us and our customers or suppliers 
this could have a significant impact on our operating results  revenues and costs and may result in increased volatility in the market price of our common stock 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
the act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects 
in addition to final rules and rule proposals already made  nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies  such as us  that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal and financial compliance costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new option plans 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee and qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
risks related to our charter documents  stockholder rights plan  our stock price and our debt rating anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  stockholder rights plan and in delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders 
we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
this could prevent us from being acquired 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
preferred stock may also have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the 
table of contents market value of our common stock 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
this section provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of sandisk 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  volatile  which could result in investors losing all or part of their investments 
the market price of our stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  in the months ending december   our stock price fluctuated significantly from a low of to a high of 
we believe that such fluctuations will continue as a result of future announcements concerning us  our competitors or principal customers regarding technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimates by analysts 
in addition  in recent years the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of high technology and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile  often for reasons outside the control of the particular companies 
these fluctuations as well as general economic  political and market conditions may have an adverse affect on the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  the market price for the notes may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of our common stock or deterioration of our financial performance  declines in the overall market for similar securities and the actual or perceived performance or prospects for companies in our industry 
the ratings assigned to us and our notes may fluctuate  which could harm the market price of the notes and our common stock 
we and our notes have been rated by standard poor s ratings services  and may be rated by other rating agencies in the future 
standard poor s ratings services assigned its b corporate credit rating to us and its ccc subordinated debt rating to our notes 
if our current ratings are lowered or if other rating agencies assign us or the notes ratings lower than expected by investors  the market price of the notes and our common stock would be significantly harmed 
risks related to our indebtedness we have increased our indebtedness through our convertible subordinated notes offering  which may restrict our cash flow  make it difficult for us to obtain future financing  divert our resources from other uses  limit our ability to react to changes in the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
as a result of the sale and issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in december and january  we incurred million aggregate principal amount of additional indebtedness  substantially increasing our ratio of debt to total capitalization 
while the notes are outstanding  we will have debt service obligations on the notes of approximately million per year in interest payments 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash to meet these obligations and must instead use our existing cash or investments  we may have to reduce  curtail or terminate other activities of our business 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from cash generated by our operations  if any  and from our existing cash and investments 
if necessary  among other alternatives  we may add lease lines of credit to finance capital expenditures and obtain other long term debt and lines of credit 
we may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could require the dedication of a substantial portion of any cash flow from our operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  
table of contents cause us to use a significant portion of our cash and cash equivalents or possibly liquidate other assets to repay the total principal amount due under the notes and our other indebtedness if we were to default under the notes or our other indebtedness  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business and the industries in which we complete  place us at a possible competitive disadvantage with respect to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a further downturn in our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to meet our debt service obligations  including our obligations under the notes 
in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with toshiba  under which we formed flashvision 
in may  flashvision secured a new equipment lease arrangement of approximately billion japanese yen or approximately million based on the exchange rate in effect on the date the agreement was executed with mizuho corporate bank  ltd  or mizuho  and certain other financial institutions 
under the terms of the new lease  toshiba is required to provide a guarantee to these financial institutions on behalf of flashvision 
we have agreed to indemnify toshiba in certain circumstances for certain liabilities toshiba incurs as a result of toshiba s guarantee of the flashvision equipment lease arrangement 
if flashvision fails to meet its lease commitments  and toshiba fulfills these commitments under the term of toshiba s guarantee  we will be obligated to reimburse toshiba for of any claims under the lease  unless such claims result from toshiba s failure to meet its obligations to flashvision or its covenants to the lenders 
because flashvision s new equipment lease arrangement is denominated in japanese yen  the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation on a given date when converted to us dollars will fluctuate based on the exchange rate in effect on that date 
as of december   the maximum amount of our contingent indemnification obligation  which reflects payments and any lease adjustments  was approximately million 
this contingent indemnification obligation might constitute senior indebtedness under the notes and we may use a portion of the proceeds from the notes to repay the obligation 
this would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to satisfy a fundamental change offer under the indenture governing the notes 
the indenture governing the notes contains provisions that apply to a fundamental change 
a fundamental change as defined in the indenture would occur if we were to be acquired for consideration other than cash or securities traded on a major us securities market 
if someone triggers a fundamental change  we may be required to offer to purchase the notes with cash 
this would result in the diversion of resources from other important areas of our business and could significantly harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we have to make a fundamental change offer  we cannot be sure that we will have enough funds to pay for all the notes that the holders could tender 
our failure to redeem tendered notes upon a fundamental change would constitute a default under the indenture and might constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness  which would significantly harm our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations  which would cause us to be in default under the terms of our indebtedness  which would result in harm to our business and financial condition 
if our cash flow is inadequate to meet our obligations  we could face substantial liquidity problems 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the notes or our other indebtedness  we would be in default under the terms thereof  which would permit the holders of the notes to accelerate the maturity of the notes and also could cause defaults under our other 
table of contents indebtedness 
any such default would harm our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we would be able to repay amounts due in respect of the notes if payment of the notes were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the indenture governing the notes 
moreover  we cannot assure that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the notes at maturity 
we may need additional financing  which could be difficult to obtain  and which if not obtained in satisfactory amounts may prevent us from developing or enhancing our products  taking advantage of future opportunities  growing our business or responding to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could harm our business 
we currently expect that our existing cash and investment balances  including the proceeds of the notes  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements to fund operations and expected capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  in the event we need to raise additional funds during that time period or in future periods  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
from time to time  we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings to fund our activities 
if we issue additional equity securities  our stockholders will experience additional dilution and the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock or debt securities 
in addition  if we raise funds through debt financing  we will have to pay interest and may be subject to restrictive covenants  which could harm our business 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms  if and when needed  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  take advantage of future opportunities  grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated industry changes  any of which could have a negative impact on our business 
the notes and other indebtedness have rights senior to those of our current stockholders such that in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available for distribution to our current stockholders only after all senior indebtedness is repaid 
in the event of our bankruptcy  liquidation or reorganization or upon acceleration of the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain other events  our assets will be available for distribution to our current stockholders only after all senior indebtedness  including our contingent indemnification obligations to toshiba and obligations under the notes  have been paid in full 
as a result  there may not be sufficient assets remaining to make any distributions to our stockholders 
the notes are also effectively subordinated to the liabilities of any of our subsidiaries including trade payables  which as of december  were 
neither we  nor our subsidiaries are limited from incurring debt  including senior indebtedness  under the indenture 
if we  or our subsidiaries were to incur additional debt or liabilities  our ability to pay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected 
we anticipate that from time to time we will incur additional debt  including senior indebtedness 
our subsidiaries are also likely to incur liabilities in the future 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and marketable equity security prices 
to mitigate some of these risks  we utilize currency forward contracts 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
at december   we had a warrant to purchase ordinary shares of tower at a fair value of approximately  interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities  substantially all of which either mature within the next twelve months or have characteristics of short term investments 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decline less than in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities 
foreign currency risk 
a substantial majority of our revenue  expense and capital purchasing activity are transacted in us dollars 
however  we do enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
currency forward contracts are utilized in this hedging program 
our hedging program reduces  but does not always entirely eliminate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change of in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes in of approximately million 
market risk 
we also hold available for sale equity securities in our short term investment portfolio and equity investments in semiconductor wafer manufacturing companies 
a reduction in prices of of these marketable equity securities would result in a decrease in the fair value of our investments in marketable equity securities of approximately million 
as of december   we had net unrealized losses on short term equity securities totaling million  which were included in other comprehensive income 
these unrealized gains include an unrealized loss of million on the decline in value of our investment in umc 
the market value of our investment in umc has fluctuated significantly in the past and may decline in the future due to downturns in the semiconductor industry  declines in demand for umc s products or unfavorable economic conditions 
if we sell umc shares in future periods  we may recognize a gain or loss due to fluctuations in the market value of our umc stock 
in and  we recognized losses of million and million  respectively  on the other than temporary decline in the value of our tower investment  the impairment in value on our prepaid wafer credits and approximately million of losses related to the fair value of the warrants purchased in october of if the fair value of our tower investment declines further or the wafer credits are deemed to have little or no value  it may be necessary to record additional losses 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
