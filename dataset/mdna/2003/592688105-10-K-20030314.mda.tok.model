item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements 
overview we operate a global business  with net sales that are diversified by geographic region  product range and customer 
we hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors  including the strength of our brand name and reputation  our comprehensive solution offering  the quality of our global sales and service network  our continued investment in product development  our pursuit of technology leadership and our focus on capitalizing on opportunities in developed and emerging markets 
our financial information is presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
net sales in local currency increased in  in  and in the fluctuation of the us dollar versus our major trading currencies increased us dollar reported sales growth in and reduced us dollar reported sales growth in and net sales in us dollars increased in  in  and in in  we had local currency sales growth of in the americas and in asia and other markets  partially offset by a decline of in europe 
we believe our sales growth over the next several years will come primarily from our solutions approach to the principal challenges facing our customer base 
these include the need for increased efficiency for example  in accelerating time to market for new products  achieving better yields  improving work processes and outsourcing non core activities  the desire to integrate information captured by instruments into management information systems  the drive for ever higher quality of our customers products and services  including the need to adhere to stringent regulatory and industry standards  and the move towards globalization in all major customer groups 
acquisitions are also an integral part of our growth strategy 
our acquisitions leverage our global sales and service network  respected brand  extensive distribution channels and technological leadership 
we are particularly attracted to acquisitions that leverage these attributes or increase our solutions capability 
in addition  we continue to focus on the following end markets drug discovery  process analytics  food and drug packaging  and transportation and logistics 
we increased our adjusted operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization  interest expense and non recurring costs as a percentage of net sales from in to in  or on a constant currency basis 
this improved performance was achieved while we continued to invest in product development and in our distribution and manufacturing infrastructure 
we believe that a significant portion of the increase in our adjusted operating income resulted from our strategy to reduce costs  re engineer our operations and focus on the highest value added segments of the markets in which we compete 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance on an ongoing basis  and as such is used as an important performance measurement by management 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance 
recent acquisitions we have completed several acquisitions in the last few years  including the following in march  we acquired softechnics inc  based in texas  usa 
softechnics is a leading provider of in store retail item management software solutions 
softechnics provides a key building block in our solution offering to food retailers 
its software provides the full scope of real time item management  thereby allowing retailers to match local store inventory levels with local customer demand 
softechnics strongly complements our leadership position in solutions for the management of fresh goods 
in addition to gaining cross selling benefits  we will be able to offer an integrated data management solution in the future 
in november  we acquired rainin instrument  llc  based in california  usa 
rainin is a leading manufacturer of pipetting solutions used in pharmaceutical  biotech and medical research applications 
rainin has a market leadership position in north america  a truly differentiating technology and a broad patent portfolio in areas like electronic pipetting  ergonomic designs for pipettes and tip designs 
this acquisition further broadens our offering of instruments and solutions to the life sciences market and positions us to bring greater value to our customers 
assuming we acquired rainin as of the beginning of  the acquisition would have added sales of approximately million  adjusted operating income of approximately million  and diluted earnings per share of negative on a pro forma basis 
in  we acquired thornton inc based in massachusetts  usa 
thornton is the leader in pure and ultra pure industrial water monitoring instrumentation used in semiconductor  microelectronics  pharmaceutical  and biotech applications 
we believe the acquisition of thornton is an excellent strategic move to expand our process analytics business and gain access to new markets 
its conductivity technology and know how are complementary to our strength in ph and oxygen measurements 
with a broader technology offering  we will be better able to serve our expanded customer base 
in  we recorded charges for purchased research and development for products that were being developed that had not established technological feasibility as of the date of the acquisition and  if unsuccessful  had no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
these research and development projects related to bohdan automation 
these purchased research and development projects have been completed  and there have been no material differences between actual and projected results 
cost reduction programs as further described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements  in june  the company s management approved restructuring plans to exit manufacturing facilities in france and the united states  and reduce our expense structure 
as part of these efforts to reduce costs  we recorded a charge of million million after tax during the year ended december  the charge comprised involuntary employee separation benefits  write downs of impaired assets to be disposed and other exit costs 
we expect to involuntarily terminate approximately net employees in targeted manufacturing and administrative areas and to substantially complete the manufacturing consolidation by the end of these employees include positions primarily in manufacturing as well as administrative and other personnel  primarily at our principal us and other western european operations 
as a result of these actions  we expect to eliminate approximately million to million of costs from the business 
we estimate that approximately million to million of these savings were realized in  with a further million to million expected in and the remainder in in we recorded a charge of million associated primarily with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
this charge relates primarily to severance and other related benefits and costs of exiting facilities  including lease termination costs and the write down of impaired assets 
in  we recorded a charge of million related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands 
net sales    cost of sales    gross profit    research and development    selling  general and administrative    amortization    interest expense    other charges  net a    earnings before taxes    net earnings    adjusted operating income b    a other charges  net generally includes interest income  foreign currency transactions  gains losses from sales of assets and other items 
the and amounts also include charges of  and  respectively  related primarily to headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
the amount includes a charge of  related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
b adjusted operating income is defined as operating income gross profit less research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses before amortization  interest expense and non recurring costs 
non recurring costs that have been excluded are the costs set forth in note a above 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance on an ongoing basis  and as such is used as an important performance measurement by management 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our operating performance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in the prior year 
this reflected an increase of in local currencies during results for were positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar against other currencies 
net sales in us dollars during increased 
we experienced a sharp decline in sales of our european retail products in as a result of the product conversions required in prior to the introduction of the euro currency 
excluding the impact of european retail products in both and  consolidated local currency sales growth would be for the year ended december  net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales in europe decreased in local currencies during versus the prior year  reflecting weak sales performance across several product lines  particularly in germany and france 
excluding the impact of european retail products in both and  european local currency sales decreased for the year ended december  net sales in local currencies during in the americas increased principally due to the acquisition of rainin instrument in november approximately of rainin s operations are based in the americas  with each in asia and europe 
net sales in asia and other markets increased in local currencies during the results of our business in asia and other markets during reflect particularly strong sales performance in china 
as previously mentioned  we acquired rainin instrument in november assuming we had acquired rainin at the beginning of  the acquisition would have added approximately million of sales and million of adjusted operating income to on a pro forma basis 
our sales decline in europe was primarily due to a decrease in sales of our european retail products after the introduction of the euro currency  as well as a deterioration in economic conditions  particularly in germany and france 
in the americas  there has been no sign to date of a significant economic recovery benefiting the markets for most of our products 
to the extent that economic conditions significantly deteriorate in these or other parts of the world  our sales growth and profitability may be adversely affected 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and for this increase is primarily related to benefits from various cost saving initiatives 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for the prior year 
we continue to make significant investments in research and development  which increased in local currencies in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for  compared to for the prior year  primarily due to changes in our sales mix and our reduced sales volume in europe 
after adjusting for acquisitions and unfavorable foreign currency effects  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in the year ended december  adjusted operating income was million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
the reduced operating margin percentage is due to the combination of two foreign exchange impacts 
first  is the currency translation impact resulting in higher reported us dollar sales due to weaker us dollar exchange rates and second  an unfavorable impact on pre tax earnings of approximately million  due primarily to the strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro and us dollar 
adjusting for these items on a constant currency basis would result in adjusted operating income of approximately of net sales for the year ended december  our adjusted operating income increased million in our principal us operations due primarily to the rainin acquisition and improvements in service profitability 
adjusted operating income declined significantly in europe due to the aforementioned volume impact on european retail after the introduction of the euro currency in in asia and other markets  adjusted operating income increased due to continued growth in china partially offset by declines in other regions 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance on an ongoing basis  and as such is used as an important performance measurement by management 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance 
interest expense remained at million for  as the reduced interest rates were offset by higher average borrowings during to fund the rainin acquisition 
other charges  net were million for  compared to other charges  net of million for the prior year 
the and amounts include charges of million million after tax and million million after tax  respectively  primarily associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
our effective tax rate before non recurring items for the year ended december  was approximately compared with in this reduction reflects the effects of a restructuring of our european operations and other tax initiatives 
in addition  we recorded a one time benefit of million during the second quarter of related to the completion of a tax restructuring program and related tax audits 
during the fourth quarter of  we began a program of repatriating foreign subsidiary earnings to the united states in a tax efficient manner 
this program resulted in a repatriation of million of foreign earnings during in addition  this program will result in the repatriation of million of foreign earnings over the next few years 
the repatriation of million created additional us taxable income resulting in the utilization of certain historical tax attributes related to our us operations and release of the related us federal deferred tax valuation allowance 
the tax effects related to the future repatriation of million were also accrued and included the establishment of other tax attributes related to our us operations 
net earnings were million for the year ended december  compared to net earnings of million in the prior year 
excluding the effect of the previously mentioned charge associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers and the one time tax benefit  net earnings were million for the year ended december  this compares to net earnings of million in the prior year before the prior year restructuring charge 
adjusting for the adoption of sfas  net earnings before restructuring charges and the one time tax benefit for the year ended december  increased 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales were  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in the prior year 
this reflected an increase of in local currencies during results for were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar against other currencies 
net sales in us dollars during increased 
we experienced a sharp increase in sales of our european retail products as a result of the product conversions required in prior to the introduction of the euro currency 
excluding the impact of european retail products in both and  consolidated local currency sales growth would be for the year ended december  net sales by geographic customer location were as follows net sales in europe increased in local currencies during versus the prior year  principally due to strong results in our retail product lines related to the introduction of the euro currency 
excluding the impact of european retail products in both and  european local currency sales increased for the year ended december  net sales in local currencies during in the americas increased 
net sales in asia and other markets increased in local currencies during the results of our business in asia and other markets during reflect particularly strong sales performance in china and japan 
net sales growth in the americas was lower than europe and asia and other markets primarily due to a deterioration in economic conditions 
as previously mentioned  we acquired rainin instrument in november assuming we had acquired rainin at the beginning of  the acquisition would have added approximately million of sales to both and on a pro forma basis 
in total  acquisitions added approximately to sales growth 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for and for this increase is primarily related to benefits from various cost saving initiatives 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were for  compared to for the prior year 
we continue to make significant investments in research and development  which increased in local currencies in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for  compared to for the prior year  in part due to lower distribution costs associated with changes in our sales mix 
adjusted operating income increased to million  or of net sales  for  compared to million  or of net sales  for the prior year 
our adjusted operating income increased significantly in europe due to the favorable impact of the euro currency conversion  but was partially offset by a decline in the principal us operations 
in asia and other markets  adjusted operating income benefited from stronger sales and improved manufacturing productivity in china 
we believe that adjusted operating income provides important financial information in measuring and comparing our operating performance on an ongoing basis  and as such is used as an important performance measurement by management 
adjusted operating income is not intended to represent operating income under us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net earnings as an indicator of our performance 
interest expense decreased to million for  compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease was principally due to reduced debt levels throughout the year 
other charges  net were million for  compared to other charges  net of million for the prior year 
the amount includes a charge of million million after tax primarily associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers 
the amount includes a charge of million related to the close down and consolidation of operations 
our effective tax rate of before non recurring items in was consistent with the previous year 
net earnings were million for the year ended december  compared to net earnings of million in the prior year 
excluding the effect of the previously mentioned charge associated with headcount reductions and manufacturing transfers  net earnings were million for the year ended december  this compares to net earnings of million in the prior year before the prior year restructuring charge 
this represents an increase in net earnings of 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate financing 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
currently  our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
cash provided by operating activities totalled million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in resulted principally from improved working capital management 
included in cash provided by operating activities is an extra contribution of million to the us pension plan 
as a result  we have no significant required contributions to our us plan in the next two years 
cash provided by operating activities includes payments for restructuring  certain acquisition integration activities and a one time payment in associated with an early retirement plan from previous years 
these amounts totalled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
excluding these amounts  cash provided by operating activities totalled million in  compared to million in and million in during  we spent approximately million on acquisitions  including additional consideration related to earn out periods associated with acquisitions consummated in prior years 
the cash portions of these purchases were funded from cash generated from operations and additional borrowings 
we continue to explore potential acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition  we may incur additional indebtedness 
in addition  the terms of certain of our acquisitions in and earlier years provide for possible additional earn out payments 
although we do not currently believe we will make any material payments relating to such earn outs  the maximum amount potentially payable in cash is million  including up to million for rainin based on operating profits through march  capital expenditures are a significant use of funds and are made primarily for machinery  equipment and the purchase and expansion of facilities 
our capital expenditures totalled million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in include spending of million associated with rainin s new facility in california 
we also expect capital expenditures to increase between million and million in  principally due to spending associated with manufacturing transfers to china 
we expect capital expenditures to increase as our business grows  and to fluctuate as currency exchange rates change 
we expect the restructuring charge of million to result in cash outlays of approximately million  of which million had been incurred as of december  and the remainder of which will be substantially incurred during at december   our consolidated debt  net of cash  was million 
we had borrowings of million under our credit agreement and million under various other arrangements as of december  of our credit agreement borrowings  approximately million was borrowed as term loans scheduled to mature in may  and million was borrowed under a multi currency revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million of availability remaining under the revolving credit facility 
at december   approximately million of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in us dollars 
the balance of the borrowings under the credit agreement and local working capital facilities were denominated in certain of our other principal trading currencies amounting to approximately million at december  changes in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity 
in addition  because we borrow in a variety of currencies  our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates 
under the credit agreement  amounts outstanding under the term loans are payable in quarterly installments 
in addition  the credit agreement obligates us to make mandatory prepayments in certain circumstances with the proceeds of asset sales or issuance of capital stock or indebtedness and with certain excess cash flow 
the credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries  including restrictions and limitations on the ability to pay dividends to our shareholders  incur indebtedness  make investments  grant liens  sell financial assets and engage in certain other activities 
we must also comply with several financial and other covenants  including requirements that we maintain the following criteria as specifically defined in our credit agreement o a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of ebitda less capital expenditures to interest expense of at december   this ratio was more than  o a debt to ebitda ratio of no more than at december   this ratio was less than  and o a minimum net worth as specifically defined in the credit agreement of at least million at december   we exceeded the minimum by more than times 
a deterioration in our financial performance could result in a breach of these covenants and trigger the lenders right to require immediate repayment of all or part of the indebtedness 
at december   we are in compliance with all covenants set forth in our credit facility and other indentures 
in addition  we do not have any downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt 
the interest rates for our borrowings under the credit agreement are based in part on our credit rating 
for so long as standard poor s ratings services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies  inc  rates our debt at bbb or above and moody s investors service inc rates our debt at baa or above  our current ratings  the applicable interest rates are determined from a grid that sets out the interest rates for each rating grade 
however  if our credit rating falls below bbb or baa then the applicable interest rates are set by reference to a separate grid in which interest rate levels are determined by our debt to ebitda ratio 
we estimate that if our credit rating was reduced to below investment grade our interest expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we plan to implement a new credit agreement on or before the expiration of the current facility in the following summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
we do not have significant outstanding letters of credit or other financial commitments 
during the ordinary course of business  we enter into contracts to purchase production components for manufacture 
in general these commitments do not extend for more than a few months 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years long term debt a    non cancelable operating leases b      total      a as described in notes and to the audited consolidated financial statements 
b as described in note to the audited consolidated financial statements 
we currently believe that cash flow from operating activities  together with liquidity available under the existing credit agreement or a renegotiated agreement and local working capital facilities  will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and capital spending requirements as well as debt service requirements for at least several years  but there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
effect of currency on results of operations because we conduct operations in many countries  our operating income can be significantly affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
swiss franc denominated expenses represent a much greater percentage of our operating expenses than swiss franc denominated sales represent of our net sales 
in part  this is because most of our manufacturing costs in switzerland relate to products that are sold outside switzerland 
moreover  a substantial percentage of our research and development expenses  and general and administrative expenses are incurred in switzerland 
therefore  if the swiss franc strengthens against all or most of our major trading currencies eg  the eg dollar  the euro  other major european currencies and the japanese yen  our operating profit is reduced 
we also have significantly more sales in european currencies other than the swiss franc than we have expenses in those currencies 
therefore  when european currencies weaken against the us dollar and the swiss franc  it also decreases our operating profits 
during and prior years  the swiss franc and other european currencies have generally moved in a consistent manner versus the us dollar 
therefore  because the two effects previously described have offset each other  our operating profits were not materially affected by movements in the us dollar exchange rate versus european currencies 
however  as evidenced in and  there can be no assurance that these currencies will continue to move in a consistent manner in the future 
in  we estimate that the unfavorable impact due primarily to the strengthening of the swiss franc was approximately million 
we estimate that a one percent strengthening of the swiss franc against the euro would result in a decrease in our earnings before tax of million to million on an annual basis 
in addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits  our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates  particularly between the us dollar and the swiss franc 
taxes we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world 
our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors  such as the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions  the tax rates in such jurisdictions  tax treaties between jurisdictions  the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions  earnings repatriations between jurisdictions and changes in law 
generally  the tax liability for each taxpayer within the group is determined either i on a non consolidated non combined basis or ii on a consolidated combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction  in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non consolidated non combined affiliated legal entities 
as a result  we may pay income taxes to certain jurisdictions even though on an overall basis we incur a net loss for the period 
our effective tax rate before non recurring items for the year ended december  was approximately compared with in this reduction reflects the effects of a restructuring of our european operations and other tax initiatives 
in addition  we recorded a one time benefit of million during the second quarter of related to the completion of a tax restructuring program and related tax audits 
environmental matters we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharges  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and the remediation of contamination associated with the use and disposal of hazardous substances 
we incur capital and operating expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations both in the united states and abroad 
we are currently involved in  or have potential liability with respect to  the remediation of past contamination in facilities both in the united states and abroad 
in addition  some of these facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future 
such sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation 
accordingly  it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition 
inflation inflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use 
the competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices 
moreover  there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products  which may limit our ability to recover increased costs 
we remain committed to operations in china  latin america and eastern europe  which have experienced inflationary conditions 
to date  inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  as our presence in china  latin america and eastern europe increases  these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge short term intercompany balances with our foreign businesses 
such contracts limit our exposure to both favorable and unfavorable currency fluctuations 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar and swiss franc on these foreign currency denominated contracts indicates that if the us dollar and swiss franc uniformly worsened by against all of our currency exposures  the fair value of these instruments would decrease by million at december   as compared with million at december  any resulting changes in fair value would be offset by changes in the underlying hedged balance sheet position 
the sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
the assumption that exchange rates change in parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
we also have other currency risks as described under effect of currency on results of operations 
we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements in order to limit our exposure to increases in interest rates 
these contracts are more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
the market value of these contracts as at december  and was negative million and negative million  respectively 
based on our agreements outstanding at december   a basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of million  as compared with million at december  conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates would result in a million net reduction in the net aggregate market value of these instruments  as compared with million at december  any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the variable rate debt they hedge were prematurely settled 
we have designated certain of our swiss franc debt as a hedge of our net investments 
a sensitivity analysis to changes in the us dollar on such debt at december  indicates that if the us dollar weakened by against the swiss franc  the fair value of such debt would increase by million  as compared with million at december  any foreign exchange translation gains and losses arising from debt qualifying as a non derivative hedging instrument are recorded in comprehensive income and offset the impact on comprehensive income of foreign exchange translation gains and losses related to the hedged net investments 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  revenue  pensions and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
retirement plans 
pension and post retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions in actuarial valuations 
these assumptions include discount rate and expected return on plan assets 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
while management believes the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense 
in  we adjusted the expected long term rate of return on us pension plan assets to down from  and adjusted the discount rate used for all us pension and post retirement plans to from 
in april  we froze our us pension plan and discontinued our us retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees 
consequently  no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans 
as a net result of these changes  consolidated recurring pension and post retirement expense in is expected to decrease by approximately million 
in december  we made a million payment to reduce the underfunded status of the us pension plan 
however  if the equity markets continue recent trends  we could be required to make additional cash funding payments or adjust the million additional minimum pension liability recorded at december  inventory 
we record our inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the estimated market value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  reductions in the value of inventory may be required 
excess and obsolete reserves are established based on forecast usage  orders and technological obsolescence 
acquired intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect management s assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in  provisions were made for us income taxes on certain undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries as a decision was made to repatriate these earnings rather than permanently reinvest them 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title to a product has transferred and any significant customer obligations have been fulfilled 
other than a few small software applications  mettler toledo does not sell its software products without the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the instrument 
the company s typical solution requires no significant production  modification or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products 
revenues from service contracts are recognized ratably over the contract period

the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  forward looking statements and associated risks this annual report includes forward looking statements based on our current expectations and projections about future events  including strategic plans  potential growth  including penetration of developed markets and opportunities in emerging markets  planned research and development efforts  product introductions and innovation  meeting customer expectations  planned operational changes  including productivity improvements  future financial performance  including expected capital expenditures  research and development expenditures  potential acquisitions  impact of completed acquisitions  future cash sources and requirements  liquidity  impact of environmental costs  and potential cost savings 
these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including those identified in exhibit to our annual report on form k  which could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical results or those anticipated and certain of which are beyond our control 
the words believe  expect  anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors  nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results
