overview learning tree is a leading worldwide vendor independent provider of training to information technology it professionals and managers working in business and government organizations 
since its founding in  learning tree has provided high quality training to over million it professionals and managers 
in fiscal  learning tree provided training to over  course participants 
approximately two thirds of learning tree participants come from fortune level companies  their international equivalents and government organizations  and approximately one third come from small and medium size companies 
learning tree offers a broad  proprietary library of intensive four and five day instructor led courses  comprising different course titles representing over  hours of training at september  learning tree courses focus on web development  operating systems  programming languages  databases  computer networks  computer and network security  object oriented technology  management and key business skills 
as a leading vendor independent provider of it training  learning tree designs its own courses to provide participants an unbiased perspective of software and hardware products and the ability to compare and integrate multiple platforms and technologies from various vendors in a single course 
learning tree uses a well defined  systematic approach in developing and updating its course library to provide training that is immediately relevant to course participants working in a broad range of applications and industries 
learning tree s proprietary course development process also allows it to customize its courses for delivery at its customers sites 
learning tree courses are highly interactive and are translated into french  swedish and japanese 
learning tree s courses are recommended for one to two semester hours of college credit by the american council on education  and are accepted for college credit at the university of phoenix 
in addition  learning tree is on the 
table of contents national association of state boards of accountancy national registry of cpe sponsors and is a registered education provider of the project management institute pmi 
learning tree offers its proprietary courses through local operations in the united states  united kingdom  france  canada  sweden and japan  and generates approximately half of its revenue internationally 
each learning tree operating subsidiary is staffed by local nationals responsible for the sale and delivery of learning tree courses in that country 
learning tree s infrastructure and logistical capabilities allow it to coordinate  plan and deliver its courses at learning tree s education centers  hotel and conference facilities and customer sites worldwide 
during fiscal  learning tree presented courses in countries 
since its founding in  learning tree has experienced a number of periods of challenging economic conditions 
learning tree has generally tried to use those periods to grow its market share so that it would be able to achieve even stronger growth during the better economic times that followed 
learning tree is confident in the long term outlook for the it industry and the need for it training because it believes that the core growth drivers for it and for its business remain unchanged 
in our knowledge economy  learning tree believes that it is itself a primary driver for productivity and product improvements that fuel growth 
as a result  learning tree believes that it provides mission critical resources that can be used by every organization to gain a competitive advantage 
learning tree believes that its business will continue to be influenced by world events  by the economy and by spending trends in the corporate marketplace for it 
further  some industries and companies served by learning tree may have been investing heavily in it immediately prior to the recent economic downturn 
thus  their future spending on it and training may not recover as quickly as the overall economy 
the timing of a recovery in spending on it training remains uncertain and learning tree has seen no sustained improvement in demand from its customers 
until the it training industry begins to improve  learning tree believes it is prudent to operate its business based on the assumption that future quarterly revenues could continue at lower levels  at least during the early parts of fiscal see exhibit  risk factors 
learning tree has structured its business so that the majority of course costs are variable and depend primarily upon the number of course events conducted 
learning tree schedules its course events throughout the year based on its assessment of demand 
since learning tree s instructors typically work full time in the it industry and teach learning tree course events as needed  learning tree s instructor related costs are largely variable 
learning tree s expenses associated with its own education centers are largely fixed 
however  learning tree can moderate its overall facility expenses to some extent by varying its use of rented hotel and conference facilities 
in addition  learning tree has the ability to control some of its expenses  based on its expectations of future customer demand and other factors  by adjusting the number of new course titles it develops and the size of its direct mailing campaigns 
during fiscal  learning tree continued to manage worldwide staffing levels to reflect revenue expectations  and continued to refine its marketing programs for improved effectiveness  which allowed it to reduce the magnitude of its sales and marketing expenditures 
at the same time  learning tree continued its efforts to improve its procedures for course scheduling with the goal of improving attendees per event  and thus revenue per event  at its courses 
as learning tree enters its th year  it is continuing to focus on enhancing quality levels in its core strengths its expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms and worldwide course delivery systems 
learning tree s course participants evaluations of the quality of its instructors and courses during fiscal again resulted in record customer satisfaction ratings 
during the year  learning tree completed the worldwide roll out of its proprietary magnalearn instructional enhancement system which its attendees credit with making it easier and faster for them to absorb information and complex concepts 

table of contents learning tree had been engaged in limited development and testing of internet based e learning course formats and packages 
however  learning tree was unable to find what it believed could be a profitable and sustainable e learning business model 
as a result  during the second quarter of fiscal  learning tree terminated its e learning development program 
see exhibit  risk factors 
results of operations the following table summarizes learning tree s consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses course development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal  learning tree s revenues decreased by to million from million in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million versus million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal revenues 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to a decline in the number of course participants 
during fiscal  learning tree trained a total of  effective course participants  a decrease of from the prior year s  participants 
learning tree believes that the sluggishness in the it industry has resulted in continued year over year declines in spending on it training 
for fiscal  revenues reflect a increase in average revenue per attendee 
approximately of the improvement was due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
accordingly  exchange rate fluctuations impact both learning tree s reported revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
see exhibit  risk factors 
the remaining improvement was primarily due to an increase in the proportion of course participants using training vouchers compared to those using training passports 
training vouchers are discounted less from list prices than training passports 
cost of revenues 
learning tree s cost of revenues primarily includes the costs of course instructors and their travel and living expenses  course materials and equipment  freight  classroom facilities and refreshments 
the cost of revenues for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in the number of course events during fiscal during fiscal  learning tree presented  effective course events compared to  events in fiscal the decrease in 
table of contents the cost of revenues also reflects the effect of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures 
these savings were partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rate changes 
the gross margin percentage was not significantly affected by the changes in exchange rates since such changes also increased fiscal revenues by a similar percentage 
in fiscal  the cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal in fiscal  excluding the impact of exchange rates  the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues reflects a decrease in average revenue per event and a increase in the average cost per event compared to fiscal the decrease in average revenue per event reflects a lower average number of attendees per event  partially offset by the increase in average revenue per attendee discussed above 
learning tree believes that the decrease in the average number of attendees per event primarily reflects the current economic conditions in the it industry  which lowered learning tree s overall attendance rate 
the increase in the average cost per event primarily reflects the impact of the reduced utilization of learning tree s education centers  course equipment and other fixed costs which were spread over fewer events  partially offset by learning tree s cost reduction and control measures  including the adjustment of staffing  the continued negotiation of supplier costs  the decrease of software costs and less course equipment depreciation 
course development expenses 
learning tree maintains a disciplined process to develop new courses and update its existing courses 
the costs incurred in that process  principally for internal product development staff and for subject matter experts  are expensed when incurred  and are included in course development expenses 
course development expenses also included all costs of learning tree s e learning development activities 
in fiscal  course development expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal course development expenses as a percentage of revenues  reflect a reduction in absolute expenditures on course development compared to fiscal  partially offset by the effect of the decline in revenues 
course development expenses decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the reduction in course development expenditures primarily reflects cost reductions realized in author related expenses  personnel costs  and the termination of the e learning development program in the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  learning tree released additional course titles on topics such as risk management  microsoft operations manager  
net development  java programming  crystal reports  windows server  network vulnerability assessment and defense  oracle ias  mysql  windows server and exchange server learning tree is currently developing new titles in the areas of management  sms and wireless wifi networking 
at the end of fiscal  learning tree offered different course titles  comprising over  hours of training  compared to titles a year earlier 
the decrease in the number of titles in fiscal reflects the net effect of introducing new titles and retiring titles 
in general  titles are retired when the profits they generate are not sufficient to justify the ongoing cost of marketing them and maintaining their technological content 
learning tree expects to have approximately course titles in the first quarter of fiscal the actual number of course titles that learning tree will produce  and their delivery dates  are subject to the rate of new technological developments and perceived customer demand 
thus  learning tree may or may not develop more titles than it retires in any period 
course development costs may increase in the future if learning tree expands its course library 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses include salaries  commissions and travel related costs for sales and marketing personnel  the costs of designing  producing and distributing direct mail marketing and media advertisements and the costs of information systems to support these activities 

table of contents for fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal the improvement resulted from absolute reductions in sales and marketing expenditures  which more than offset the effect of the decline in revenues 
during fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased by to million from million in fiscal the reduction in sales and marketing expenses primarily reflects the results of initiatives to adjust marketing expenditures and sales staffing  based on current operating levels  as well as lower selling commissions 
learning tree generally has the ability to adjust its expenditures for sales and marketing depending on its expectations of future customer demand  market conditions  strategic objectives and other factors 
however  if learning tree s expectations prove to be wrong  any significant revenue shortfall would have a material adverse effect on learning tree s results of operations 
general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflects learning tree s cost reduction and control measures  including reduced staffing levels  as well as a reduction in bad debt expense 
these improvements were partially offset by the effects of changes in exchange rates 
other income expense 
other income expense is primarily comprised of interest income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
in fiscal  other income expense decreased to million of income from million in fiscal primarily because of  lower interest income which was partially offset by foreign exchange gains 
the decrease in interest income reflects lower interest rates together with the decline in the amount of learning tree s interest bearing investments because of expenditures for repurchases of its common stock 
learning tree recorded foreign exchange gains of  in fiscal compared to foreign exchange losses of  in fiscal these gains and losses arose from receivables and payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of learning tree s foreign subsidiaries 
income taxes 
in fiscal  learning tree s income tax provision decreased to million from million in fiscal  as a result of lower taxable income and changes in deferred taxes 
learning tree operates as a holding company with operating subsidiaries in several countries 
each subsidiary is taxed based on the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates 
since taxes are incurred at the subsidiary level  and tax rates vary from country to country and one subsidiary s tax losses cannot offset the taxable income of subsidiaries in other tax jurisdictions  learning tree s consolidated effective tax rate may vary 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic segments 
learning tree has education centers in six countries around the world  and has historically derived approximately half of its revenues from outside the united states 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal reflects decreased revenues in all locations  except france  where the effect of changes in exchange rates more than offset the decrease in revenues in local currency 
the united states recorded revenues of approximately million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal revenues from europe were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  due to declines in the united kingdom and sweden 
canada recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to revenues of million in fiscal  and asia recorded revenues of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
although learning tree s consolidated financial statements are stated in us dollars  several of learning tree s subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
gains and losses arising from the translation of the balance sheets of learning tree s subsidiaries from the functional currencies to us dollars are 
table of contents reported as an adjustment to stockholders equity 
fluctuations in exchange rates may also have an effect on learning tree s results of operations 
since both revenues and expenses are generally denominated in the subsidiary s local currency  changes in exchange rates that have an adverse effect on learning tree s foreign revenues are partially offset by a favorable effect on learning tree s foreign expenses 
the impact of future exchange rates on learning tree s results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates and therefore continues to be subject to such risks 
in the future  learning tree may undertake such transactions 
there can be no assurance that any hedging techniques implemented by learning tree would be successful in eliminating or reducing the effects of currency fluctuations 
see exhibit  risk factors 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in fiscal  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
learning tree believes that these statements will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
fiscal compared with fiscal in fiscal  learning tree s revenues decreased by to million from million in fiscal income from operations for fiscal was million versus million in fiscal net income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal revenues 
the decrease in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in the number of course participants 
during fiscal  learning tree trained a total of  course participants  a decrease of from the prior year s  participants 
learning tree believes that the decrease in the number of course participants was primarily the result of the slowdown in the it industry and the overall economy  which resulted in more cautious spending by its customers on it training 
for fiscal  revenues reflected a decrease in average revenue per course participant primarily because of a larger portion of course participants attending under multiple course discount programs compared to the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  exchange rate fluctuations did not have a significant effect on revenues because the impact of adverse changes in foreign exchange rates in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year were offset by improvements in foreign exchange rates in the second half of the fiscal year 
cost of revenues 
the cost of revenues for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal this decrease reflected a decrease in the number of course events during fiscal  partially offset by a increase in cost per event compared to fiscal during fiscal  learning tree presented  course events compared to  events in fiscal in fiscal  the cost of revenues increased to of revenues compared to in fiscal the change in gross profitability of learning tree s courses primarily reflected a decrease in revenue per event compared to the prior year 
revenue per event primarily reflected a decrease in the average number of attendees per event 
in addition  revenue per event reflected the aforementioned decrease in average revenue per attendee 
learning tree believes that the decrease in the average number of attendees per event primarily reflected the impact of the economic conditions  which lowered learning tree s overall attendance rates 
the change in learning tree s gross profitability also reflected a increase in learning tree s average cost per event 
the increase in the average cost per event primarily reflected the impact of the lower utilization of learning tree s education centers arising from the decrease in the number of course events conducted in fiscal  as well as the impact of other fixed costs being spread over fewer events 
the increase was partially offset by reduced spending on instructor training and recruiting and a reduction in the use of rented hotel and conference facilities 

table of contents course development expenses 
in fiscal  course development expenses were of revenues compared to in fiscal course development expenses as a percentage of revenues  reflected lower revenues  partly offset by a decline in absolute expenditures on course development 
course development expenses decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal this decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the number of new course titles developed during fiscal while maintaining the level of expenditures for updating existing courses 
during slower economic periods  it hardware and software vendors typically introduce fewer new products  thus requiring the development of fewer new it courses 
in addition  the reduction in course development expenses reflected a decrease in spending on e learning development

general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses primarily reflected the effect of learning tree s cost reduction and control measures  partially offset by an increase in it staff and related expenses  and staff salary adjustments 
other income expense 
in fiscal  other income expense decreased to million of income from million in fiscal primarily because of million lower interest income which was partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in interest income reflected lower interest rates together with the decline in the amount of learning tree s interest bearing investments because of expenditures for repurchases of its common stock

table of contents historically  learning tree s quarterly operating results have fluctuated  and that is expected to continue in the future 
the fluctuations may be caused by many factors such as the frequency and availability of course events  the number of weeks in a quarter during which courses can be conducted  the timing  timely delivery  frequency and size of  and response to learning tree s direct mail marketing and advertising campaigns  the timing of the introduction of new course titles  the mix between course events held at customer sites and course events held in learning tree s education centers and hotels  competitive forces within current and anticipated future markets served by learning tree  learning tree s ability to attract customers and meet their expectations  currency fluctuations and other risks inherent in international operations  natural disasters  external strikes  acts of war or terrorism and other external factors  and general economic conditions and industry specific slowdowns 
fluctuations in quarter to quarter results may also occur as a result of differences in the timing of learning tree s spending on development and marketing of its courses and receiving revenues from its customers 
see exhibit  risk factors 
learning tree s quarterly revenues and income typically reflect seasonal patterns 
generally  learning tree s revenue and operating income are greater in the second half of its fiscal year april through september than in the first half october through march 
this is due in large part to seasonal spending patterns of learning tree s customers  which are affected by  among other things  matters such as their budgetary considerations  factors specific to their business or industry  and weather  holiday and vacation considerations 
however  the effects of periods of rapid acceleration or deceleration of revenues can offset these seasonal effects 
there can be no assurance that these seasonal factors or their effects will remain the same in the future 
liquidity and capital resources learning tree s cash and cash equivalents decreased to million at september   from million at september  this decrease reflects repurchases of learning tree s common stock and investment in equipment and facilities  partially offset by cash from operations and the favorable effect of exchange rates on cash 
during fiscal  learning tree repurchased approximately  shares of its common stock for approximately million 
learning tree may make additional purchases through open market transactions  but has no commitments to do so 
cash provided by operations for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal however  cash from operations in fiscal was reduced by the payment of million for stock that had been repurchased at the end of fiscal after eliminating the effect of these stock repurchases on accounts payable  cash provided by operations in fiscal was approximately million compared to the million provided this fiscal year 
thus  the decrease in cash from operations in fiscal primarily reflects lower profitability and reductions in advance payments by customers for future courses 
these changes were partially offset by the effect of the million stock repurchase at the end of fiscal on fiscal cash from operations and lower income tax payments in fiscal at september   learning tree had a net working capital balance of million 
during fiscal  learning tree invested million in equipment and facilities compared to million in fiscal the investments in the current year primarily relate to purchases of course equipment 
the higher level of investments during fiscal was primarily related to purchases of course equipment and the build out of a second education center in paris  france  which opened in the third quarter of fiscal although learning tree expects to continue to invest in additional equipment in fiscal  learning tree had no material future purchase obligations  capital commitments or debt as of september  accordingly  learning tree believes its cash and cash equivalents and the cash provided by its operations will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 

table of contents in the future  learning tree may use cash for acquisitions 
while learning tree has no current agreements in place or negotiations underway with respect to any acquisition  learning tree may  on occasion  evaluate acquisition opportunities that appear to fit within its overall business strategy 
see exhibit  risk factors 
learning tree has not paid any cash dividends since its inception and does not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations is based upon learning tree s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following list of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of learning tree s accounting policies 
learning tree s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following represents a summary of learning tree s critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that learning tree believes are the most important to the portrayal of learning tree s financial condition and results of operations  and or require management s significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
course events range from three to five days  with an average of approximately four days 
for individual course enrollments  it is learning tree s policy to recognize revenues and the related direct costs of course events as courses are delivered on a straight line basis 
however  for administrative purposes  the revenues and the related costs of course events are recorded upon commencement of each course event  unless the difference between learning tree s revenue recognition policy and recording revenues and related course costs on a straight line basis is more than inconsequential 

table of contents learning tree offers its customers a multiple course sales discount referred to as a training passport 
a training passport allows an individual passport holder to attend up to a specified number of learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
for a training passport  the amount of revenue recognized for each attendance in one of learning tree s courses is based upon the selling price of the training passport  the list price of the course taken and the estimated average number of courses passport holders will actually attend 
upon expiration of a training passport  learning tree records the difference  if any  between the revenues previously recognized and the training passport selling price 
the estimated attendance rate is based upon the historical experience of the average actual number of course events that training passport holders have been attending 
the average actual attendance rate for all expired training passports has closely approximated the estimated rate utilized by learning tree 
if the training passport attendance rates change  the revenue recognition rate for all active training passports and for all training passports sold thereafter is adjusted 
learning tree believes it is appropriate to recognize revenues on this basis in order to more closely match revenue and related costs  as the substantial majority of its passport holders do not attend the maximum number of course events permitted under their training passport 
learning tree believes that the use of historical data is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the average actual number of course events attended by the tens of thousands of passport holders since the inception of the program in fiscal although learning tree has seen no material changes in the historical rates as the number of course titles has changed  it monitors such potential effects 
in general  determining the estimated average number of course events that will be attended by a training passport holder is based on historical trends that may not continue in the future 
these estimates could differ in the near term from amounts used in arriving at the reported revenue 
learning tree also offers a multiple course sales discount referred to as training vouchers 
under learning tree s training vouchers  the customer buys the right to send a specified number of attendees to learning tree courses over a one year period for a fixed price 
revenue is recognized on a pro rata basis for each attendance 
if a training voucher expires unused  learning tree records the selling price of the expired training voucher as revenue 
prepaid marketing expenses 
prepaid marketing expenses are charged to income in the month in which the advertising materials are mailed since the benefit period for such costs is short and the amount of such future benefit is not practically measurable 
course development costs 
course development costs are charged to operations in the period incurred 
stock based compensation 
learning tree uses the intrinsic value method under apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for its stock option plans 
the exercise price of all stock options granted under learning tree s stock option plans was equal to their fair market value at the dates of the grants 
accordingly  no compensation cost was recognized for stock options granted to employees during fiscal  and foreign currency 
learning tree translates the financial statements of its foreign subsidiaries from the local functional currencies to united states dollars in accordance with sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
the rates of exchange at each fiscal year end are used for translating the balance sheets and the average monthly rates of exchange for each year are used for the statements of operations 
gains or losses arising from the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as a separate component of stockholders equity 
gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
to date  learning tree has not sought to hedge the risk associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  and therefore continues to be subject to such risk 

table of contents facilities  intangible and other long lived assets 
learning tree periodically reviews the carrying value of its facilities  intangible and other long lived assets to identify and assess any impairment of the carrying value 
income taxes 
learning tree applies sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  in accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities arise from carryforwards and from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the book basis of such assets and liabilities as reported in the financial statements 
deferred income tax assets arise from expected reductions in taxes payable in future periods 
deferred tax assets reflect management s estimate of the amounts that will be realized from future profitability and can be predicted with reasonable certainty 
deferred income tax liabilities represent taxes that learning tree expects to pay in future periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
outlook for fiscal throughout this document  there have been various forward looking statements 
however  all of the statements in this section are forward looking and are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including those detailed from time to time in learning tree s filings with the securities and exchange commission and in exhibit  risk factors 
as economic and market conditions may change at any time  learning tree s future revenues  plans and expenditures will vary from the observations below  and these differences may be material 
backlog 
at september   learning tree s backlog of million was about higher than it had been on september  at october   learning tree had a backlog of million  which represented a increase compared to the backlog of million at october  only a portion of learning tree s backlog is funded 
there can be no assurance that orders comprising the backlog will be realized as revenue 
recent trends 
learning tree believes that its business will continue to be influenced by world events  by the economy and by spending trends in the corporate marketplace for it 
further  some industries and companies served by learning tree may have been investing heavily in it immediately prior to the recent economic downturn 
thus  their future spending on it and training may not recover as quickly as the overall economy 
the timing of a recovery in spending on it training remains uncertain and learning tree has seen no sustained improvement in demand from its customers 
until the it training industry begins to improve  learning tree believes it is prudent to operate its business based on the assumption that future quarterly revenues could continue at lower levels  at least during the early parts of fiscal as learning tree enters its th year  it is continuing to focus on enhancing quality levels in its core strengths its expert instructors  proprietary content library  state of the art classrooms and worldwide course delivery systems 
learning tree s course participants evaluations of the quality of its instructors and courses during fiscal again resulted in record customer satisfaction ratings 
during the year  learning tree completed the worldwide roll out of its proprietary magnalearn instructional enhancement system which its attendees credit with making it easier and faster for them to absorb information and complex concepts 
effect of exchange rates 
approximately half of learning tree s business is conducted in currencies other than us dollars and fluctuations in exchange rates will affect future revenues and expenses when translated into dollars 
if current exchange rates remain stable through the remainder of fiscal  learning tree s revenues would be favorably affected by approximately in the first quarter and approximately for the full fiscal year compared to the corresponding periods in fiscal conversely  learning tree s foreign currency denominated expenses would be unfavorably affected by similar percentages in these periods
