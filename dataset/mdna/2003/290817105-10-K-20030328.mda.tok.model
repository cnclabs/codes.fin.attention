these leases were fully paid during and the company currently has no capital leases on its balance sheet 
management expects to continue to rely principally on the use of internally generated funds to finance the cost of additional inovoject systems in  as was the case in critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates including but not limited to those related to accounts receivable warranties inventory obsolescence deferred tax assets the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are material to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable to date  the company has not experienced any material accounts receivable collection issues 
however  based on a review of cumulative balances  industry experience and the current economic environment  the company currently reserves from to of accounts receivable  depending on whether the receivable is denominated in us dollars or a foreign currency  of our outstanding trade accounts receivable balance as an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
the consolidated balance for uncollectible accounts as of december  was  warranties to date  the company has not experienced nor does it expect to experience any material inovoject system or product warranty issues in excess of amounts reserved 
however  based on sales of inovoject systems and products the company has established a reserve for future claims 
the consolidated balance for warranties as of december  was  inventory obsolescence to date  the company has not experienced any material inventory obsolescence 
however  based on a percentage of the current product and inovoject part inventory levels the company has established a reserve against future inovoject parts obsolescence due to technological improvements and limited shelf life of product inventories 
the consolidated balance for product and parts obsolescence as of december  was  deferred tax assets the company records deferred tax assets to amounts that are likely to be realized 
based on the company s recent profitability and belief that will result in an overall profit  the company has recorded deferred tax assets of  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
however  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize its net recorded deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
effect of inflation management expects cost of product sales and inovoject systems revenues  operating expenses and capital equipment costs to change in line with periodic inflationary changes in price levels 
while management generally believes that the company will be able to offset the effect of price level changes by adjusting selling lease prices and effecting operating efficiencies  any material unfavorable changes in price levels could have a material adverse affect on its results of operations
