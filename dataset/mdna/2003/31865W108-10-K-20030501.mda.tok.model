continued depressed conditions in the aviation industry  as well as depressed overall economic conditions  will have an adverse impact on the company s future results 
the impact of changes in fuel and other freight related costs 
fuel is a significant cost in the aviation industry and increases in the cost of fuel or lack of availability of fuel could have an adverse impact on overall flight activity levels  and the company s business 
relationships with its customers 
an inability to maintain good relationships with its customers  or the inability to expand by establishing relationships with new customers  could have an adverse impact on the company 
the ability of the company s customers to meet their financial obligations to the company

amounts in millions  except share amounts  and where specifically noted 
general the company is one of the premier suppliers of products and services to the aerospace industry worldwide  including the provisioning of aircraft parts and components  and supply chain management services 
the company also builds custom hose assemblies  and performs overhaul and repair services for brakes and starters generators 
the loss incurred by the company for the year ended january  principally was the result of non cash charges taken by the company  thus there was no effect upon the company s liquidity 
the company continues to maintain a large cash position and a strong balance sheet 
with some indices indicating that activity in the industry is down or more over prior year levels  the company believes that its results show that it continues to take market share from its competitors  especially from less financially stable competitors 
results for the three months and year ended january  continued to be adversely impacted by the poor state of the economy  and especially by the recession in the aerospace industry that began in late and increased after the terrorist acts that occurred on september  recovery in the industry has been minimal  and overall business activity in the aerospace industry continues to be depressed  especially in the general aviation and commercial airline sectors 
flight training schools have significantly reduced their operations  and certain flight zones remain restricted for general aviation flights 
bankruptcies have and continue to occur in the industry 
as a result of these events  during the quarter ended january   the company re assessed its reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable and took a million charge to increase its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company expects that the current level of reduced business activity in the industry will continue  and the timing of any recovery in the industry is uncertain 
the company continues to look for new sources of revenue  to control its costs  and expand its offering of products and services 
during the quarter ended january  the company  due to the loss incurred for the year  and in accordance with requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for income taxes  recorded a non cash deferred income tax charge of million to establish a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets 
the establishment of the valuation allowance is not a reflection of the future or long term profitability of the company  and the company expects that it will reverse in future years if financial results increase sufficiently to support the value of the assets 
on july   the company announced that it had entered into a multi year contract with gulfstream aerospace corporation for the provision of supply chain management services  effective july  net sales from this contract favorably impacted results beginning in the quarter ended october  during the first quarter ended april   the company adopted fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to fas  goodwill is not amortized but is tested periodically for impairment using discounted cash flows and other fair value methodologies 
upon adoption of fas  the company was required to perform transitional impairment tests relating to its goodwill existing as of february   the date of adoption 
as a result  upon adoption of fas  the company took a one time  non cash charge of  net of applicable income tax benefit of  or per share  to write off the carrying value of its goodwill 
no charge was required under previous generally accepted accounting principles  which were based upon undiscounted cash flows 
the adoption of fas represented a change in accounting principle  and the cumulative effect  net of the applicable income tax benefit  has been shown on a separate line in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies the company is required to provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires the use of judgments  estimates and assumptions to determine the measurement of revenues and expenses  and the realizable value of certain assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the best information available at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
the estimates and assumptions could change significantly as conditions within and beyond management s control change 
therefore  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates 
the most significant estimates made in preparing the company s financial statements include revenue recognition  the determination of the allowance for doubtful trade receivables  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred income tax asset valuations  the valuation of goodwill  and  in prior years  estimates made relating to discontinued operations  including the determination of the amount of gain or loss upon disposition 
the following is a discussion of the critical accounting policies and the related judgments  estimates and assumptions utilized in preparing the company s consolidated financial statements 
a summary of significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition the company s net sales consist of sales of products and services  including parts and components  component overhaul and repair services  and supply chain management services 
net sales are recorded when parts and components are shipped and title transfers to the customer  when overhauled and repaired items are completed and shipped back to the customer  or when supply chain management services have been provided to the customer 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales 
the terms and nature of supply chain management services provided are stipulated in a long term contract between the company and the customer 
in providing services where the company distributes parts and components on behalf of its customer  the company may use its own inventory or hold its customers inventory without taking ownership of such inventory 
in cases where the company does not take ownership of its customers inventory  net sales are recognized as a fee based on the sales value of the product shipped through the company s facilities throughput  and not the sales value of the product itself 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful trade receivables is established based on estimates of the amount of uncollectible trade receivables  utilizing financial formulas based principally upon historical experience  the credit worthiness of the customer  the age of the account  the estimated risk that the account can be collected  and specific identification 
collection of trade receivables is affected by aviation industry and market trends  overall economic trends and conditions  and customers credit issues and financial condition 
changes in any of these factors may have a significant negative impact upon the estimated allowance  and the company s financial performance 
allowance for excess and obsolete inventories inventories generally consist of aircraft parts and components  and are valued at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
provisions are made in each period for the estimated effect of excess and obsolete inventories based upon financial formulas that take into account quantities  costs  the age of the inventory on hand  historical and projected sales  and other inventory movements  adjusted for known or estimated factors such as new product lines and product return allowances 
actual excess and obsolete inventories may differ significantly from such estimates  and such differences could have a significant negative impact on the estimated allowance  and the company s financial performance 
goodwill goodwill arises from the excess of the purchase price paid over the underlying fair value of assets acquired in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
goodwill was recognized upon first aviation s acquisition of api s business in and upon the acquisition of superior s distribution business in a significant amount of judgment is used to estimate the fair value of assets acquired and to allocate the purchase price to the underlying assets and liabilities  including the recognition of liabilities incurred directly as a result of the acquisition 
most of the assumptions and estimates utilized in this process were based upon known factors and exposures  historical information and management s experience 
deferred income tax assets the company uses the liability method to account for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are estimated using the enacted tax rates and laws that are estimated to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of the assets is subject to estimates and judgments  and may change based upon a variety of factors  including future profitability of the company and tax law changes 
if an asset is not deemed more likely than not to be fully realizable  a valuation allowance must be established against all or part of the asset 
in addition  fas requires the establishment of a valuation allowance under certain conditions 
discontinued operations upon the sale or disposition of a subsidiary  management estimates what it believes to be costs to be incurred upon and after the sale or disposal of the subsidiary  including income taxes that relate directly to the sale or disposal transaction  or the operations of the former entity 
such estimates are subject to change  and the changes may be significant 
new accounting pronouncements during the year ended january   the company adopted fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under fas  an impairment loss must be recognized when the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
in the event that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may be impaired  an assessment of recoverability must be performed 
the assessment process consists of comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write down is required 
if this review process indicates that the asset will not be recoverable  the carrying value of the asset must be reduced to its estimated realizable value 
the adoption of fas had no effect on the consolidated financial position of the company 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentages of the company s net sales that certain income and expense items represent 
year ended january  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses corporate expenses litigation income income loss from operations interest income interest and other expenses income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operation gain from dispositions of subsidiaries cumulative effect of accounting change net income loss year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales net sales for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  net sales decreased principally as a result of depressed economic and industry conditions  and continued additional security measures that especially affected the commercial airline and general aviation markets  including flight training schools 
the result was significantly less flight activity and therefore less requirements for parts and components 
in addition  as a result of economic and industry conditions  the company previously had tightened its credit policies  and this further contributed to the decline in sales 
price reductions by competitors seeking to maintain and or regain market share have and are expected to continue to adversely affect the rate of growth and profit margins in the near term  as will adverse industry conditions 
the majority of the decrease in sales occurred in the us market  but continued weakness in asia and latin america  due to economic weakness in those areas  also negatively impacted sales 
canada and europe experienced sales growth 
partially offsetting the decline in sales of parts and components was an increase in sales relating to supply chain management contracts  due to new customers and expanded service offerings 
however  as these contracts often are based upon a fee relative to the services provided  the impact on sales is less than if the company was selling the product itself 
however  since the company s investment in its personnel  facilities and systems are scalable  as services contracts increase throughput they will have the effect of decreasing the company s overall per unit costs  and increasing efficiencies 
the company expects to continue to expand into new markets  especially internationally  add additional product lines  and invest in new product offerings 
the company also continues to seek new customers and opportunities in its supply chain management business 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of costs of inventory sold  direct costs to overhaul and repair parts and components  and direct costs of providing services 
freight costs also are included in cost of sales 
costs of sales for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the decrease in cost of sales is consistent with the decrease in net sales 
in addition  the decrease in cost of sales was impacted by a shift in mix toward more supply chain management services contracts  which have a higher margin  as described below under gross profit 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  gross margin increased to from 
the decline in gross profit was due principally to the decrease in net sales  due to the reasons described above under net sales 
offsetting this decrease  which also was the reason for the increase in the gross margin  was an increase in gross profit from services contracts  which have a higher gross margin  as explained below 
a significant portion of the costs relating to services contracts are indirect costs  including indirect personnel  warehouse and related  and systems  and these costs are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
therefore  gross margins for services sales will be higher than for product sales 
as net sales of services increase  the trend of increased gross profit and gross margin from the current year compared to the prior year will continue  along with smaller increases in selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended january   gross profit from services sales doubled that of the prior year 
services contracts are part of a continuum of product lines offered by the company to its customers  and represent a growth opportunity for the company 
the company considers its business to be distributing parts and components and providing services to manage and or distribute its customers parts and components 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the increase is due principally to increased charges for estimated bad debts  and an increase in indirect costs related to services contracts 
as stated in gross profit  indirect costs relating to services sales are classified as part of selling  general and administrative expenses 
as net sales from services increase  selling  general and administrative costs also will increase  though generally at a lower rate 
corporate expenses corporate expenses for the year ended january  decreased million to million from million for the year ended january  the reduction was due principally to less personnel related costs 
interest income and interest and other expenses interest income of million earned during the year ended january  was derived from investing the company s cash in short term investments 
the decrease from the million earned during the year ended january   was due principally to the marked decrease in interest rates from fiscal year to fiscal year interest and other expense of million for the year ended january  decreased from million for the year ended january   principally for the same reason 
provision benefit for income taxes for the first three quarters of the fiscal year ended january   the company s results showed pre tax income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
as a result of the pre tax loss incurred by the company in the fourth quarter  the company incurred a pre tax loss before the effect of the accounting change for the full fiscal year 
after considering this loss  the company had incurred a cumulative loss over the prior three years 
this cumulative loss triggered certain provisions under fas  that required the company to re evaluate its deferred income tax assets 
as a result  the company took a charge of million to establish a valuation allowance against its deferred income tax assets since  under the provisions of fas  a greater emphasis is placed on three year cumulative losses as an indicator of the company s ability to realize its deferred income tax assets than the potential for future income 
the requirement to establish the valuation allowance is not an indication of management s evaluation of the company s future or long term profitability  performance or financial condition of the company 
the valuation allowance will be reversed in future years if financial results increase sufficiently to support the value of the assets 
the difference between the effective rate for the year january  as compared to the statutory rate of is due principally to changes in the valuation allowance 
income loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change for the year ended january  the company incurred a loss of million from continuing operations  compared to income of million for the year ended january  the decrease in income principally was due to lower sales and gross profit  significant charges to increase the company s allowance for bad debts  and the charge taken to establish a valuation allowance against the company s deferred income tax assets 
cumulative effect of accounting change as previously described  during the year ended january   the company adopted fas and recorded a net charge of million upon adoption 
there was no accounting change during the year ended january  net income loss and net income loss per share the company incurred a net loss of million  or per share for the year ended january   as compared to net income of million  or per share for the year ended january  the net loss and decrease in net income principally were due to the reasons described above 
year ended january  compared to year ended january  net sales net sales for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  net sales increased principally as a result of a combination of factors  including growth in international operations  especially southeast asia and europe  increased domestic market share  especially in the commercial airline sector  the impact of the acquisition of superior s distribution business and growth in the company s logistics services business 
price reductions by competitors seeking to regain market share have and are expected to continue to adversely affect the rate of growth and profit margins in the near term  as will adverse industry conditions 
the company expects to continue to expand into new markets  add additional product lines  and invest in new product offerings 
the company also continues to seek new customers and opportunities in its logistics and inventory management business 
cost of sales costs of sales for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the increase in cost of sales was due to the increase in net sales and the reasons described below under gross profit 
gross profit gross profit for the year ended january  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  gross margin decreased to from 
the decline in gross margin also was due to a combination of factors  including competitive pressures  changes in product mix to lower margin sales in the airline and superior product lines  and an increase of million in inventory reserves 
the increase in inventory reserves was a result of the company s normal review procedures 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended january  the decrease is attributable to the company s overall focus on profitability and controlling costs  and a reduction in personnel costs due to the industry slowdown following the terrorists attacks last september 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended january  was a million charge relating to a change in the company s estimate of recording bad debts to a more conservative methodology 
corporate expenses corporate expenses for the year ended january  decreased million to million from million for the year ended january  the reduction was due principally to reduced other legal costs 
litigation income expense during the three months and year ended january  the company settled its litigation against gulf insurance company for a cash payment to the company of approximately million 
the litigation had been ongoing for several years 
the settlement  net of associated legal costs  has been reclassified out of corporate expenses and shown separately 
legal costs not associated with this litigation are classified in corporate expenses 
prior year legal costs  relating to this matter were reclassified out of corporate expenses and shown separately as well 
interest income and interest and other expenses interest income of million earned during the year ended january  was derived from investing the company s cash in short term investments 
the decrease from the million earned during the year ended january  was due principally to the marked decrease in interest rates from fiscal year to fiscal year interest expense and other of million for the year ended january  decreased from million for the year ended january  for the same reason 
provision benefit for income taxes the company recorded a provision for income taxes on income from continuing operations for the year ended january  of million  for an effective rate of 
for the year ended january   the company recorded a benefit on its loss from continuing operations of million  for an effective rate of 
the change in the effective rate for the year january  over the prior year was due to changes in estimates and the magnitude of permanent differences between book and taxable income or loss 
income loss from continuing operations for the year ended january  the company earned million from continuing operations  compared to a loss of million for the year ended january  the increase in income was due to growth in net sales and gross profit  lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  lower corporate expenses  due principally to decreased other legal costs  and the legal settlement with gulf insurance company  offset by an increase in inventory reserves  an increase in the provision for bad debts  and a decrease in net interest income for the year ended january  gain from dispositions of subsidiaries during the year ended january   the company reversed reserves related to the sale of nac and the disposal of aerov that no longer were required 
as a result  the company recorded income of million during the year ended january   after associated income taxes of million 
the income related principally to nac 
during the year ended january  the company finalized its income tax liabilities related to the sale of nac 
the difference between the estimated income tax liabilities and the actual liabilities incurred  a million credit  was recorded in the year ended january  offsetting this gain was the net loss on the disposal of aerov of million 
net income loss the company had net income of million for the year ended january   as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was due to the reasons described above 
net income loss per share no significant shares were repurchased during the year ended january  during the year ended january  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock 
the effect of these repurchases was to decrease the weighted average shares outstanding and increase the net loss per share by approximately per share for the year ended january  liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise principally from its working capital needs 
in addition  the company has liquidity requirements to fund capital expenditures to support its current operations  and facilitate growth and expansion 
the company funds its liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and from borrowings 
the company manages its cash and debt to minimize its interest expense 
cash and cash equivalents at any time may consist of a combination of demand deposits  money market or short term  high grade bond funds  and short term certificates of deposit 
the loss incurred by the company for the year ended january  principally was the result of non cash charges taken by the company  thus there was no effect upon the company s liquidity 
the company continues to maintain a large cash position and a strong balance sheet  which allowed us to pay the special cash dividend to stockholders in january 
the company s cash provided by used in operations for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations for the year ended january  was positively impacted by reductions in receivables and inventory  offset partially by a reduction in accounts payable 
the company has been reducing its inventory levels since the third quarter of the prior fiscal year when the company acquired the distribution business of superior  and a significant amount of inventory 
the company is focused on managing its overall working capital 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended january  includes million related to the acquisition of superior 
cash provided by used in financing activities for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended january  includes million to pay stockholders a special cash dividend of per share  and million to pay down long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in the prior year the company had borrowed cash to fund a portion of its acquisition of superior 
first aviation s aggregate cash used for capital expenditures  excluding the acquisition of superior  for the years ended january   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the decrease over the three years is due to the discontinuance of nac and aerov  and less capital requirements as a result of heavy spending in prior years to upgrade the company s systems and equipment to handle the company s growth and expansion 
for fiscal year the amount required for capital expenditures currently is expected to remain at approximately the same amount as for fiscal year management expects to fund these requirements from cash on hand  cash flows from operations  and from borrowings 
api has a million revolving line of credit through a commercial revolving loan and security agreement the facility 
borrowings under this facility bear interest equal to the libor rate plus and are limited to specified percentages of eligible trade receivables and inventories of api 
the facility contains a number of covenants  including restrictions on mergers  consolidations and acquisitions  the incurrence of indebtedness  transactions with affiliates  the creation of liens  and limitations on capital expenditures 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the facility  the payment of dividends on api s common stock is prohibited  except with the lender s consent  and api is required to maintain minimum levels of net worth and specified interest expense coverage ratios 
substantially all of api s domestic assets are pledged as collateral under the facility  and first aviation guarantees all borrowings under the facility 
borrowings under the facility were million at january   at an interest rate of approximately 
an additional total of approximately million was available to borrow under the facility at january  during the quarter ended july   api extended the maturity date of the facility to july  from july  the extension of the agreement was on the same terms and conditions as the prior facility 
as a result of the extension  borrowings under the facility continue to be classified as long term 
management believes that the carrying amount of the company s borrowings approximates fair market value because the interest rate is variable and resets frequently 
on january   the company announced that its board of directors  in light of the company s cash position  had approved a special cash dividend of per share 
the dividend was paid on january  the total paid was million 
the company previously had not declared nor paid any cash dividends or distributions on its common stock since its inception in at this time  the company anticipates that all future earnings will be retained for use in the company s business 
any payment of cash dividends in the future on the company s common stock will be dependent upon the company s financial condition  its results of operations  current and anticipated cash requirements  plans for expansion  the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise make cash payments or advances to it  and restrictions  if any  under any future debt obligations  as well as any other factors that the board of directors deems relevant 
based upon current and anticipated levels of operations  the company believes that its cash on hand and cash flow from operations  combined with borrowings available under its line of credit  will be sufficient to meet its current and anticipated cash operating requirements through the year ending january   including scheduled interest payments  working capital needs  capital expenditures and subsidiary preferred dividend requirements 
in a series of authorizations commencing november   the company s board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
the repurchases were funded from a portion of the proceeds from the sale of nac  and were made from time to time in open market transactions  block purchases  and privately negotiated transactions or otherwise at prices prevailing at the time of the repurchase
