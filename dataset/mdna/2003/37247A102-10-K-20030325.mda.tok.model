the company has elected to adopt sfas  effective april  during the fiscal year ended  december   the impact of this adoption resulted in the company recognizing a write off of approximately million of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the terminated credit facility which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to the requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  including those related to employee termination benefits and obligations under operating leases and other contracts  be recognized when the liability is incurred  and not necessarily the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  as under eitf sfas also establishes that the initial measurement of a liability recognized under sfas be based on fair value 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company adopted sfas  effective december for exit or disposal activities initiated prior to december   the company followed the accounting guidelines outlined in eitf in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize a liability  at the inception of the guarantee  for the fair value of obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee and also include more detailed disclosures with respect to guarantees 
fin is effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified starting january  and requires the additional disclosures in its interim and annual financial statements effective for the period ended december  the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of fin in fiscal and will adopt the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin effective january  the company does not expect that the provisions of fin will have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material impact on its results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition under fee for service agreements with patients and with commercial and certain government payors  net revenues are recorded based on net realizable amounts to be received in the period in which the services and products are provided or delivered 
under capitated arrangements with managed care customers  net revenues are recognized based on a predetermined monthly contractual rate for each member of the managed care plan regardless of the services provided 
under the pps for medicare reimbursement  net revenues are recorded based on a reimbursement rate which varies based on the severity of the patient s condition  service needs and certain other factors  revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which services are provided 
revenue is subject to adjustment during this period if there are significant changes in the patient s condition during the treatment period or if the patient is discharged but readmitted to another agency within the same day episodic period 
medicare billings under pps are initially recognized as deferred revenue and are subsequently amortized into revenue over an average patient treatment period 
the process for recognizing revenue under the medicare program is based on certain assumptions and judgments  including the average length of time of each treatment as compared to a standard day episode  the appropriateness of the clinical assessment of each patient at the time of certification and the level of adjustments to the fixed reimbursement rate relating to patients who receive a limited number of visits  have significant changes in condition or are subject to certain other factors during the episode 
deferred revenues of approximately million and million relating to the medicare pps program were included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december   respectively revenue adjustments result from differences between estimated and actual reimbursement amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
revenue adjustments are deducted from gross accounts receivable 
these revenue adjustments are based on significant assumptions and judgments which are determined by company management based on historical trends 
net revenues attributable to major payor sources of reimbursement are as follows fiscal year medicare medicaid and other government commercial insurance and other in addition  for fiscal years  and  cigna accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  of the company s total net revenues 
the company has renewed its contract with cigna for a seventh consecutive year  with the current contract expiring on december   with an option to renew 
net revenues generated under capitated agreements were approximately percent  percent  and percent of total net revenues for fiscal    respectively 
fee for service contracts with other commercial payors are traditionally one year in term and renewable automatically on an annual basis  unless terminated by either party 
collectibility of accounts receivable the process for estimating the ultimate collection of receivables  particularly with respect to fee for service arrangements  involves significant assumptions and judgments 
in this regard  the company has implemented a standardized approach to estimate and review the collectibility of its receivables based on accounts receivable aging trends 
historical collection and payor reimbursement experience is an integral part of the estimation process related to determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  the company assesses the current state of its billing functions in order to identify any known collection or reimbursement issues to determine the impact  if any  on its reserve estimates  which involve judgment 
revisions in reserve estimates are recorded as an adjustment to the provision for doubtful accounts which is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company believes that its collection and reserve processes  along with the monitoring of its billing processes  help to reduce the risk associated with material revisions to reserve estimates resulting from adverse changes in collection  reimbursement experience and billing functions 
cost of claims incurred but not reported under capitated arrangements with managed care customers  the company estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported based on applying actuarial assumptions  historical patterns of utilization to authorized levels of service  current enrollment statistics and other information 
in addition  under fee for service arrangements with certain managed care customers  the company also estimates the cost of claims incurred but not reported and the estimated revenue relating thereto in situations in which the company is responsible for care management and patient services are performed by a non affiliated provider 
the estimate of cost of claims incurred but not reported involves significant assumptions and judgments which relate to and may vary depending on the services authorized at each of the company s care management centers  historical patterns of service utilization and payment trends 
these assumptions and judgments are evaluated on a quarterly basis and changes in estimated liabilities for costs of claims incurred but not reported are determined based on such evaluation 
obligations under insurance programs the company is obligated for certain costs under various insurance programs  including employee health and welfare  workers compensation and professional liability 
the company may be subject to workers compensation claims and lawsuits alleging negligence or other similar legal claims 
the company maintains various insurance programs to cover this risk but is substantially self insured for most of these claims 
the company recognizes its obligations associated with these programs in the period the claim is incurred 
the cost of both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits  have generally been estimated based on historical data  industry statistics  current enrollment statistics and other information 
such estimates and the resulting reserves are reviewed and updated periodically 
for the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded a special charge of million relating primarily to a refinement in the estimation process used to determine the company s actuarially computed workers compensation and professional liability reserves 
in this regard  management believes it now has sufficient data to allow the company to more heavily rely on its own home health specific historical claims experience in determining the company s estimates of workers compensation and professional liability reserves 
previously the company utilized insurance industry actuarial information  as well as the company s historical claims experience  in developing reserve estimates 
the company maintains insurance coverage on individual claims 
the company is responsible for the cost of individual workers compensation claims and individual professional liability claims up to  per incident which occurred prior to march  and  per incident thereafter 
the company also maintains excess liability coverage relating to professional liability and casualty claims which provides insurance coverage for individual claims of up to  in excess of the underlying coverage limits 
letters of credit and surety bonds have been issued to guarantee payment under the company s workers compensation program 
the company believes that its present insurance coverage and reserves are sufficient to cover currently estimated exposures  but there can be no assurance that the company will not incur liabilities in excess of recorded reserves or in excess of its insurance limits 
settlement issues prior to october   reimbursement of medicare home care nursing services was based on reasonable  allowable costs incurred in providing services to eligible beneficiaries subject to both per visit and per beneficiary limits in accordance with the interim payment system established through the balanced budget act of these costs are reported in annual cost reports  which are filed with the cms  and are subject to audit by the fiscal intermediary engaged by cms 
the fiscal intermediary has not completed its audit of the fiscal cost reports and the review of cost limits relating to certain of the company s medicare providers 
furthermore  settled cost reports relating to certain years prior to fiscal could be subject to reopening of the audit process by the fiscal intermediary 
although management believes that established reserves are sufficient  it is possible that adjustments resulting from such audits by the fiscal intermediary could result in adjustments to the consolidated financial statements that exceed established reserves 
the company has filed appeals with the provider reimbursement review board for the years  and concerning audit adjustments made by its medicare fiscal intermediary 
these audit adjustments relate to the methodology used by the company in allocating a portion of its residual overhead cost on the medicare cost reports 
the company believes its methodology used to allocate such overhead cost was accurate and consistent with past practice accepted by the fiscal intermediary  however  the company has recorded the impact of the audit adjustments in its consolidated financial statements and has not recorded any anticipated recovery from the appeals 
the company is unable to predict the outcome of these appeals 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
sfas requires the use of a non amortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and certain intangibles 
under a non amortization approach  goodwill and certain intangibles are not amortized into results of operations  but instead are reviewed for impairment and an impairment charge is recorded in the periods in which the recorded carrying value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its estimated fair value 
the company adopted sfas as of the beginning of fiscal december  
the provisions of sfas require that a transitional impairment test be performed as of the beginning of the year the statement is adopted 
the provisions of sfas also require that a goodwill impairment test be performed annually or on the occasion of other events that indicate a potential impairment 
the new criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill did not require any reclassification in the company s consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had goodwill of million  of which million related to the home health services business and million related to the sps business 
the sps goodwill of million was acquired by accredo as a component of the net assets of the sps business 
the company s transitional impairment test indicated that there was an impairment of goodwill relating to the home health services business upon adoption of sfas as further described below 
the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment 
the estimate of fair value of the home health services business  as of december   considered publicly available information as well as financial projections and estimates prepared by outside advisors and was determined by subtracting the agreed upon purchase price for the sps business from the market capitalization of the company 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  management compared the estimate of fair value for the home health services business to the book value of the business unit s net assets 
since the book value of home health services net assets was greater than its estimated fair value  management proceeded to the second step to measure the impairment 
the second step compared the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount of the excess 
based on the results of the transitional impairment tests  the company determined that an impairment loss relating to goodwill had occurred and recorded a non cash charge of million  net of tax  as cumulative effect of accounting change in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  this charge included a tax benefit of million relating to tax deductible goodwill  which was recorded in the fiscal year the company recorded a deferred tax benefit of approximately million resulting from this non cash charge and increased its tax valuation allowance by the same amount 
the deferred tax benefit was recorded by eliminating a deferred tax liability of approximately million and recording a deferred tax asset of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal years and  intangibles  principally goodwill  associated with acquired businesses were being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years
