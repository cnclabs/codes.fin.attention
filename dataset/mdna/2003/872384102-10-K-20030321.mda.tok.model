item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity 
products are transported in liquid form from the upper texas gulf coast through two parallel underground pipelines that extend to seymour  indiana 
from seymour  segments of the products pipeline system extend to the chicago  illinois  lima  ohio  selkirk  new york  and philadelphia  pennsylvania  areas 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter  ohio  is dedicated solely to lpgs transportation and storage services 
the products pipeline system includes storage facilities with an aggregate storage capacity of million barrels of refined petroleum products and million barrels of lpgs  including storage capacity leased to outside parties 
the products pipeline system makes deliveries to customers at locations including company owned truck racks  rail car facilities and marine facilities 
deliveries to other pipelines occur at various facilities owned by te products or by third parties 
the products pipeline system is comprised of a inch diameter line extending in a generally northeasterly direction from baytown  texas located approximately miles east of houston  to a point in southwest ohio near lebanon and todhunter 
a second line  which also originates at baytown  is inches in diameter until it reaches beaumont  at which point it reduces to a inch diameter line 
this second line extends along the same path as the inch diameter line to the products pipeline system s terminal in el dorado  arkansas  before continuing as a inch diameter line to seymour 
the products pipeline system also has smaller diameter lines that extend laterally from el dorado to helena  arkansas  from tyler  texas  to el dorado and from mcrae  arkansas  to west memphis  arkansas 
the line from el dorado to helena has a inch diameter 
the line from tyler to el dorado varies in diameter from inches to inches 
the line from mcrae to west memphis has a inch diameter 
the products pipeline system also includes a inch diameter line from seymour to chicago  illinois  and a inch diameter line running from lebanon to lima  ohio 
this inch diameter pipeline connects to the buckeye pipe line company system that serves  among others  markets in michigan and eastern ohio 
the products pipeline system also has a inch diameter pipeline connection to the greater cincinnati northern kentucky international airport and an inch diameter pipeline connection to the george bush intercontinental airport in houston 
in addition  there are numerous smaller diameter lines associated with the gathering and distribution system 
the products pipeline system continues eastward from todhunter  ohio  to greensburg  pennsylvania  at which point it branches into two segments  one ending in selkirk  new york near albany  and the other ending at marcus hook  pennsylvania near philadelphia 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter and ending in selkirk is an inch diameter line  and the line starting at greensburg and ending at marcus hook varies in diameter from inches to inches 
in november  we announced a project to expand our delivery capacity of lpgs 
the expansion will increase delivery capability to the northeast during the peak winter months by approximately one million barrels 
the expansion  which is scheduled for completion during the third quarter of  consists of the construction of three new pump stations located between middletown  ohio  and greenburg  pennsylvania 
in addition to the northeast expansion  we completed our princeton  indiana  lpgs truck rack upgrade in december  and we will add an additional million barrels of brine storage capability at mont belvieu by the summer of te products also owns three inch diameter common carrier petrochemical pipelines between mont belvieu and port arthur  which were completed in the fourth quarter of each of these pipelines is approximately miles in length 
the pipelines transport ethylene  propylene and natural gasoline 
we entered into a year agreement with a major petrochemical producer for guaranteed throughput commitments 
during the years ended december  and  and the two month period ended december   we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of revenue under the throughput and deficiency contract 
we began transporting product through these pipelines in september we believe that our products pipeline system is in compliance with applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations and accepted industry standards and practices 
we perform regular maintenance on all the facilities of the products pipeline system and have an ongoing process of inspecting the products pipeline system and making repairs and replacements when necessary or appropriate 
in addition  we conduct periodic air patrols of the products pipeline system to monitor pipeline integrity and third party right of way encroachments 
major business sector markets our major operations in the downstream segment consist of the transportation  storage and terminaling of refined petroleum products and lpgs along our mainline system  and the storage and short haul transportation of lpgs associated with our mont belvieu lpg operations 
product deliveries  in millions of barrels mmbbls on a regional basis  for the years ended december   and were as follows product deliveries mmbbls years ended december  refined products mainline transportation central midwest ohio and kentucky subtotal lpgs mainline transportation central  midwest and kentucky ohio and northeast subtotal total mainline transportation mont belvieu operations lpgs total product deliveries arkansas  louisiana  missouri and texas 
illinois and indiana 
new york and pennsylvania 
the mix of products delivered varies seasonally 
gasoline demand is generally stronger in the spring and summer months and lpgs demand is generally stronger in the fall and winter months 
weather and economic conditions in the geographic areas served by our products pipeline system also affect the demand for  and the mix of  the products delivered 
refined products and lpgs deliveries for the years ended december   and were as follows product deliveries mmbbls years ended december  refined products mainline transportation gasoline jet fuels middle distillates mtbe subtotal lpgs mainline transportation propane butanes subtotal total mainline transportation mont belvieu operations lpgs total product deliveries primarily diesel fuel  heating oil and other middle distillates 
methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe 
effective april   we ceased transportation of mtbe through our products pipeline system 
refined products mainline transportation our products pipeline system transports refined petroleum products from the upper texas gulf coast  eastern texas and southern arkansas to the central and midwest regions of the united states with deliveries in texas  louisiana  arkansas  missouri  illinois  kentucky  indiana and ohio 
at these points  refined petroleum products are delivered to terminals owned by te products  connecting pipelines and customer owned terminals 
the volume of refined petroleum products transported by our products pipeline system is directly affected by the demand for such products in the geographic regions the system serves 
this market demand varies based upon the different end uses to which the refined products deliveries are applied 
demand for gasoline  which accounted for approximately of the volume of refined products transported through the products pipeline system during  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets that we serve 
demand for refined products used in agricultural operations is affected by weather conditions  government policy and crop prices 
demand for jet fuel depends upon prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
market prices for refined petroleum products affect the demand in the markets served by our downstream segment 
therefore  quantities and mix of products transported may vary 
transportation tariffs of refined petroleum products vary among specific product types 
as a result  market price volatility may affect transportation volumes and revenues from period to period 
lpgs mainline transportation our products pipeline system transports lpgs from the upper texas gulf coast to the central  midwest and northeast regions of the united states 
the products pipeline system east of todhunter  ohio  is devoted solely to the transportation of lpgs 
because propane demand is generally sensitive to weather in the winter months  year to year variations of propane deliveries have occurred and will likely continue to occur 
our ability in the downstream segment to serve propane markets in the northeast is enhanced by our marine import terminal at providence 
this facility includes a  barrel refrigerated storage tank along with ship unloading and truck loading facilities 
effective may  we entered into an agreement with defs to commit sole utilization of the providence terminal to defs 
we operate the terminal and provide propane loading services to defs 
during the years ended december  and  revenues of million and million from defs  respectively  were recognized pursuant to this agreement 
mont belvieu lpgs storage and pipeline shuttle a key aspect of the products pipeline system s lpgs business is its storage and pipeline asset base in the mont belvieu complex serving the fractionation  refining and petrochemical industries 
the complex is the largest of its kind in the united states and provides substantial capacity and flexibility in the transportation  terminaling and storage of ngls  lpgs  petrochemicals and olefins 
our downstream segment has approximately million barrels of lpgs storage capacity  including storage capacity leased to outside parties  at the mont belvieu complex 
the downstream segment includes a mont belvieu short haul transportation shuttle system  consisting of a complex system of pipelines and interconnects  that ties mont belvieu to virtually every refinery and petrochemical facility on the upper texas gulf coast 
in february  we entered into a joint marketing and development alliance with louis dreyfus plastics corporation  now known as louis dreyfus energy services  lp louis dreyfus  in which our mont belvieu lpgs storage and transportation shuttle system services were jointly marketed by louis dreyfus and te products 
the purpose of the alliance was to expand services to the upper texas gulf coast energy marketplace by increasing pipeline throughput and the mix of products handled through the existing system and establishing new receipt and delivery connections 
the alliance was a service oriented  fee based venture with no commodity trading activity 
te products operated the facilities for the alliance 
under the alliance  louis dreyfus invested million for expansion projects at mont belvieu 
the alliance also stipulated that if certain earnings thresholds were achieved  a partnership between te products and louis dreyfus was to be created effective january  all terms and earnings thresholds have been met  therefore  we will be contributing our mont belvieu assets to the newly formed partnership 
the economic terms of the partnership are the same as those under the joint development and marketing alliance 
te products will continue to operate the facilities for the partnership 
the net book value of the mont belvieu assets and liabilities that we are contributing to the partnership is approximately million 
our interest in the partnership will be accounted for as an equity investment 
other operating revenues our downstream segment also earns revenue from terminaling activities and other ancillary services associated with the transportation and storage of refined petroleum products and lpgs 
from time to time  we sell excess product inventory 
other operating revenues include revenues related to the intrastate transportation of petrochemicals under a throughput and deficiency contract 
customers our customers for the transportation of refined petroleum products include major integrated oil companies  independent oil companies  the airline industry and wholesalers 
end markets for these deliveries are primarily retail service stations  truck stops  agricultural enterprises  refineries  and military and commercial jet fuel users 
propane customers include wholesalers and retailers who  in turn  sell to commercial  industrial  agricultural and residential heating customers  as well as utilities who use propane as a back up fuel source 
refineries constitute our major customers for butane and isobutane  which are used as a blend stock for gasolines and as a feed stock for alkylation units  respectively 
at december   our downstream segment had approximately customers 
transportation revenues and percentage of total revenues attributable to the top customers were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the year ended december   no single customer accounted for or more of the downstream segment s revenues 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
we utilize letters of credit and guarantees for certain of our receivables 
however  these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk 
during the year ended december   several customers of the downstream segment filed for bankruptcy protection 
during the year ended december   we expensed approximately million of uncollectible receivables of the downstream segment 
competition the products pipeline system conducts operations without the benefit of exclusive franchises from government entities 
interstate common carrier transportation services are provided through the system pursuant to tariffs filed with the ferc 
because pipelines are generally the lowest cost method for intermediate and long haul overland movement of refined petroleum products and lpgs  the products pipeline system s most significant competitors other than indigenous production in its markets are pipelines in the areas where the products pipeline system delivers products 
competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges  quality of customer service and proximity to end users 
we believe our downstream segment is competitive with other pipelines serving the same markets  however  comparison of different pipelines is difficult due to varying product mix and operations 
trucks  barges and railroads competitively deliver products in some of the areas served by the products pipeline system 
trucking costs  however  render that mode of transportation less competitive for longer hauls or larger volumes 
barge fees for the transportation of refined products are generally lower than te products tariffs 
we face competition from rail movements of lpgs from sarnia  ontario  canada  and waterborne imports into new hampshire 
upstream segment gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil operations we conduct business in our upstream segment through tctm and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries  which gather  transport  market and store crude oil  and distribute lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas and the rocky mountain region 
we commenced our upstream segment business in connection with the acquisition of assets from defs in november our upstream segment utilizes its asset base to aggregate crude oil and provide transportation and specialized services to its regional customers 
our upstream segment purchases crude oil from various producers and operators at the wellhead and makes bulk purchases of crude oil at pipeline and terminal facilities 
the crude oil is then sold to refiners and other customers 
the upstream segment transports crude oil through equity owned pipelines  its trucking operations and third party pipelines 
margins in the upstream segment are calculated as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
margins are a more meaningful measure of financial performance than operating revenues and operating expenses due to the significant fluctuations in revenues and expenses caused by variations in the level of marketing activity and prices for products marketed see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations upstream segment for margin and volume information 
tctm purchases crude oil and simultaneously establishes a margin by selling crude oil for physical delivery to third party users 
we seek to maintain a balanced marketing position until we make physical delivery of the crude oil  thereby minimizing or eliminating our exposure to price fluctuations occurring after the initial purchase 
however  certain basis risks  which are the risks that price relationships between delivery points  classes of products or delivery periods will change  cannot be completely hedged or eliminated 
we make limited use of commodity derivative products for the purpose of hedging price changes 
risk management policies have been established by the risk management committee to monitor and control market risks 
the risk management committee is comprised  in part  of senior executives of the company 
we had no commodity derivative contracts outstanding at december  product deliveries on tctm s owned pipeline systems and undivided joint interest pipelines for the years ended december   and  were as follows in millions years ended december  barrels delivered crude oil transportation crude oil marketing crude oil terminaling lubricants and chemicals total gallons properties the major crude oil pipelines and pipeline systems of our upstream segment are set forth in the following table  which include several pipelines owned jointly with other industry participants or producers crude oil partnership pipeline ownership operator description red river system teppco crude pipeline tcpl  miles of pipeline   barrels storage north texas to south oklahoma south texas system tcpl miles of pipeline   barrels storage south central texas to houston  texas area west texas trunk system tcpl miles of smaller diameter pipeline connecting west texas and southeast new mexico to tctm s midland  texas terminal seaway general partnership interest tcpl mile  inch diameter pipeline   barrels storage texas gulf coast to cushing  oklahoma rancho joint ownership plains all american pipeline  lp mile  inch diameter pipeline west texas to houston  texas basin joint ownership plains all american pipeline  lp mile pipeline permian basin new mexico and texas to cushing  oklahoma tcpl is a wholly owned subsidiary of tctm

our interest in seaway crude pipeline seaway crude pipeline company seaway is a partnership between a subsidiary of tctm  teppco seaway  lp teppco seaway  and conocophillips 
tctm acquired its ownership interest in seaway on july   as part of its purchase of arco pipe line company arco  a wholly owned subsidiary of atlantic richfield company  and transferred the investment to teppco seaway 
we assumed arco s role as operator of this pipeline 
the inch diameter  mile pipeline transports crude oil from the us gulf coast to cushing  a central crude distribution point for the central united states and a delivery point for the new york mercantile exchange nymex 
the freeport  texas  marine terminal is the origin point for the inch diameter crude pipeline 
three large diameter lines carry crude oil from the freeport marine terminal to the adjacent jones creek tank farm  which has six tanks capable of handling approximately million barrels of crude oil 
a crude oil marine terminal facility at texas city  texas  is used to supply refineries in the houston area 
two pipelines connect the texas city marine terminal to tank farms in texas city and galena park  texas  where there are seven tanks with a combined capacity of approximately million barrels 
seaway has the capability to provide marine terminaling and crude oil storage services for all houston area refineries 
the seaway partnership agreement provides for varying participation ratios throughout the life of seaway 
from july   through may  we received of revenue and expense of seaway 
from june until may  we will receive of revenue and expense of seaway 
thereafter  we will receive of revenue and expense of seaway 
for the year ended december   our portion of equity earnings on a pro rated basis averaged approximately 
line transfers  pumpovers and other our upstream segment provides trade documentation services to its customers  primarily at cushing and midland 
tctm documents the transfer of crude oil in its terminal facilities between contracting buyers and sellers 
this line transfer documentation service is related to the trading activity by tctm s customers of nymex open interest crude oil contracts and other physical trading activity 
this service provides a documented record of receipts  deliveries and transactions to each customer  including confirmation of trade matches  inventory management and scheduled movements 
line transfer revenues are included as part of other operating revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
the line transfer services also attract physical barrels to tctm s facilities for final delivery to the ultimate owner 
a pumpover occurs when the last title transfer is executed and the physical barrels are delivered out of tctm s custody 
tctm owns and operates storage facilities primarily in midland and cushing with an operational capacity of approximately million barrels to facilitate the pumpover business 
revenues from pumpover services are included as part of crude oil transportation revenues in our consolidated statements of income and represents the crude oil terminaling component of margin 
the line transfer and pumpover operations were acquired as part of our purchase of arco in july through its subsidiary  lubrication services  lp lsi  tctm distributes lubrication oils and specialty chemicals to natural gas pipelines  gas processors and industrial and commercial accounts 
lsi s distribution networks are located in colorado  wyoming  oklahoma  kansas  new mexico  texas  and louisiana

competition the most significant competitors in pipeline operations in our upstream segment are primarily common carrier and proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies  large independent pipeline companies and other companies in the areas where our pipeline systems deliver crude oil 
competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on posted tariffs  quality of customer service  knowledge of products and markets  and proximity to refineries and connecting pipelines 
the crude oil gathering and marketing business is characterized by thin margins and intense competition for supplies of crude oil at the wellhead 
declines in domestic crude oil production have intensified competition among gatherers and marketers 
a significant portion of the growth in our upstream segment has occurred through acquisitions of pipeline gathering systems 
our acquisitions in this segment have provided increased efficiencies for the gathering and transportation of crude oil with our existing pipeline systems as well as expansion into new market areas 
we experience competition from other gatherers and marketers in bidding for potential acquisitions 
within the past few years  the number of companies involved in the gathering of crude oil in the united states has decreased as a result of business consolidations and bankruptcies  which may decrease the number of potential acquisitions of crude gathering systems available to us 
credit policies and procedures as crude oil or lubrication oils are marketed  we must determine the amount  if any  of credit to be extended to any given customer  particularly in our upstream segment  where transported volumes are typically sold rather than transported for a fee 
due to the nature of individual sales transactions  risk of non payment and non performance by customers is a major consideration in our business 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
we utilize letters of credit and guarantees for certain of our receivables 
however  these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk 
during the years ended december  and  no reserves were necessary for uncollectible receivables of the upstream segment 
during the year ended december   we expensed approximately million of uncollectible receivables of the upstream segment 
midstream segment gathering of natural gas  fractionation of ngls and transportation of ngls we conduct business in our midstream segment through the following teppco colorado  llc teppco colorado  which fractionates ngls  teppco midstream companies  llc  and its wholly owned subsidiaries  chaparral pipeline company  lp and quanah pipeline company  lp collectively referred to as chaparral or chaparral ngl system  dean pipeline company  lp  panola pipeline company  lp and wilcox pipeline company  lp  which transport ngls  and jonah gas gathering company jonah and val verde gas gathering company  lp val verde  which gather natural gas

the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of the acquisition were included in our consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of under a contractual agreement  defs manages and operates the jonah assets on our behalf 
in connection with the acquisition of jonah  we assumed responsibility for the completion of an ongoing expansion of the jonah gas gathering system at a cost of approximately million 
the expansion  which was completed in march  increased the capacity of the jonah system by  from approximately million cubic feet per day mmcf day  to approximately mmcf day 
in october  additional expansion projects were completed  which increased the capacity of the jonah system from mmcf day to approximately mmcf day 
these projects were completed at a combined cost of approximately million 
in february  a producer on the jonah system sent a letter to alberta energy company implying that as a result of our acquisition of the jonah system  it may have a right to acquire all or a portion of the assets comprising the jonah system pursuant to an alleged right of first refusal in a gas gathering agreement between the producer and jonah 
subsidiaries of alberta energy company have agreed to indemnify us against losses resulting from any breach of representations concerning the absence of third party rights in connection with our acquisition of the entity that owns the jonah system 
we believe that we have adequate legal defenses if the producer should assert a claim  and we also believe that no right of first refusal on any of the underlying jonah system assets has been triggered 
on march   we completed the purchase of the chaparral ngl system for million from diamond koch ii  lp and diamond koch iii  lp  including acquisition related costs of approximately million

the basin is one of the most prolific sources of cbm and also contains significant conventional gas reserves 
the system is one of the largest cbm gathering and treating facilities in the united states  gathering cbm from more than separate wells throughout northern new mexico and southern colorado  and provides gathering and treating services pursuant to long term contracts with approximately different natural gas producers in the san juan basin 
gas transported on the val verde system is delivered to several interstate pipeline systems serving the western united states  as well as local new mexico markets 
ngl transportation the ngl pipelines of the midstream segment are located along the texas gulf coast and along southeastern new mexico and west texas to mont belvieu 
they are all wholly owned and operated by either our subsidiaries or defs 
information concerning these ngl pipelines is set forth in the following table capacity ngl pipeline barrels day description dean  dean north miles of pipeline mont belvieu  texas to point comfort  texas dean south miles of pipeline south texas to point comfort  texas panola  miles of pipeline carthage  texas to mont belvieu  texas san jacinto  miles of pipeline carthage  texas to longview  texas wilcox  miles of pipeline southeast texas chaparral  miles of pipeline west texas and new mexico to mont belvieu  texas quanah  miles of pipeline sutton county  texas to the chaparral pipeline near midland  texas beginning in january  the northern portion of the dean pipeline was converted to transport refinery grade propylene from mont belvieu to point comfort  texas 
effective in  dean north will be classified as a part of the downstream segment at the time of the change in the product being transported 
none of these pipelines are mortgaged or encumbered to secure funded debt 
the wilcox ngl pipeline transports ngls for defs from two of their natural gas processing plants 
the wilcox ngl pipeline is currently supported by a throughput agreement with defs through the fees paid to us by defs under the agreement totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the panola pipeline and san jacinto pipeline were purchased on december   from defs for million and originate at defs east texas plant complex in panola county  texas 
for the years ended december  and  revenues recognized included million and million  respectively  from a subsidiary of defs for ngl transportation fees on the panola and san jacinto pipelines 
customers the midstream segment s customers for the gathering of natural gas include major integrated oil and gas companies and large to medium sized independent producers 
natural gas from jonah and val verde is delivered into major interstate gas pipelines for delivery primarily to markets along the west coast 
ngl sales are primarily to major integrated oil and gas companies and independent refiners 
at december   the midstream segment had approximately customers 
revenues attributable to the top customers were million for the year ended december   of which defs  encana corporation formerly alberta energy company  and burlington resources inc accounted for approximately  and of revenues of the midstream segment  respectively 
at december   the midstream segment had customers 
revenues attributable to the top customers were million for the year ended december   of which defs  enron corp 
and alberta energy company accounted for approximately  and of revenues of the midstream segment  respectively 
at december   the midstream segment had three customers 
revenues attributable to the three customers were million  of which defs and enron corp 
accounted for and of revenues of the midstream segment  respectively 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through credit analysis  credit approvals  credit limits and monitoring procedures 
we utilize letters of credit and guarantees for certain of our receivables 
however  these procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk 
in december  we expensed approximately million of uncollected transportation deficiency revenues due to the bankruptcy of enron corp 
and certain of its subsidiaries in december competition the most significant competition for the ngl pipeline operations of our midstream segment comes primarily from proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil and gas companies or other large independent pipeline companies with contiguous operations 
the ability to compete in the ngl pipeline area is based primarily on the quality of customer service  knowledge of products and markets and market responsive transportation rates 
the majority of the recent growth in the midstream segment is due to the acquisition of jonah in wyoming and val verde in new mexico and colorado 
typically new supplies of natural gas are necessary to offset the natural declines in production from wells connected to any gathering system 
the jonah and pinedale fields that are the focus of our jonah system in wyoming are both relatively young producing areas  characterized by long lived production profiles and many years of significant growth potential ahead 
we expect to aggressively market this system by obtaining contracts to gather additional natural gas supplies 
competition in the natural gas gathering operations of our midstream segment is based in large part on reputation  efficiency  system reliability  system capacity and market responsive pricing arrangements 
key competitors in the gathering and treating segment include independent gas gatherers as well as other major integrated energy companies 
alternate gathering facilities may be available to producers served by our midstream segment  and those producers could also elect to construct proprietary gas gathering systems 
success in the gas gathering and treating business segment is based primarily on a thorough understanding of the needs of the producers served  as well as a strong commitment to providing responsive  high quality customer service 
if the production ultimately delivered to one of our gathering systems declines  revenues from such operations would also be adversely affected 
if such declines are sustained or substantial  then we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
title to properties we believe we have satisfactory title to all of our assets 
the properties are subject to liabilities in certain cases  such as customary interests generally contracted in connection with acquisition of the properties  liens for taxes not yet due  easements  restrictions  and other minor encumbrances 
in february  a producer on the jonah system sent a letter to alberta energy company implying that as a result of our acquisition of the jonah system  it may have a right to acquire all or a portion of the assets comprising the jonah system 
see items and business and properties  midstream segment gathering of natural gas  fractionation of ngls and transportation of ngls for a more detailed discussion of the matter 
we believe none of these liabilities materially affect the value of our properties or our interest in the properties or will materially interfere with their use in the operation of our business 
capital expenditures capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  totaled million for the year ended december  revenue generating projects include those projects which expand service into new markets or expand capacity into current markets 
capital expenditures to sustain existing operations include projects required by regulatory agencies or required life cycle replacements

an additional million was used to construct connections and related facilities for our petrochemical pipeline system extending from mont belvieu to port arthur 
we also spent approximately million to expand capacity at truck loading facilities at princeton  indiana  and lebanon  ohio 
revenue generating capital spending by the midstream segment related primarily to a million expansion of the jonah system to increase its capacity 
the remaining revenue generating capital spending of the midstream segment was used to construct well connections 
we estimate that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million which includes million of capitalized interest 
we expect to use approximately million for revenue generating projects 
capital spending on revenue generating projects will include approximately million for the expansion of our pumping capacity of lpgs into the northeast markets  approximately million for expansion of our downstream segment s deliverability capacity  million to expand upstream segment facilities and approximately million for the expansion of midstream assets 
we expect to spend approximately million to sustain existing operations  of which approximately million will be for downstream segment pipeline projects  including the replacement of storage tanks  pipeline rehabilitation projects to comply with regulations enacted by the united states department of transportation office of pipeline safety ops and the installation of replacement electrical distribution facilities at our mont belvieu facilities  million for upgrades of our upstream segment and million of capital expenditures to sustain existing operations on the midstream segment 
an additional million will be expended on system upgrade projects among all of our business segments 
we continually review and evaluate potential capital improvements and expansions that would be complementary to our present business segments 
these expenditures can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of our transactions 
we may finance capital expenditures through internally generated funds  debt or the issuance of additional equity 
regulation our interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the provisions of the interstate commerce act ica  the energy policy act of act and rules and orders promulgated pursuant thereto 
ferc regulation requires that interstate refined petroleum products and crude oil pipeline rates be posted publicly and that these rates be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
rates of interstate refined petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies  like us  are currently regulated by the ferc primarily through an index methodology  which allows a pipeline to change its rates based on the change from year to year in the producer price index for finished goods ppi index 
effective as of february   ferc order on remand modified the ppi index from ppi to ppi 
in the alternative  interstate refined petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies may elect to support rate filings by using a cost of service methodology  competitive market showings market based rates or agreements between shippers and refined petroleum products and crude oil pipeline companies that the rate is acceptable settlement rates 
on may   te products filed an application with the ferc requesting permission to charge market based rates for substantially all refined products transportation tariffs 
on july   the ferc issued an order granting te products market based rates in certain markets and set for hearing te products application for market based rates in certain destination markets and origin markets 
after the matter was set for hearing  te products and the protesting shippers entered into a settlement agreement resolving their respective differences 
on april   the ferc issued an order approving the offer of settlement 
as a result of the settlement  te products recognized approximately million of previously deferred transportation revenue in the second quarter of as a part of the settlement  te products withdrew the application for market based rates to the little rock  arkansas  and arcadia and shreveport arcadia  louisiana  destination markets  which are currently subject to the ppi index 
as a result  we made refunds of approximately million in the third quarter of for those destination markets 
in a decision involving an unrelated pipeline limited partnership  the ferc partially disallowed the inclusion of income taxes in that partnership s cost of service 
in another ferc proceeding involving a different pipeline limited partnership  the ferc held that the pipeline limited partnership may not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non corporate limited partners  both individuals and other entities 
these ferc decisions do not affect our current rates and rate structure because we do not use the cost of service methodology to support our rates 
however  the ferc decisions might become relevant to us should we i elect in the future to use the cost of service methodology or ii be required to use such methodology to defend initial rates or our indexed rates against a shipper protest alleging that an indexed rate increase substantially exceeds actual cost increases 
should these circumstances arise  there can be no assurance with respect to the effect of these precedents on our rates in view of the uncertainties involved in this issue 
the natural gas gathering operations of the jonah and val verde systems are exempt from ferc regulation under the natural gas act of since they are intrastate gas gathering systems rather than interstate transmission pipelines 
however  ferc regulation still significantly affects the midstream segment  directly or indirectly  by its influences on the parties that produce the natural gas gathered on the jonah and val verde systems 
in addition  in recent years  ferc has pursued pro competition policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines 
if the ferc does not continue the pro competition policies as it considers pipeline rate case proposals  revisions to rules and policies that affect shipper rights of access to interstate natural gas transportation capacity or proposals by natural gas pipelines to allow natural gas pipelines to charge negotiated rates without rate ceiling limits  such policy changes could have an adverse effect on the gathering rates the midstream segment is able to charge in the future 
environmental matters our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of injunctions delaying or prohibiting certain activities and the need to perform investigatory and remedial activities 
although we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  risks of significant costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and we cannot assure you that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 
we believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the near term 
water the federal water pollution control act of  as renamed and amended as the clean water act cwa  and analogous state laws impose strict controls against the discharge of oil and its derivatives into navigable waters 
the cwa provides penalties for any discharges of petroleum products in reportable quantities and imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removing petroleum or other hazardous substances 
state laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of a release of petroleum or its derivatives in navigable waters or into groundwater 
spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent a petroleum tank release from impacting navigable waters 
contamination resulting from spills or releases of petroleum products is an inherent risk within the petroleum pipeline industry 
to the extent that groundwater contamination requiring remediation exists along our pipeline systems as a result of past operations  we believe any such contamination could be controlled or remedied without having a material adverse effect on our financial position  but such costs are site specific  and we cannot assure you that the effect will not be material in the aggregate 
the primary federal law for oil spill liability is the oil pollution act of opa  which addresses three principal areas of oil pollution prevention  containment and cleanup  and liability 
opa applies to vessels  offshore platforms and onshore facilities  including terminals  pipelines and transfer facilities 
in order to handle  store or transport oil  shore facilities are required to file oil spill response plans with the appropriate federal agency being either the united states coast guard  the ops or the environmental protection agency epa 
numerous states have enacted laws similar to opa 
under opa and similar state laws  responsible parties for a regulated facility from which oil is discharged may be liable for removal costs and natural resource damages 
the epa has adopted regulations that require us to have permits in order to discharge certain storm water run off 
storm water discharge permits may also be required by certain states in which we operate 
these permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water run off 
air emissions our operations are subject to the federal clean air act the clean air act and comparable state laws 
amendments to the clean air act  as well as recent or soon to be adopted changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional  non attainment areas  may require our operations to incur future capital expenditures in connection with the addition or modification of existing air emission control equipment and strategies 
in addition  some of our facilities are included within the categories of hazardous air pollutant sources  which are subject to increasing regulation under the clean air act 
the clean air act requires federal operating permits for major sources of air emissions 
under this program  a federal operating permit a title v permit may be issued 
the permit acts as an umbrella that includes other federal  state and local preconstruction and or operating permit provisions  emission standards  grandfathered rates and record keeping  reporting and monitoring requirements in a single document 
the federal operating permit is the tool that the public and regulatory agencies use to review and enforce a site s compliance with all aspects of clean air regulation at the federal  state and local level 
we have completed applications for the facilities for which these regulations apply 
risk management plans we are subject to the epa s risk management plan rmp regulations at certain locations 
this regulation is intended to work with the occupational safety and health act osha process safety management regulation see safety regulation below to minimize the offsite consequences of catastrophic releases 
the regulation requires a regulated source  in excess of threshold quantities  to develop and implement a risk management program that includes a five year accident history  an offsite consequence analyses  a prevention program and an emergency response program 
we believe the operating expenses of the rmp regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
solid waste we generate hazardous and non hazardous solid wastes that are subject to requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state statutes 
amendments to rcra required the epa to promulgate regulations banning the land disposal of all hazardous wastes unless the wastes meet certain treatment standards or the land disposal method meets certain waste containment criteria 
from time to time  the epa considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non hazardous wastes  including crude oil and gas wastes 
the adoption of such stricter standards for non hazardous wastes  or any future re designation of non hazardous wastes as hazardous wastes will likely increase our operating expenses as well as the industry in general 
we utilize waste minimization and recycling processes to reduce the volume of our waste 
we currently have one permitted on site waste water treatment facility 
operating expenses of this facility have not had a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
superfund the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla  also known as superfund  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original act  on certain classes of persons who contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of a facility where a release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at a facility 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
in the course of our ordinary operations  our pipeline system generates wastes that may fall within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance 
in the event a disposal facility previously used by us requires clean up in the future  we may be responsible under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
in december  we were notified by the epa of potential liability for alleged waste disposal at container recycling  inc  located in kansas city  kansas 
we were also asked to respond to an epa information request 
our response to the information request has been filed with the epa region vii office 
based on information we have received from the epa  as well as through our internal investigations  we are pursuing dismissal from this matter 
in november  we were notified by the epa of a potential liability for alleged waste disposal at industrial pollution control located in jackson  mississippi 
based on the pro rata share of waste disposed of at the facility  the potentially responsible parties were requested to file a tolling agreement 
we filed this agreement with the epa in december our contribution of total waste disposed of at the facility was estimated to be less than and potential liabilities are not expected to exceed other environmental proceedings in  we entered into an agreed order with the indiana department of environmental management idem that resulted in the implementation of a remediation program for groundwater contamination attributable to our operations at the seymour terminal 
in  the idem approved a feasibility study  which includes our proposed remediation program 
in march  the idem issued a record of decision formally approving the remediation program 
as the record of decision has been issued  we will enter into an agreed order for the continued operation and maintenance of the remediation program 
we have an accrued liability of million at december   for future remediation costs at the seymour terminal 
we do not expect that the completion of the remediation program will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq issued a compliance order for environmental contamination at our arcadia  louisiana  facility 
this contamination may be attributable to our operations  as well as adjacent petroleum terminals operated by other companies 
in  our arcadia facility and adjacent terminals were directed by the remediation services division of the ldeq to pursue remediation of this containment phase 
at december   we have an accrued liability of million for remediation costs at our arcadia facility 
we do not expect that the completion of the remediation program that we have proposed will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   we had an accrued liability of million and a receivable of million from defs related to various tctm sites requiring environmental remediation activities 
the receivable is based on a contractual indemnity obligation we received in connection with our acquisition of assets from a defs affiliate in november the indemnity relates to future environmental remediation activities attributable to operations of these assets prior to our acquisition 
under this indemnity obligation  we are responsible for the first million in specified environmental liabilities  and defs is responsible for those environmental liabilities in excess of million  up to a maximum amount of million 
the majority of the receivable from defs relates to remediation activities at the velma crude oil site in stephens county  oklahoma 
the accrued liability balance at december   also includes an accrual of million related to the shelby crude oil site in stephens county  oklahoma 
at december   it is uncertain if these costs related to shelby are covered under the indemnity obligation from defs 
we are currently in discussions with defs regarding these matters 
we do not expect that the completion of remediation programs associated with tctm activities will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
dot pipeline compliance matters we are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation dot under the accountable pipeline and safety partnership act of  sometimes referred to as the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act hlpsa  and comparable state statutes relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of our pipeline facilities 
the hlpsa covers petroleum and petroleum products and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations  to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
the hlpsa was reauthorized in we are subject to the ops regulation requiring qualification of pipeline personnel 
the regulation requires pipeline operators to develop and maintain a written qualification program for individuals performing covered tasks on pipeline facilities 
the intent of this regulation is to ensure a qualified work force and to reduce the probability and consequence of incidents caused by human error 
the regulation establishes qualification requirements for individuals performing covered tasks  and amends certain training requirements in existing regulations 
a written qualification program was completed in april  and our employees performing a covered task were qualified by the october deadline 
we are also subject to the ops integrity management regulations which specify how companies with greater than miles of pipeline should assess  evaluate  validate and maintain the integrity of pipeline segments that  in the event of a release  could impact high consequence areas hca 
hca are defined as highly populated areas  unusually sensitive environmental areas and commercially navigable waterways 
the regulation requires an integrity management program imp be developed that utilizes internal pipeline inspection  pressure testing  or other equally effective means to assess the integrity of hca pipeline segments 
the regulation also requires periodic review of hca pipeline segments to ensure adequate preventative and mitigative measures exist and that companies take prompt action to address integrity issues raised by the assessment and analysis 
in compliance with these ops regulations  we identified our hca pipeline segments and developed an imp by the march  deadline 
the regulations require that initial hca baseline integrity assessments are conducted within seven years  with all subsequent assessments conducted on a five year cycle 
we will evaluate each pipeline segment s integrity by analyzing available information and develop a range of potential impacts resulting from a potential release to a hca 
we are currently developing cost estimates related to our baseline integrity assessments 
safety matters we are also subject to the requirements of the federal osha and comparable state statutes 
we believe we are in material compliance with osha and state requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposures 
the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act and comparable state statutes require us to organize and disclose information about the hazardous materials used in our operations 
certain parts of this information must be reported to employees  state and local governmental authorities  and local citizens upon request 
we are subject to osha process safety management psm regulations  which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic  reactive  flammable or explosive chemicals 
these regulations apply to any process which involves a chemical at or above the specified thresholds or any process which involves a flammable liquid or gas  as defined in the regulations  stored on site in one location  in a quantity of  pounds or more 
we utilize certain covered processes and maintain storage of lpgs in pressurized tanks  caverns and wells  in excess of  pounds at various locations 
flammable liquids stored in atmospheric tanks below their normal boiling point without benefit of chilling or refrigeration are exempt 
we believe we are in material compliance with the osha regulations 
in general  we expect to increase our expenditures during the next decade to comply with stricter industry and regulatory safety standards such as those described above 
while such expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time  we do not believe that they will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
employees we do not have any employees  officers or directors 
the general partner is responsible for the management of us and our subsidiaries 
as of december   the general partner had employees

we operate and report in three business segments downstream segment transportation and storage of refined products  lpgs and petrochemicals  upstream segment gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil  and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  and midstream segment gathering of natural gas  fractionation of ngls and transportation of ngls 
our reportable segments offer different products and services and are managed separately because each requires different business strategies 
teppco gp  our wholly owned subsidiary  acts as managing general partner of our operating partnerships with a general partner interest and manages our subsidiaries 
effective january   we realigned our three business segments to reflect our entry into the natural gas gathering business and the expanded scope of ngls operations 
we transferred the fractionation of ngls  which was previously reflected as part of the downstream segment  to the midstream segment 
the operation of ngl pipelines  which was previously reflected as part of the upstream segment  was also transferred to the midstream segment 
we have adjusted our period to period comparisons to conform with the current presentation 
our downstream segment revenues are earned from transportation and storage of refined products and lpgs  storage and short haul shuttle transportation of lpgs at the mont belvieu complex  intrastate transportation of petrochemicals  sale of product inventory and other ancillary services 
the two largest operating expense items of the downstream segment are labor and electric power 
we generally realize higher revenues during the first and fourth quarters of each year since our operations are somewhat seasonal 
refined products volumes are generally higher during the second and third quarters because of greater demand for gasolines during the spring and summer driving seasons 
lpgs volumes are generally higher from november through march due to higher demand in the northeast for propane  a major fuel for residential heating 
our downstream segment also includes our equity investment in centennial 
our upstream segment revenues are earned from gathering  transportation  marketing and storage of crude oil  and distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals  principally in oklahoma  texas and the rocky mountain region 
marketing operations consist primarily of aggregating purchased crude oil along our pipeline systems  or from third party pipeline systems  and arranging the necessary logistics for the ultimate sale of the crude oil to local refineries  marketers or other end users 
our upstream segment also includes the equity earnings from our investment in seaway 
seaway is a large diameter pipeline that transports crude oil from the us gulf coast to cushing  a central crude oil distribution point for the central united states 
our midstream segment revenues are earned from the gathering of natural gas  fractionation of ngls and transportation of ngls 
the midstream segment includes the operations from the acquisition of jonah on september   from alberta energy company for million 
we paid an additional million on february   for final purchase adjustments related primarily to construction projects in progress at the time of closing 
the results of operations of the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements beginning in the fourth quarter of the jonah assets are managed and operated by defs under a contractual agreement 
on march   we completed the purchase of the chaparral ngl system for million from diamond koch ii  lp and diamond koch iii  lp  including acquisition related costs of approximately million 
the chaparral ngl system has an mile pipeline that extends from west texas and new mexico to mont belvieu 
the pipeline delivers ngls to fractionators and to our existing storage in mont belvieu 
the chaparral ngl system also has an approximately mile ngl gathering system located in west texas  which begins in sutton county  texas  and connects to the mile pipeline near midland 
the pipelines are connected to gas plants in west texas and have approximately  horsepower of pumping capacity at stations 
the chaparral ngl system is managed and operated by defs under a contractual agreement 
these assets are included in the midstream segment 
on june   we completed the purchase of the val verde gathering system for million from burlington resources gathering inc  a subsidiary of burlington resources inc  including acquisition related costs of approximately million 
val verde gathers cbm from the fruitland coal formation of the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
the system is one of the largest cbm gathering and treating facilities in the united states  gathering cbm from more than separate wells throughout new mexico 
the system provides gathering and treating services pursuant to approximately long term contracts with approximately different gas producers in the san juan basin 
gas gathered on the val verde gathering system is delivered to several interstate pipeline systems serving the western united states and to local new mexico markets 
the val verde gathering system consists of miles of pipeline ranging in size from inches to inches in diameter  compressor stations operating over  horsepower of compression and a large amine treating facility for the removal of carbon dioxide 
the system has a pipeline capacity of approximately one billion cubic feet per day 
the val verde assets are managed and operated by defs under a contractual agreement 
these assets are included in the midstream segment 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in these estimates could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
key estimates used by management include revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  depreciation and amortization  asset impairment and fair values of assets acquired 
significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal to our financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue and expense accruals  environmental costs  property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue and expense accruals we routinely make accruals for both revenues and expenses before we receive certain third party information and reconcile our records with those of third parties 
the delayed information from third parties includes  among other things  actual volumes of crude oil purchased  transported or sold  adjustments to inventory and invoices for purchases and other operating expenses 
we make accruals to reflect estimates for these items based on our internal records and information from third parties 
the estimated accruals are reversed in the following month when actual information is received from third parties and our internal records have been reconciled 
environmental costs at december   we have accrued a liability for our estimate of the future payments we expect to pay for environmental costs to remediate existing conditions attributable to past operations 
we accrue for environmental costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations 
environmental costs include initial site surveys and environmental studies of potentially contaminated sites  costs for remediation and restoration of sites determined to be contaminated and ongoing monitoring costs  as well as fines  damages and other costs  when estimable 
we monitor the balance of accrued undiscounted environmental liabilities on a regular basis 
we record liabilities for environmental costs at a specific site when our liability for such costs  including direct internal and legal costs  is probable and a reasonable estimate of the associated costs can be made 
adjustments to initial estimates are recorded  from time to time  to reflect changing circumstances and estimates based upon additional information developed in subsequent periods 
estimates of our ultimate liabilities associated with environmental costs are particularly difficult to make with certainty due to the number of variables involved  including the early stage of investigation at certain sites  the lengthy time frames required to complete remediation alternatives available and the evolving nature of environmental laws and regulations 
for information concerning environmental regulation and environmental costs and contingencies  see item and business and properties environmental matters in this report 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment at its acquisition cost 
additions to property  plant and equipment  including major replacements or betterments  are recorded at cost 
we charge replacements and renewals of minor items of property that do not materially increase values or extend useful lives to maintenance expense 
depreciation expense is computed on the straight line method using rates based upon expected useful lives of various classes of assets ranging from to per annum 
we evaluate impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of  and effective january   sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the carrying amount of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
estimates of future net cash flows include anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and other estimates 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
during the second quarter of  pennzoil quaker state company pennzoil sold its shreveport  louisiana  refinery 
under its transportation agreement with te products  pennzoil had a throughput commitment of  barrels per day 
pennzoil and te products negotiated a settlement of million to terminate the long term transportation agreement from the shreveport origin point on the products pipeline system 
the termination payment was recorded as refined products transportation revenue in we have evaluated the impact of the contract termination on the pipeline segment from shreveport to el dorado  arkansas  in accordance with sfas the evaluation did not result in an impairment of the carrying value of the related transportation assets  which was million at december  we are pursuing various alternatives including making system changes to allow for bi directional product flow to make deliveries into the shreveport market area 
we have completed feasibility studies  and we are in discussions with potential customers regarding the transportation of volumes through this pipeline 
if alternative revenue sources are not realized on this pipeline segment  an impairment may be recorded for the excess of the carrying value over discounted future net cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets represent the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
certain assumptions and estimates are employed in determining the fair value of assets acquired including goodwill and other intangible assets as well as determining the allocation of goodwill to the appropriate reporting unit 
in addition  we assess the recoverability of these intangibles by determining whether the amortization of these intangibles over their remaining useful lives can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the acquired operations 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts exceed the projected discounted future operating cash flows 
during  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which discontinues the amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles and requires an annual test of impairment based on a comparison of fair value to carrying values 
the evaluation of impairment under sfas requires the use of projections  estimates and assumptions as to the future performance of the operations  including anticipated future revenues  expected future operating costs and the discount factor used 
actual results could differ from projections resulting in revisions to our assumptions and  if required  recognizing an impairment loss 
based on our assessment  we do not believe our goodwill is impaired and we have not recorded a charge from the adoption of sfas at december   we have million of natural gas transportation contracts which were recorded as part of our acquisitions of jonah on september   and val verde on june  see note acquisitions 
the value assigned to the natural gas transportation contracts required management to make estimates regarding the fair value of the assets acquired 
in connection with the acquisition of jonah  we assumed contracts that dedicate future production from natural gas wells in the green river basin in wyoming 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these production contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of closing 
in connection with the acquisition of val verde  we assumed fixed term gas transportation contracts with customers in the san juan basin in new mexico and colorado 
we assigned million of the purchase price to these fixed term contracts based upon a fair value appraisal at the time of the closing 
the value assigned to intangible assets is amortized on a unit of production basis  based upon the actual throughput of the system over the expected total throughput for the lives of the contracts 
the amortization of the jonah and val verde systems are expected to average approximately years and years  respectively 
on a quarterly basis  we update production estimates of the natural gas wells and evaluate the remaining expected useful life of the contract assets 
changes in the estimated remaining production will impact the timing of amortization expense reported for future periods

year ended december  compared to year ended december  our downstream segment reported earnings before interest of million for the year ended december   compared with earnings before interest of million for the year ended december  earnings before interest decreased million primarily due to a decrease of million in operating revenues  an increase of million in costs and expenses  additional losses of million from equity investments and a decrease of million in other income net 
we discuss the factors influencing these variances below 
revenues from refined products transportation decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to million of revenue recognized in from a cash settlement received from a canceled transportation agreement with pennzoil and the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue related to the approval of market based rates during the second quarter of see further discussion regarding these factors included in other considerations 
these decreases were partially offset by a increase in refined products volumes delivered during the year ended december   primarily due to barrels received into our pipeline from centennial at creal springs  illinois 
centennial commenced refined products deliveries to us beginning in april the overall increase in refined products deliveries was partially offset by a million barrel decrease in mtbe deliveries as a result of the expiration of contract deliveries to our marine terminal near beaumont effective april as a result of the contract expiration  we no longer transport mtbe through our products pipeline system 
the refined products average rate per barrel decreased from the prior year due to the impact of the midwest origin point for volumes received from centennial  which was partially offset by decreased short haul mtbe volumes delivered  and higher market based tariff rates  which went into effect in july revenues from lpgs transportation decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to decreased deliveries of propane in the upper midwest and northeast market areas attributable to warmer than normal weather in the first quarter of the decrease was also due to lower prices from competing canadian and mid continent propane supply as compared to propane originating from the gulf coast 
total lpgs volumes delivered increased as a result of increased short haul deliveries to a petrochemical facility on the upper texas gulf coast 
the lpgs average rate per barrel decreased from the prior year as a result of a decreased percentage of long haul deliveries during the year ended december  revenues generated from mont belvieu operations increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as a result of increased storage revenue and receipt revenue 
mont belvieu shuttle volumes delivered increased during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to increased petrochemical demand 
the mont belvieu average rate per barrel decreased during the year ended december   as a result of increased contract shuttle deliveries  which generally carry lower rates 
other operating revenues decreased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to lower propane deliveries from our providence import facility  lower refined products storage revenue  lower margins on product inventory sales and lower revenues from product location exchanges which are used to position product in the midwest market area 
these decreases were partially offset by increased refined products and lpgs loading fees 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase was comprised of an increase of million in operating  general and administrative expenses  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense and an increase of million in taxes other than income taxes 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in operating fuel and power expense 
operating  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher pipeline maintenance expenses  increased consulting and contract services  increased labor costs and increased general and administrative supplies expense 
depreciation expense increased from the prior year because of assets placed in service during taxes other than income taxes increased as a result of a higher property base in operating fuel and power expense decreased as a result of decreased long haul volumes delivered related to midwest volumes received from centennial and lower power costs 
net losses from equity investments totaled million during the year ended december   due to pre operating expenses and start up costs of centennial  which commenced operations in early april other income net decreased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
the downstream segment is dependent in large part on the demand for refined petroleum products in the markets served by its pipelines 
reductions in that demand adversely affect the pipeline business of the downstream segment 
market demand varies based upon the different end uses of the refined products shipped in the downstream segment 
demand for gasoline  which in recent years has accounted for approximately one half of the downstream segment s refined products transportation revenues  depends upon price  prevailing economic conditions and demographic changes in the markets served in the downstream segment 
weather conditions and governmental policy affect the demand for refined products used in agricultural operations 
demand for jet fuel  which in recent years has accounted for approximately one quarter of the downstream segment s refined products revenues  depends on prevailing economic conditions and military usage 
propane deliveries are generally sensitive to the weather and meaningful year to year variances have occurred and will likely continue to occur 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our downstream segment reported earnings before interest of million for the year ended december   compared with earnings before interest of million for the year ended december  earnings before interest increased million primarily due to an increase of million in operating revenues  partially offset by an increase of million in costs and expenses  additional losses of million from equity investments and a decrease of million in other income net 
we discuss the factors influencing these variances below 
revenues from refined products transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to million of revenue recognized on the canceled transportation agreement with pennzoil in and the recognition of million of previously deferred revenue related to the approval of market based rates during the second quarter of these increases were partially offset by a decrease in refined products volumes delivered 
deliveries of mtbe decreased million barrels as a result of the expiration of contract deliveries to our marine terminal near beaumont in april jet fuel volumes decreased million barrels  or  due to reduced air travel demand in the midwest market areas 
the total refined products volume decrease was partially offset by increased distillate demand in the south central market areas and increased distillate deliveries at a third party terminal in houston  texas 
the refined products average rate per barrel increased from the prior year period primarily due to an increased percentage of long haul volumes delivered in revenues from lpgs transportation increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to increased propane deliveries in the midwest that resulted from favorable price differentials of gulf coast propane compared with competing midwest supply sources 
additionally  increased feedstock demand resulted in higher deliveries of isobutane in the chicago market area 
short haul deliveries of propane along the upper texas gulf coast decreased from the prior year due to lower petrochemical feedstock demand and operational problems at a petrochemical facility that we serve 
the lpgs average rate per barrel increased from the prior year as a result of an increased percentage of long haul deliveries to the upper midwest market areas 
revenues generated from mont belvieu operations increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   as a result of increased loading fees  brine service revenue and butane segregation charges  partially offset by lower contract storage revenue 
mont belvieu shuttle deliveries decreased during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to reduced propane and butane demand for petrochemical feedstock along the upper texas gulf coast 
the mont belvieu average rate per barrel increased in as a result of increased non contract deliveries  which generally carry higher rates 
other operating revenues increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to an increase of million in contract petrochemical delivery revenue  which began during the fourth quarter of  increased refined products loading fees  increased propane deliveries from the providence import facility and increased gains on product sales 
these increases were partially offset by lower revenues from product location exchanges which are used to position product in the midwest market area 
costs and expenses increased million for the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   and were comprised of an increase of million in operating  general and administrative expenses  an increase of million in operating fuel and power expense and an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by a decrease of million in taxes other than income taxes 
the increase in operating  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased employee benefit costs  increased supplies and services and environmental remediation expenses  partially offset by the march write off of project evaluation costs related to the proposed pipeline construction from beaumont to little rock  arkansas  and decreased product measurement losses 
operating fuel and power expense increased as a result of higher rates charged by electric utilities and increased long haul volumes delivered 
the increase in depreciation expense from the prior year period resulted from assets placed in service during the fourth quarter of the decrease in taxes other than income taxes resulted from actual property taxes being lower than previously estimated 
net losses from equity investments totaled million during the year ended december   due primarily to pre operating expenses of centennial 
other income net decreased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   primarily due to lower interest income earned on cash investments 
upstream segment we calculate the margin of the upstream segment as revenues generated from the sale of crude oil and lubrication oil  and transportation of crude oil  less the costs of purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil 
margin is a more meaningful measure of financial performance than operating revenues and operating expenses due to the significant fluctuations in revenues and expenses caused by variations in the level of marketing activity and prices for products marketed 
margin and volume information for the years ended december   and is presented below in thousands  except per barrel and per gallon amounts percentage years ended december  increase decrease margins crude oil transportation crude oil marketing crude oil terminaling lubrication oil sales total margin total barrels crude oil transportation crude oil marketing crude oil terminaling lubrication oil volume total gallons margin per barrel crude oil transportation crude oil marketing crude oil terminaling lubrication oil margin per gallon year ended december  compared to year ended december  our upstream segment reported earnings before interest of million for the year ended december   compared with earnings before interest of million for the year ended december  earnings before interest increased million primarily due to an increase of million in margin  a decrease of million in costs and expenses excluding purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil  an increase of million in other income net and an increase of million in equity earnings of seaway 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in other operating revenues 
we discuss the factors influencing these variances below 
our margin increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  crude oil transportation margin increased million primarily due to volumes transported on the pipeline assets acquired from valero in march and higher revenues on our basin  red river and west texas systems 
crude oil terminaling margin remained constant between years as a result of higher volumes at midland and our red river system  offset by lower volumes at cushing and on our basin system 
lubrication oil sales margin increased million due to increased volumes related to the acquisition of a lubrication oil distributor in amarillo  texas  in the fourth quarter of crude oil marketing margin increased million primarily due to increased volumes marketed  renegotiated supply contracts and lower trucking expenses 
other operating revenues of the upstream segment decreased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to lower revenues from documentation and other services to support customers trading activity at midland and cushing 
costs and expenses  excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil  decreased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  operating  general and administrative expenses decreased million from the prior year due to million of environmental costs recognized in and decreased labor related costs  partially offset by increased general and administrative supplies and services expense and environmental costs recognized in  primarily related to the shelby site see note commitments and contingencies in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million due to increased depreciation expense on the assets acquired from valero and from the acquisition of a lubrication oil distributor in amarillo  texas  partially offset by lower amortization costs from the adoption of sfas effective january   in which goodwill and excess investment are no longer being amortized 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million due to reductions in property tax accruals 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in operating fuel and power costs attributed to higher transportation volumes 
equity earnings in seaway for the year ended december   increased million from the year ended december   due to higher third party transportation volumes 
this increase was partially offset by our portion of equity earnings being reduced from to on a pro rated basis in averaging approximately for the year ended december  
equity earnings in seaway were affected in as a result of the reduction of the sharing percentages of tctm under the seaway partnership agreement 
beginning in june  our participation in seaway decreased from of revenue and expense of seaway to

year ended december  compared to year ended december  our upstream segment reported earnings before interest of million for the year ended december   compared with earnings before interest of million for the year ended december  earnings before interest increased million primarily due to an increase of million in margin  an increase of million in other operating revenues  an increase of million in equity earnings of seaway and an increase of million in other income net 
these increases were partially offset by an increase of million in costs and expenses excluding purchases of crude oil and petroleum products 
we discuss the factors influencing these variances below 
our margin increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  crude oil transportation margin increased million primarily due to a full year benefit from the arco assets acquired in july and higher volumes on the red river and south texas systems  which benefited from increased regional crude oil production and pipeline assets acquired from valero in march crude oil marketing margin increased million primarily due to volumes transported by seaway on behalf of the upstream segment 
the transportation revenues associated with these volumes resulted in million included as a component of crude oil marketing margin when consolidating the upstream segment s equity ownership in seaway 
lower margins on other crude oil volumes marketed partially offset the increase in crude oil marketing margin 
crude oil terminaling margin increased million as a result of pumpover volumes at midland and cushing  related to the arco assets acquired in july margin contributed from lubrication oil sales increased million primarily due to increased volumes and increased rates on the margin realized per gallon 
other operating revenue of the upstream segment increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase is attributable to revenue from documentation and other services to support customer trading activity at midland and cushing 
these revenues were added to our business on july   with the acquired arco assets 
costs and expenses  excluding expenses associated with purchases of crude oil and lubrication oil  increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december  the increase was comprised of an increase of million in operating  general and administrative expenses  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense  an increase of million in taxes other than income taxes and an increase of million in operating fuel and power expense 
the increase in operating  general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to operating expenses of the acquired assets from arco  defs and valero  million of expense recorded in for environmental remediation  increased labor related costs and increased general and administrative supplies and services expense 
the increases in depreciation and amortization expense  taxes other than income taxes and operating fuel and power expense were primarily attributable to assets acquired

ngl transportation revenues increased million  primarily due to the acquisition of the chaparral ngl system on march   partially offset by lower revenues on a take or pay contract on the dean pipeline system that was in effect until the bankruptcy of enron corp 
in december the decrease in the ngl transportation average rate per barrel resulted from the cancellation of the enron corp 
take or pay contract and a lower average rate per barrel on volumes transported on chaparral 
costs and expenses increased million during the year ended december   compared with the year ended december   due to an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense  an increase of million in operating  general and administrative expense  an increase of million in operating fuel and power costs and an increase of million in taxes other than income taxes

in august  te products entered into agreements with pepl and marathon to form centennial 
centennial owns an interstate refined petroleum products pipeline extending from the upper texas gulf coast to illinois 
during the years ended december  and  te products contributed approximately million and million  respectively  for its investment in centennial 
these amounts are included in our equity investment balance at december  and through february   each original participant owned a one third interest in centennial 
on february   te products and marathon each acquired an additional interest in centennial  bringing their ownership interest to each 
excluding te products purchase of its additional ownership interest of on february   we expect to contribute an additional million to centennial in centennial entered into credit facilities totaling million  and as of december   million was outstanding under those credit facilities 
the proceeds were used to fund construction and conversion costs of its pipeline system 
each of the participants in centennial  including te products  originally guaranteed one third of centennial s debt  up to a maximum amount of million 
during the third quarter of  pepl  one of the participants in centennial  was downgraded by moody s and standard poors to below investment grade  which resulted in pepl being in default under its portion of the centennial guaranty 
effective september   te products and marathon increased their guaranteed amounts to one half of the debt of centennial  up to a maximum amount of million each  to avoid a default on the centennial debt 
as compensation to te products and marathon for providing their additional guarantees  pepl was required to pay interest at a rate of per annum to each of te products and marathon on the portion of the additional guaranty that each had provided for pepl 
in connection with the acquisition of the additional interest in centennial on february   the guaranty agreement between te products  marathon and pepl was terminated 
te products guaranty of up to a maximum of million of centennial s debt remains in effect 
in february  we entered into a joint marketing and development alliance with louis dreyfus in which our mont belvieu lpgs storage and transportation shuttle system services were jointly marketed by louis dreyfus and te products 
the purpose of the alliance was to expand services to the upper texas gulf coast energy marketplace by increasing pipeline throughput and the mix of products handled through the existing system and establishing new receipt and delivery connections 
the alliance was a service oriented  fee based venture with no commodity trading activity 
te products operated the facilities for the alliance 
under the alliance  louis dreyfus invested million for expansion projects at mont belvieu 
the alliance also stipulated that if certain earnings thresholds were achieved  a partnership between te products and louis dreyfus was to be created effective january  all terms and earnings thresholds have been met  therefore  we will be contributing our mont belvieu assets to the newly formed partnership 
the economic terms of the partnership are the same as those under the joint development and marketing alliance 
te products will continue to operate the facilities for the partnership 
the net book value of the mont belvieu assets that we are contributing to the partnership is approximately million 
our interest in the partnership will be accounted for as an equity investment 
credit facilities and interest rate swap agreements on july   we entered into a million term loan and million revolving credit facility three year facility

future capital needs and commitments we estimate that capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for will be approximately million which includes million of capitalized interest 
we expect to use approximately million for revenue generating projects 
capital spending on revenue generating projects will include approximately million for the expansion of our pumping capacity of lpgs into the northeast markets  approximately million for expansion of our downstream segment s deliverability capacity  million to expand upstream segment facilities and approximately million for the expansion of midstream assets 
we expect to spend approximately million to sustain existing operations  of which approximately million will be for downstream segment pipeline projects  including the replacement of storage tanks  pipeline rehabilitation projects to comply with regulations enacted by the ops and the installation of replacement electrical distribution facilities at our mont belvieu facilities  million for upgrades of our upstream segment and million of capital expenditures to sustain existing operations on the midstream segment 
an additional million will be expended on system upgrade projects among all of our business segments 
we continually review and evaluate potential capital improvements and expansions that would be complementary to our present business segments 
these expenditures can vary greatly depending on the magnitude of our transactions 
we may finance capital expenditures through internally generated funds  debt or the issuance of additional equity 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
in the event of any working capital shortfalls  we have approximately million in available borrowing capacity under our three year facility to cover these items

we expect to repay the long term  senior unsecured obligations and bank debt through the issuance of additional long term senior unsecured debt at the time the  and debt matures  issuance of additional equity  proceeds from dispositions of assets  cash flow from operations or any combination of the above items 
sources of future capital historically  we have funded our capital commitments from operating cash flow and borrowings under bank credit facilities or bridge loans 
we repaid these loans in part by the issuance of long term debt in capital markets and the public offering of limited partner units 
we expect future capital needs would be similarly funded to the extent not otherwise available from cash flow from operations 
as of december   we had approximately million in combined available borrowing capacity under the three year facility and the short term revolver 
in february  we gave notice that we will not renew the short term revolver 
as a result  the short term revolver will expire on march  we expect that cash flows from operating activities will be adequate to fund cash distributions and capital additions necessary to sustain existing operations 
however  expansionary capital projects and acquisitions may require funding through proceeds from the sale of additional debt or equity capital markets offerings 
on may   moody s investors service downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to baa from baa our subsidiary  te products was also included in this downgrade 
these ratings were given with stable outlooks and followed our announcement of the acquisition of val verde 
the downgrades reflect moody s concern that we have a high level of debt relative to many of our peers and that our debt may be continually higher than our long term targets if we continue to make a series of acquisitions of increasingly larger size 
because of our high distribution rate  we are particularly reliant on external financing to finance our acquisitions 
moody s indicated that our cash flows are becoming less predictable as a result of our acquisitions and expansion into the crude oil and natural gas gathering businesses 
further reductions in our credit ratings could increase the debt financing costs or possibly reduce the availability of financing 
a rating reflects only the view of a rating agency and is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any indebtedness 
any rating can be revised upward or downward or withdrawn at any time by a rating agency if it decides that the circumstances warrant such a change 
on january   moody s reaffirmed the baa ratings on us and our subsidiary  te products 
other considerations credit risks risks of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers are a major consideration in our businesses 
our credit procedures and policies do not fully eliminate customer credit risk

in  we expensed a receivable for transportation fees of approximately million  or approximately per limited partner and class b unit because of the bankruptcy of enron corp 
and certain of its subsidiaries in december terrorist threats on september   the united states was the target of terrorist attacks of unprecedented scale 
since the september attacks  the united states government has issued warnings that energy assets  specifically the nation s pipeline infrastructure  could be a future target of terrorist organizations 
these developments have subjected our operations to increased risks 
any terrorist attack on our facilities  customers facilities and  in some cases  those of other pipelines  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we have increased security initiatives and are working with various governmental agencies to minimize risks associated with additional terrorist attacks 
environmental our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of injunctions delaying or prohibiting certain activities and the need to perform investigatory and remedial activities 
although we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  risks of significant costs and liabilities are inherent in pipeline operations  and we cannot assure you that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
moreover  it is possible that other developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and enforcement policies thereunder  and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations  could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us 
we believe that changes in environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the near term 
in  we entered into an agreed order with the idem that resulted in the implementation of a remediation program for groundwater contamination attributable to our operations at the seymour terminal 
in  the idem approved a feasibility study  which includes our proposed remediation program 
in march  the idem issued a record of decision formally approving the remediation program 
as the record of decision has been issued  we will enter into an agreed order for the continued operation and maintenance of the remediation program 
we have an accrued liability of million at december   for future remediation costs at the seymour terminal 
we do not expect that the completion of the remediation program will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in  the ldeq issued a compliance order for environmental contamination at our arcadia  louisiana  facility 
this contamination may be attributable to our operations  as well as adjacent petroleum terminals operated by other companies 
in  our arcadia facility and adjacent terminals were directed by the remediation services division of the ldeq to pursue remediation of this containment phase 
at december   we have an accrued liability of million for remediation costs at our arcadia facility 
we do not expect that the completion of the remediation program that we have proposed will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
at december   we had an accrued liability of million and a receivable of million from defs related to various tctm sites requiring environmental remediation activities 
the receivable is based on a contractual indemnity obligation we received in connection with our acquisition of assets from a defs affiliate in november the indemnity relates to future environmental remediation activities attributable to operations of these assets prior to our acquisition 
under this indemnity obligation  we are responsible for the first million in specified environmental liabilities  and defs is responsible for those environmental liabilities in excess of million  up to a maximum amount of million 
the majority of the receivable from defs relates to remediation activities at the velma crude oil site in stephens county  oklahoma 
the accrued liability balance at december   also includes an accrual of million related to the shelby crude oil site in stephens county  oklahoma 
at december   it is uncertain if these costs related to shelby are covered under the indemnity obligation from defs 
we are currently in discussions with defs regarding these matters 
we do not expect that the completion of remediation programs associated with tctm activities will have a future material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
market based rates on may   te products filed an application with the ferc requesting permission to charge market based rates for substantially all refined products transportation tariffs 
on july   the ferc issued an order granting te products market based rates in certain markets and set for hearing te products application for market based rates in certain destination markets and origin markets 
after the matter was set for hearing  te products and the protesting shippers entered into a settlement agreement resolving their respective differences

as a result of the settlement  te products recognized approximately million of previously deferred transportation revenue in the second quarter of as a part of the settlement  te products withdrew the application for market based rates to the little rock  arkansas  and arcadia and shreveport arcadia  louisiana  destination markets  which are currently subject to the ppi index 
as a result  we made refunds of approximately million in the third quarter of for those destination markets 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas requires us to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation for the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
a corresponding asset is also recorded and depreciated over the life of the asset 
after the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the liability will be adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
we will adopt sfas effective january  determination of any amounts to be recognized upon adoption is based upon numerous estimates and assumptions  including future retirement costs  future inflation rates and the credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
the downstream segment assets consist primarily of a pipeline system and a series of storage facilities that originate along the upper texas gulf coast and extend through the midwest and northeastern united states 
we transport refined products  lpgs and petrochemicals through the pipeline system 
these products are primarily received in the south end of the system and stored and or transported to various points along the system per customer nominations 
the upstream segment s operations include purchasing crude oil from producers at the wellhead and providing delivery  storage and other services to its customers and the distribution of lubrication oils and specialty chemicals 
the properties in the upstream segment consist of interstate trunk pipelines  pump stations  trucking facilities  storage tanks and various gathering systems primarily in texas and oklahoma 
the midstream segment gathers natural gas from producers and transports natural gas and ngls on its pipeline systems  primarily in texas  wyoming  new mexico and colorado 
the midstream segment also owns and operates two ngl fractionating facilities in colorado 
the fair value of the asset retirement obligations for our trunk and interstate pipelines and our surface facilities cannot be reasonably estimated  as future dismantlement and removal dates are indeterminate 
we will record such asset retirement obligations in the period in which we determine the settlement dates of the retirement obligations 
other assets in which future operating lives may be determinable include our gathering assets in our midstream and upstream segments 
however  our rights of way agreements  in general  do not require us to remove pipe or otherwise perform restoration upon taking the pipelines permanently out of service 
we are continuing to evaluate the effect of sfas on our midstream and upstream gathering assets  but we do not currently anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

sfas requires recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred  as opposed to when the entity commits to an exit plan under eitf no

in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on the reported results 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas did not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
fin also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
fin requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  which is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin see note commitments and contingencies and will apply the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after december  to date  we have not entered into or modified guarantees pursuant to the provisions of fin in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no
