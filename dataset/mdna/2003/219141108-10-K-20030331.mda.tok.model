item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a leading provider of privatized correctional  treatment and educational services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies 
the company provides a diversified portfolio of services for adults and juveniles through its three operating divisions adult secure institutional services  juvenile treatment  education and detention services and pre release correctional and treatment services 
as of december   the company had facilities with a total service capacity of  including the new morgan academy  which was closed in the fourth quarter of  and the moshannon valley correctional center  which is under development 
the company s facilities are located in states and the district of columbia 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated total service capacity  the service capacity and contracted beds in operation at the end of the periods shown and average occupancy percentages 
year ended december  total service capacity residential non residential community based total service capacity in operation end of period contracted beds in operation end of period average occupancy based on contracted beds in operation average occupancy excluding start up operations the company s service capacity is comprised of the number of beds available for service upon completion of construction of residential facilities and the average program capacity of non residential community based programs 
occupancy percentages are based on contracted service capacity of residential facilities in operation 
since certain facilities have service capacities that exceed contracted capacities  occupancy percentages can exceed of contracted capacity 
occupancy percentages reflect less than normalized occupancy during the start up phase of any applicable facility  resulting in a lower average occupancy in periods when the company has substantial start up activities 
the company derives substantially all its revenues from providing corrections  treatment and educational services outsourced by federal  state and local government agencies in the united states 
revenues for the company s services are generally recognized on a per diem rate based upon the number of occupant days or hours served for the period  on a guaranteed take or pay basis or on a cost plus reimbursement basis 
revenues may fluctuate from year to year due to changes in government funding policies  the number of people referred to the company s facilities by governmental agencies or the opening of additional facilities 
factors that the company considers in determining the per diem rate to charge include the programs specified by the contract and the related staffing levels  wage levels customary in the respective geographic areas  whether the proposed facility is to be leased or purchased and the anticipated average occupancy levels that the company believes could reasonably be maintained 
the company has historically experienced higher operating margins in its adult secure institutional and pre release divisions as compared to the juvenile division 
additionally  the company s operating margins within a division can vary from facility to facility based on whether a facility is owned or leased  the level of competition for the contract award  the proposed length of the contract  the occupancy levels for a facility  the level of capital commitment required with respect to a facility  the anticipated changes in operating costs over the term of the contract  and the company s ability to increase a facility s contract revenue 
a decline in occupancy of certain juvenile division facilities may have a more significant impact on operating results than the adult secure division due to higher per diem revenues of certain juvenile facilities 
the company has experienced and expects to experience interim period operating margin fluctuations due to the number of calendar days in the period  higher payroll taxes in the first half of the year  and salary and wage increases that are incurred prior to certain contract revenue increases 
the company experienced higher employee insurance costs in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to rising medical costs 
the company is responsible for all facility operating costs  except for certain debt service and lease payments with respect to facilities for which the company has only a management contract facilities in operation at december  and and nine facilities in 
a majority of the company s facility operating costs consists of fixed costs 
these fixed costs include lease and rental expense  insurance  utilities and depreciation 
as a result  when the company commences operation of new or expanded facilities  fixed operating cost increase 
the amount of the company s variable operating costs  including food  medical services  supplies and clothing  depend on occupancy levels at the facilities operated by the company 
the company s largest single operating cost  facility payroll expense and related employment taxes and costs  has both a fixed and a variable component 
the company can adjust a facility s staffing levels and the related payroll expense to a certain extent based on occupancy at a facility  however a minimum fixed number of employees is required to operate and maintain any facility regardless of occupancy levels 
personnel costs are subject to increases in tightening labor markets based on local economic and other conditions 
following a contract award  the company incurs pre opening and start up expenses including payroll  benefits  training and other operating costs prior to opening a new or expanded facility and during the period of operation while occupancy is ramping up 
these costs vary by contract 
since pre opening and start up costs are factored into the revenue per diem rate that is charged to the contracting agency  the company typically expects to recover these upfront costs over the life of the contract 
because occupancy rates during a facility s start up phase typically result in capacity under utilization for at least to days  the company may incur additional post opening start up costs 
the company does not anticipate post opening start up costs at facilities operated under any future contracts with the bop because these contracts are currently and expected to continue to be take or pay contracts  meaning that the bop will pay the company at least of the contractual monthly revenue once the facility opens regardless of actual occupancy 
newly opened facilities are staffed according to contract requirements when the company begins receiving offenders or clients 
offenders or clients are typically assigned to a newly opened facility on a phased in basis over a one to six month period  although certain programs require a longer time period to reach break even occupancy levels 
the company incurs start up operating losses at new facilities until break even occupancy levels are reached 
although the company typically recovers these upfront costs over the life of the contract  quarterly results can be substantially affected by the timing of the commencement of operations as well as development and construction of new facilities 
working capital requirements generally increase immediately prior to the company s commencing management of a new or expanded facility as the company incurs start up costs and purchases necessary equipment and supplies before facility management revenue is realized 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for the company s corporate and administrative personnel who provide senior management  finance  accounting  human resources  payroll and information systems  costs of business development and outside professional fees

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that the company s management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant adjustments and estimates used in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and interests in partnerships that are special purpose entities or may be virtual special purpose entities pursuant for which the company owns no partnership interest  but for financial reporting purposes only  has consolidated such special purpose entities as discussed below 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
minority interest in consolidated special purpose entities represents equity that other investors have contributed to the special purpose entities 
minority interest is adjusted for income and losses allocable to the owners of the special purpose entities 
as the cumulative losses of the special purpose entity exceed the equity which is recorded as minority interest by the company  the excess losses are recorded in the company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income 
the company s lease financing arrangement under its credit facility is a synthetic lease 
a synthetic lease is a form of lease financing that qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment and  when all criteria pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap are met  are accounted for  off balance sheet 
under such a structure  the owner lessor of the properties synthetic lease investor may be considered a virtual special purpose entity when it obtains debt and equity capital to finance the acquisition or construction of project s and leases the projects to a company 
this financial structure was used to finance the construction of the new morgan academy completed in the first quarter of  the acquisition of the taylor street center building in early  and the construction to date costs of the moshannon valley correctional center 
the synthetic lease used by the company to finance the above projects was executed in december and was amended in july whereby the available financing was increased from million to million and the lease term extended to july under current accounting rules  the synthetic lease investor in a virtual spe must maintain at least a equity ownership interest in the property throughout the life of the lease 
the company s synthetic lease documents  as amended in july  provide for the equity investor to fund of project costs 
there are provisions in the lease and related credit documents for the lenders and synthetic lease investor to fund and be paid interest  yield and fees 
under current gaap rules  the payment of any yield and fees to the investors is required to be treated as a return of capital rather than a return on capital 
the synthetic lease investor for the above mentioned projects received payments to act as co arranger in the structure of the initial million synthetic lease facility in and in july when the synthetic lease facility was increased to million 
although the company does not believe the lessor of the synthetic lease is a special purpose entity  the lessor is considered a virtual special purpose entity under certain accounting interpretations 
therefore  the payments discussed above could be interpreted to reduce the synthetic lease investor s equity ownership in the above leased projects below the required level as of the second quarter of pursuant to this interpretation  the company s synthetic leases no longer qualified for off balance sheet treatment as of the beginning of the second quarter of accordingly  the assets and liabilities and the related results of operations of the synthetic lease owned by the synthetic lease investor have been consolidated in the company s financial statements as of that time 
as a result of consolidating the synthetic lease assets and liabilities  the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect  among other things  the depreciation expense on the associated properties and interest expense related to the synthetic lease investor s debt instead of rent expense 
for income tax purposes  the company recognizes rent expense pursuant to the terms of its lease with the synthetic lease investor and does not consolidate the assets  liabilities or the results of operations of the synthetic lease investor

the company received million of proceeds from the sale of these facilities 
the proceeds were used to repay million of the company s long term debt and the remainder was invested in short term securities  million of this amount being invested in securities to be held as collateral for the company s credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
mcf is an unaffiliated special purpose entity spe 
under current accounting rules  an spe s equity investor must maintain at least a equity ownership interest in the property throughout the life of the lease 
in september  the company entered into a retainer agreement with an affiliate of the equity investor in mcf mcf equity investor  and in november  paid the mcf equity investor a retainer fee of million for financial advisory services related to potential future financing projects and the strategic development of the company s business 
under certain accounting interpretations  this retainer has been deemed to reduce the equity investment in mcf to below the required level 
as a result  the company has consolidated the assets  liabilities  and the results of operations of mcf in the company s accompanying consolidated financial statements as of august  as a result of consolidating the assets and liabilities of mcf  the company s consolidated financial statements reflect  among other things  the depreciation expense on the associated properties and interest expense on the bond debt of mcf used to finance mcf s acquisition of the facilities in the sale and leaseback transaction  instead of rent expense 
for income tax purposes  the company recognizes rent expense pursuant to the terms of its lease with mcf and does not consolidate the assets  liabilities or the results of operations of mcf 
the cumulative losses of mcf exceeded the recorded minority interest of mcf during the first quarter of the cumulative losses of the synthetic lease investor exceeded the recorded minority interest of the synthetic lease investor during the third quarter of since the cumulative losses of mcf and the synthetic lease investor exceed the equity that was recorded as minority interest by the company  the excess losses can no longer be allocated to the minority interest in the company s consolidated statements of operations in in the year ended december   the company recorded minority interest expense of approximately million as a result of a distribution made by mcf to its equity investors

with this in mind  you should consider the risks discussed elsewhere in this report and other documents the company files with the commission from time to time and the following important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement made by the company or on its behalf 
public resistance to privatization of correctional and detention facilities could result in the company s inability to obtain new contracts or the loss of existing contracts 
management of correctional and detention facilities by private entities has not achieved complete acceptance by either the government or the public 
the movement toward privatization of correctional and detention facilities has also encountered resistance from certain groups  such as labor unions  local sheriff s departments  and groups believing that correctional and detention facility operations should only be conducted by government agencies 
changes in the dominant political party in any market in which correctional facilities are located could have an adverse impact on privatization 
further  some government agencies are not legally permitted to delegate their traditional management responsibilities for correctional and detention facilities to private companies 
any of these resistances may make it more difficult for the company to renew or maintain existing contracts  to obtain new contracts or sites on which to operate new facilities or to develop or purchase facilities and lease them to government or private entities  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is subject to the short term nature of government contracts 
many governmental agencies are legally limited in their ability to enter into long term contracts that would bind elected officials responsible for future budgets 
therefore  many contracts with government agencies typically either have a very short term or are subject to termination on short notice without cause 
in addition  the company s contracts with government agencies may contain one or more renewal options that may be exercised only by the contracting government agency 
no assurance can be given that any agency will exercise a renewal option in the future 
the non renewal or termination of any of the company s significant contracts with governmental agencies could materially adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operation and liquidity  including its ability to secure new facility management contracts from others 
the company is dependent on government appropriations 
if government appropriation levels are reduced  the company s business may be harmed 
the company s cash flow is subject to the receipt of sufficient funding of and timely payment by contracting governmental entities 
if the appropriate governmental agency does not receive sufficient appropriations to cover its contractual obligations  a contract may be terminated or the amounts payable to the company may be deferred or reduced 
any delays in payment  or the termination of a significant contract  could have an adverse effect on the company s cash flow and financial condition 
moreover  as a result of the slowing economy and the events of september   federal  state and local governments may encounter unusual budgetary constraints and there is a risk that spending on outsourced services provided by the company may be curtailed 
the company s ability to win new contracts to develop and manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities depends on many factors outside its control 
the company s growth is generally dependent upon its ability to win new contracts to develop and manage new correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
this depends on a number of factors the company cannot control  including crime rates and sentencing patterns in various jurisdictions 
accordingly  the demand for the company s facilities could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts  leniency in conviction and sentencing practices or through the legal decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by criminal laws 
for instance  any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested  convicted and sentenced  thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them 
similarly  reductions in crime rates could lead to reductions in arrests  convictions and sentences requiring correctional facilities 
the bureau of justice statistics reports that the level of violent crime in the united states has declined steadily since and the level of property crime is at the lowest level since however  the number of detained offenders has grown steadily during that period 
while the company believes that governments will continue to privatize correctional  detention and treatment facilities  the company believes the rate of growth experienced in the state private corrections industry during the late s and early s is moderating 
certain jurisdictions recently have required successful bidders to make a significant capital investment in connection with the financing of a particular project  a trend that could require the company to have sufficient capital resources to compete effectively 
the company may not be able to obtain these capital resources when needed 
additionally  the company s success in obtaining new awards and contracts may depend  in part  upon its ability to locate land that can be leased or acquired under favorable terms 
otherwise desirable locations may be in or near populated areas and  therefore  may generate legal action or other forms of opposition from residents in areas surrounding a proposed site 
the company is currently negotiating a contract amendment with the bop related to the moshannon valley correctional center 
if the company is unable to successfully negotiate the amendment with the bop or if the company is unable to obtain the re approval of the project by the lenders under the company s amended credit facility  the company will be unable to move forward with the construction and operation of the facility 
the company s profitability may suffer if the number of offenders occupying its correctional  detention and treatment facilities decreases 
the company s correctional  detention and treatment facilities are dependent upon government agencies supplying offenders 
a substantial portion of the company s revenues is generated under contracts that specify a net rate per day per resident  or a per diem rate  sometimes with no minimum guaranteed occupancy levels  even though most correctional facility cost structures are relatively fixed 
under such a per diem rate structure  a decrease in occupancy levels at a particular facility could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations at such facility 
a failure to comply with existing regulations could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of the company s contracts to manage correctional  detention and treatment facilities 
the company s industry is subject to a variety of federal  state and local regulations  including education  health care and safety regulations  which are administered by various regulatory authorities 
the company may not always successfully comply with these regulations  and failure to comply could result in material penalties or non renewal or termination of facility management contracts 
the contracts typically include extensive reporting requirements and supervision and on site monitoring by representatives of contracting government agencies 
corrections officers are customarily required to meet certain training standards  and in some instances facility personnel are required to be licensed and subject to background investigation 
certain jurisdictions also require the subcontracts to be awarded on a competitive basis or to subcontract with businesses owned by members of minority groups 
the company s facilities are also subject to operational and financial audits by the governmental agencies with which the company has contracts 
the failure to comply with any applicable laws  rules or regulations and the loss of any required license could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations at the company s affected facilities 
government agencies may investigate and audit the company s contracts and  if any improprieties are found  the company may be required to refund revenues it has received  to forego anticipated revenues and may be subject to penalties and sanctions  including prohibitions on the company s bidding in response to requests for proposals  or rfps 
certain of the government agencies the company contracts with have the authority to audit and investigate the company s contracts with them 
as part of that process  the government agency reviews the company s performance on the contract  its pricing practices  its cost structure and its compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the agency determines that the company has improperly allocated costs to a specific contract  the company may not be reimbursed for those costs and the company could be required to refund the amount of any such costs that have been reimbursed 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by the company or the company otherwise determines that these activities have occurred  the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any adverse determination could adversely impact the company s ability to bid in response to rfps in one or more jurisdictions 
if the company fails to satisfy its contractual obligations  the company s ability to compete for future contracts and its financial condition may be adversely affected 
the company s failure to comply with contract requirements or to meet its client s performance expectations when performing a contract could materially and adversely affect the company s financial performance and its reputation  which  in turn  would impact the company s ability to compete for new contracts 
the company s failure to meet contractual obligations could also result in substantial actual and consequential damages 
in addition  the company s contracts often require it to indemnify clients for the company s failure to meet performance standards 
some of the company s contracts contain liquidated damages provisions and financial penalties related to performance failures 
although the company has liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
new competitors in the company s industry may adversely affect the profitability of the company s business 
the company must compete on the basis of cost  quality and range of services offered  experience in managing facilities  reputation of personnel and ability to design  finance and construct new facilities on a cost effective competitive basis 
while there are barriers for companies seeking to enter into the management and operation of correctional  detention and treatment facilities  there can be no assurance that these barriers will be sufficient to limit additional competition 
a disturbance in one of the company s facilities could result in closure of a facility or harm to the company s business 
an escape  riot or other disturbance at one of the company s facilities could adversely effect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company s operations 
among other things  the adverse publicity generated as a result of an event could adversely affect the company s ability to retain an existing contract or obtain future ones 
in addition  if such an event were to occur  there is a possibility that the facility where the event occurred may be shut down by the relevant governmental agency 
a closure of certain of the company s facilities could adversely affect the financial condition  results of operations and liquidity of the company s operations 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets in which the company s common stock trades  the markets in which the company operates and the company s profitability 
terrorist attacks may negatively affect the company s operations 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the united states or united states businesses 
as a result of terrorism  the united states may enter into a protracted armed conflict  which could have a further impact on the company s business 
in addition  terrorists attacks in the united states may increase demand for trained security personnel  which could increase the company s operating costs 
political and economic instability in some regions of the world may also result and could negatively impact the company s business 
in addition  any of these events may affect the markets in which the company s common stock trades 
the consequences of any of these armed conflicts are unpredictable and the company may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on its business 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could adversely affect the company s reputation and its ability to bid for government contracts 
the media frequently focuses its attention on private operators contracts with government agencies 
if the media coverage is negative  it could influence government officials to slow the pace of outsourcing government services  which could reduce the number of rfps 
the media may also focus its attention on the activities of political consultants engaged by the company  even when their activities are unrelated to the company s business  and the company may be tainted by adverse media coverage about their activities 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about the company could harm its reputation and  accordingly  its ability to bid for and win government contracts 
the company may incur significant costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when the company is awarded a contract to manage a government program  it may incur significant expenses before the company receives contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring and training personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program pre opening and start up costs  the company may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to the company from government agencies may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve governmental budgets and finalize contracts in a timely manner 
the company may be unable to attract and retain sufficient qualified personnel necessary to sustain its business 
the company s delivery of services is labor intensive 
when the company is awarded a government contract  the company must hire operating management  security  case management and other personnel 
the success of the company s business requires that the company attract  develop  motivate and retain these personnel 
the company s inability to hire sufficient personnel on a timely basis or the loss of significant numbers of personnel could adversely affect its business 
unsuccessful financing or acquisition projects may result in charges to expense for deferred costs 
if the company determines that one or more financing or acquisition projects is unlikely to be successfully concluded  the company could incur significant charges to expense for deferred costs associated with such projects 
failure to obtain additional capital in the future could reduce the company s ability to grow 
the company believes that existing cash and cash equivalents and the cash flows generated from operations  together with the company s revolving credit available under the amended credit facility  and the lease capacity thereunder  will be adequate to fund the company s operating plans for the foreseeable future 
however  the company may need additional debt or equity financing in order to carry out its growth strategy 
to the extent that the company requires additional financing in the future and is unable to obtain such additional financing on satisfactory terms  if at all  it may not be able to fully implement its growth strategy 
if the company does not successfully integrate the businesses that it acquires  the company s results of operations could be adversely affected 
the company may be unable to manage businesses that it may acquire profitably or integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
moreover  business combinations involve additional risks  including diversion of management s attention  loss of key personnel  assumption of unanticipated legal or financial liabilities  the company s becoming significantly leveraged as a result of the incurrence of debt to finance an acquisition  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  amortization or charges of acquired intangible assets  including goodwill  and dilution to the company s earnings per share 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired business could materially and adversely affect the company s reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenues and earnings the company anticipated 
because federal environmental laws impose strict as well as joint and several liability for clean up costs  unforeseen environmental risks could prove to be costly 
the company s facilities may be subject to unforeseen environmental risks 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as amended  or cercla  imposes strict  as well as joint and several  liability for certain environmental cleanup costs on several classes of potentially responsible parties  including current owners and operators of the property and  in some cases  lenders who did not cause or contribute to the contamination 
furthermore  liability under cercla is not limited to the original or unamortized principal balance of a loan or to the value of the property securing a loan 
other federal and state laws in certain circumstances may impose liability for environmental remediation  which costs may be substantial 
moreover  certain federal statutes and certain states by statute impose a lien for any cleanup costs incurred by such state on the property that is the subject of such cleanup costs 
all subsequent liens on such property generally are subordinated to such an environmental lien and  in some states  even prior recorded liens are subordinated to environmental liens 
the company is the subject of class action lawsuits that  if decided against it  could have a negative effect on its financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and future prospects 
in march and april  the company  steven w 
logan  and john l 
hendrix  have been named as defendants in four federal putative class action lawsuits styled as follows graydon williams  on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v 
cornell companies  inc  et al  no

scolaro  on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated v 
cornell companies  inc  et al  no 
h  in the united states district court for the southern district of texas  houston division 
the aforementioned lawsuits are putative class action lawsuits brought on behalf of all purchasers of the company s common stock between march  and march  the lawsuits involve disclosures made concerning two prior transactions executed by the company the august sale leaseback transaction and the synthetic lease transaction 
these four lawsuits have all been consolidated into the graydon williams action 
recently  the court granted flyline partners  lp s motion to be appointed as lead plaintiff and flyline partners  lp has filed a consolidated complaint 
the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants violated section b of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  rule b promulgated under section b of the exchange act  section a of the exchange act and section of the securities exchange act of the consolidated complaint seeks  among other things  restitution damages  compensatory damages  rescission or rescissory measure of damages  costs  expenses  attorneys fees and expert fees 
in march  the company  its directors  and its former independent auditor arthur andersen llp  were sued in a derivative action styled as william williams  derivatively and on behalf of nominal defendant cornell companies  inc v 
anthony r 
chase  et al  no 
 in the th judicial district court of harris county  texas 
the lawsuit alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by all of the individual defendants and asserts breach of contract and professional negligence claims only against arthur andersen llp 
in may and june  the company and its directors were sued in three other derivative lawsuits styled as follows juan guitierrez  derivatively on behalf of cornell companies  inc v 
steven w 
logan  et

steven w 
logan  et 
al  no 
 in the th judicial district court of harris county  texas 
these lawsuits all allege breaches of fiduciary duty and waste of corporate assets by all of the defendants 
a motion to dismiss the guitierrez and pagano lawsuits was filed 
the court dismissed the pagano action as duplicative of the guitierrez action 
the motion to dismiss the guitierrez action is still pending 
while the plaintiffs in these cases have not quantified their claim of damages and the outcome of the matters discussed above cannot be predicted with certainty  based on information known to date  if the plaintiffs are successful management believes that the ultimate resolution of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  operating results or cash flow 
certain insurance policies held by the company to cover potential director and officer liability may limit the company s cash outflows in the event of a decision adverse to the company in the matters discussed above 
however  if an adverse decision in these matters exceeds the insurance coverage or if the insurance coverage is deemed not to apply to these matters  an adverse decision to the company in these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company  its financial condition  its results of operations and its future prospects
