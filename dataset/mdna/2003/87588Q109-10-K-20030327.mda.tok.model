item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview tanox discovers and develops therapeutic monoclonal antibodies to address significant unmet medical needs in the areas of asthma  allergy  inflammation and other diseases affecting the human immune system 
tanox s products are genetically engineered antibodies that target a specific molecule  or antigen 
in  we discovered a novel approach for treating allergies and asthma by using anti immunoglobulin e  or anti ige  antibodies capable of blocking ige  a causative agent of the allergy pathway  thus preventing the onset of disease symptoms 
xolair  our most advanced product  is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks ige 
its therapeutic effect has been validated through clinical trials in patients suffering from allergic asthma  seasonal allergic rhinitis hay fever and perennial allergic rhinitis 
we are developing xolair in collaboration with novartis and genentech 
in june  our collaboration partners filed a bla with the fda and a submission for marketing approval with health authorities in the eu  switzerland  australia  and new zealand for allergic asthma and hay fever in adults  adolescents and children 
following receipt of a complete response letter from the fda in july and treatment of additional patients to expand the safety database  our collaboration partners submitted an amendment to the bla in december for moderate to severe allergic asthma in adults and adolescents 
the fda s pulmonary allergy drugs advisory committee is scheduled to review the bla on may  in june  xolair was approved for marketing in adolescents and adults with moderate allergic asthma in australia 
using our knowledge of the human immune system  we are building a diverse pipeline of monoclonal antibody product candidates 
tnx  a humanized anti ige monoclonal antibody distinct from xolair  was tested in a double blinded  placebo controlled phase clinical trial in peanut allergy patients after four months of treatment  significant decreases in sensitivity to peanuts was demonstrated by oral food challenge 
following an adverse arbitration ruling in october  we halted further development of tnx pending further discussions with genentech and novartis 
tnx  an anti cd antibody  is currently in a phase b trial for treating hiv infected patients the phase a study was completed in and demonstrated clinically important greater than one log decreases in viral load 
tnx  a complement factor d inhibiting antibody  is in preclinical studies for treating complement mediated diseases 
we are also conducting target discovery and target validation research on several new targets implicated in allergies and other immune mediated disorders 
we currently have no products available for sale 
we are focusing our efforts on research and product development activities necessary to advance our product opportunities  including process development and clinical trial activities for products that are currently in the clinic or will commence clinical development in the future 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and incurred an accumulated deficit through december   of million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future  particularly as we expand our research and development activities  produce clinical material and initiate additional clinical trials 
we expect that losses will continue until such time  if ever  that we generate sufficient revenue from xolair and potentially from another marketed product or products 
historically  we have earned revenues primarily from milestone payments  license fees and sponsored research under our collaboration agreements 
over the next several years  we expect our principal revenues will be milestone payments  royalties and profit sharing payments from novartis and genentech 
we may also receive royalties from roche should it participate in selling xolair in europe 
our revenues will depend particularly on the success of our collaboration partners in developing  manufacturing  obtaining regulatory approvals for and marketing xolair 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and commercialization milestones  we anticipate that our results of operations will vary substantially from year to year and even quarter to quarter 
critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
cash  cash equivalents and investments cash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less 
management determines the appropriate classification of its cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments at the time of purchase 
investments consist of investment grade corporate bonds  commercial paper  assets backed securities  and government agency securities with maturities of less than two years from the balance sheet date 
all investments are classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost in the accompanying financial statements with the exception of one available for sale investment  which is stated at fair value based on the quoted market price of the security 
unrealized gains and losses on such securities are reported as other comprehensive income loss  which is a separate component of stockholders equity 
at december   the carrying value of our available for sale security approximated fair value  and accordingly there was no unrealized gain or loss 
we are required to maintain restricted cash or investments to collateralize borrowings under tanox s line of credit and its irrevocable letter of credit 
additionally  we have cash deposited with the district court in connection with the pending appeal of an unfavorable arbitration award see note 
as of december   tanox had restricted cash and investments of million 
at december   we held investments with a net carrying value of million and a fair market value of million 
at any point in time  amortized cost may be greater or less than fair market value 
if investments are sold prior to maturity  we could incur a realized gain or loss based on the fair market value of the investments at the date of sale 
additionally  we could incur future losses on investments if the investment issuer becomes impaired or the investment is down graded 
research and development research and development costs  including incidental patent costs  are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs include estimates for clinical trial costs  which are based on patient enrollment and clinical trial progress 
actual costs may differ from estimates 
contingent liabilities we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in the commitments and contingencies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have accrued our estimate of litigation related liabilities in consultation with outside counsel handling our cases 
the estimate is based on the facts and circumstances of these matters known to us at this time 
the actual liability may be more or less than the amount of our current estimates  depending on the outcome of these matters 
stock based compensation deferred stock based compensation and related amortization represents the difference between the exercise price of stock options granted to our consultants and the fair value of our common stock at the applicable date of grant 
stock based compensation is amortized as research and development expense or general and administrative expense  as appropriate  over the vesting period of the individual stock options for which it was recorded  generally four years 
the amount of stock based compensation expense to be recorded in future periods may decrease if unvested stock options for which deferred stock based compensation has been recorded are subsequently canceled or forfeited or may increase if additional stock options are granted to individuals other than employees or directors 
recent accounting developments in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on tanox s results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based accounting for employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
tanox is currently evaluating whether to adopt the fair value based method 
the additional disclosures required under sfas no 
are effective for fiscal year ending after december   and have been provided in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased to  in from  in revenues in represented licensing fees associated with non exclusive patent licenses 
revenues in were primarily grants 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was associated with staffing growth and increased spending in clinical manufacturing and clinical trials for the tnx and tnx programs 
this increase was partially offset by cost savings from closing down our tanox pharma bv formerly known as pangenetics bv research facility 
in addition  depreciation expense increased by  due to capital expenditures made in previous periods for research  clinical manufacturing equipment and facilities improvement 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase relates primarily to higher legal costs associated with increased litigation activities and higher personnel costs 
restructuring charge 
in june  the company recorded a million restructuring charge associated with the closure of the research operations of tanox pharma  bv the company has settled most of the restructuring liabilities except the severance dispute with the former managing director of tanox pharma  bv and legal cost accruals related to ongoing litigation with the former pangenetics shareholders 
as of december   the company estimated that  in restructuring liabilities still remain and is classified as an accrued liability on the balance sheet 
other income expense 
other income decreased to million in from million in this decrease was principally due to reduced interest income in resulting from lower interest rates and lower cash and investment balances  and a  decline in the fair value of an available for sale investment 
income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes in  due to the pre tax loss of million 
this pre tax loss generated a tax benefit  which was fully offset by an increase in tanox s valuation allowance 
net loss 
the net loss increased to million or per share in  as compared to million or per share in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased to  in from million in the million decrease in revenues in resulted primarily from million in milestone revenues earned in june under our collaborative agreements with novartis and genentech when the bla for xolair was submitted to the fda 
the collaborative agreements with novartis and genentech accounted for none of the revenues in and of total revenues in other revenues in both years consisted of grants  government subsidies and technology licensing revenue 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in in  we incurred higher salary and related costs from increased staffing  increased expenses related to process development and manufacturing feasibility studies  and an in process research and development charge of million related to the acquisition of tanox pharma bv the increase was partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses due to the closure of tanox pharma bv  a million charge in to acquire the right to non exclusive licenses to patents and patent applications owned by protein design labs  inc and a  charge in to acquire certain technologies from lxr biotechnology  inc general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the increase relates primarily to higher legal costs associated with increased litigation activity and higher infrastructure costs 
restructuring charge 
in june we implemented a plan to consolidate our research operations in houston  texas 
in connection with the plan  we closed our facility in amsterdam and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring charge primarily consisted of  for severance and related costs   of goodwill impairment   for the write down of assets  million for agreement terminations and  for other exit costs 
other income 
other income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was principally due to a decrease in interest income in resulting from lower interest rates 
income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes in  due to the pre tax loss of million 
this pre tax loss generated a tax benefit  which was fully offset by an increase in tanox s valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate in significantly differed from the us federal statutory rate 
the provision for income taxes was  due to income generated in the us and losses from foreign subsidiaries that were not tax deductible in the us  and did not offset the us tax provision 
in addition  we generated a tax benefit from non qualified stock option exercises in the benefit was reflected as a reduction to additional paid in capital in the accompanying financial statements 
net loss 
as a result of the above factors  the net loss for the year ended december  was million or per share on both a basic and fully diluted basis  compared with a net loss in of million or per share on both a basic and fully diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through sales of equity securities  collaboration and grant revenues  interest income and equipment financing agreements 
during the year ended december   we sold  shares of common stock at in an initial public offering and received net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments  of which million were classified as current assets 
at december   million of cash and investments was pledged against the company s outstanding borrowings under its line of credit and its irrevocable letter of credit or was deposited with the district court in connection with our appeal of an unfavorable arbitration ruling 
during the year ended december   we used proceeds from investment maturities and sales  interest income  proceeds from stock option exercises and proceeds from bank borrowings  together with cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   to fund operating activities  capital expenditures and the repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
the combination of the above items and the increase in short and long term investment securities resulted in a net decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments of million including the restricted amount of million for the year ended december  during  we sold two corporate securities with a total book value of million prior to their stated maturity for a net gain of  which is included in the interest income on the consolidated income statement 
the decision to sell these securities was based upon the decline in their credit rating  which no longer conformed to our investment policy 
in september  we entered into a million revolving line of credit note agreement with a bank 
under the terms of the agreement  tanox may secure advances up to the aggregate principal amount of million  the proceeds of which can be used to finance the company s working capital requirements  as well as the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
the outstanding principal balance is payable in full on september   and advances bear interest at the lesser of the prime rate or libor  the london interbank offered rate  plus 
accrued interest is payable on the last day of each month 
as of december   the company had borrowed million under the agreement 
from through  novartis advanced tanox million  pursuant to a loan agreement  to finance its pilot manufacturing facility 
tanox has pledged all of the assets of the pilot manufacturing facility as security for the loan 
the loan bears interest at the libor rate plus 
through december   novartis has agreed to forgive interest on the loan 
subject to modifications agreed to in principle concurrent with completion of the tripartite collaboration among tanox  novartis and genentech in july  the principal and future interest payments may be partially or totally forgiven by novartis based on the future use of the facility 
under the loan agreements  upon activation of the facility for production  tanox is required to make principal and interest payments on the loan in amounts equal to of net cash flow  if any  from the facility 
if the net cash flow payments during the ten years following the date the facility first became operational are not sufficient to repay the principal and accrued interest on the loan  novartis has agreed to forgive the remaining principal and accrued interest 
the facility was activated in and  until october  produced clinical trial materials for tnx accordingly  we have accrued interest of  on the loan for we expect to reactivate the pilot plant to produce clinical trial materials for our other products in on september   we purchased a  square foot office and warehouse building adjacent to our research and manufacturing facility for million 
we currently intend to renovate the building  at an estimated cost of approximately million  sometime in or into a research and administrative office facility at which point we will relocate our corporate office and members of our research staff to the facility 
on september   we purchased the  square foot research and pilot manufacturing facility in houston  texas that we had been leasing  together with approximately acres of adjacent land  for million 
the million purchase price was funded under the bank line of credit described above 
the draw is collateralized with cash and investments at the bank 
we intend to pursue permanent financing options  including a possible sale and lease back for both buildings 
additionally  during the year ended december   we invested approximately million in equipment and facility improvements  primarily to support the expansion of our research and product development activities 
tanox has future minimum lease obligations of  under non cancelable leases at december   of which approximately  will be paid in our current and anticipated development projects will require substantial additional capital to complete 
we anticipate that the amount of cash we need to fund operations  including research and development  manufacturing and other costs  and for capital expenditures  will grow in the future as our projects move from clinical development to commercialization 
we also expect that we will need to expand our clinical development  manufacturing capacity  facilities  business development and marketing activities to support the future development of our programs 
we expect that cash on hand and revenue from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next three to four years 
however  our future capital needs will depend on many factors  including the successful commercialization of xolair  receiving payments from our collaboration partners  progress in our research and development activities  commercialization activities  the costs and magnitude of product or technology acquisitions  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  establishing additional collaboration and licensing arrangements  and manufacturing scale up costs and marketing activities  if we undertake those activities 
consequently  we may need to raise substantial additional funds 
we do not have committed external sources of funding and we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to 
delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our programs  
obtain funds through arrangements with collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or 
license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
we are currently engaged in litigation relating to a fee dispute with the law firms that represented us in litigation with genentech relating to  among other things  the intellectual property rights surrounding the development of anti ige technology 
an arbitration panel issued an award entitling the attorneys to receive i approximately million including interest  ii payments ranging from to of the future milestone payments we would receive from genentech following product approval  and iii of the royalties that we would receive on all sales of anti ige products 
tanox sought a court order vacating this arbitration award  but a judgment was entered confirming the award 
we appealed the district court s decision to the court of appeals  th district of texas  and on august   the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court 
we intend to appeal this decision to the texas supreme court 
during the appeals process  we are required to post a bond or place amounts in escrow to secure payment of the award 
we posted a million supersedeas bond with the court to continue the appeals process and to secure payment of the award 
if tanox is ultimately required to pay all or part of the award to the attorneys  tanox could be required to pay up to million  plus accrued interest that would become due  and the award would effectively reduce future milestone payments from genentech by up to and reduce future royalties from the three party collaboration by 
accordingly  tanox s future revenues  result of operations  cash flow and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
in the normal course of business  we have established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
foreign currency exchange rates 
for the year ended december   our balance sheet reflects a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment of  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk because 
we invest in our foreign subsidiaries  
we incur a portion of our revenues and expenses in the local currencies of the countries where we do business  and 
we finance part of the cost of our subsidiaries operations through dollar denominated inter company loans and equity investments that are recorded on their books in the respective local currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates have not had a material impact on our revenues or costs and expenses  but have affected the value of our equity investments and intercompany loans 
as a result of our international operations and our current financing approach  fluctuations in exchange rates of the local currencies versus the us dollar impact our operating results 
we are primarily exposed to gains and losses with respect to euros  dutch guilders and taiwan dollars because our subsidiaries conduct business or have conducted business in these currencies 
to date  we have not implemented a program to hedge our foreign currency risk  but we may do so in the future 
interest rate risk 
cash  cash equivalents and investments were approximately million including the restricted cash and investments of million at december  these assets were primarily invested in investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper with maturities of less than two years  which we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity 
we do not invest in derivative securities 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless we sell the asset 
in addition  our bank line of credit and our loan from novartis are based on a premium over libor 
as such  if general interest rates increase  our interest costs will increase
