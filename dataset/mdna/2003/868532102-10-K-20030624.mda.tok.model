item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this discussion includes forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are not historical facts  and are based on current expectations  estimates  and projections about our industry  our beliefs  our assumptions  and our goals and objectives 
words such as anticipates  expects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  and estimates  and variations of these words and similar expressions  are intended to identify forward looking statements 
examples of the kinds of forward looking statements in this report include statements regarding the following we expect to undertake research and development of more than thirty new product projects during fiscal  our expectation that our wafer fabrication facility fab will fulfill our wafer manufacturing capacity needs  our belief that our current backlog will be shipped in fiscal  our belief that our patents may have value and may be useful for cross licensing  our belief that our position as a leading supplier in our targeted markets can only be maintained through continuous investments in r d  our anticipation that we will not pay dividends in the near term  our hope that the economy will recover in the coming quarters and that as a result the business of our customers will increase leading to increased revenue for us as well  our belief that our continued growth depends in part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees   that available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash and working capital requirements through the end of fiscal  that we expect to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions in fiscal year  and that the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
these statements are only predictions  are not guarantees  of future performance  and are subject to risks  uncertainties  and other factors  some of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict  and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include those described in item factors which may affect operating results and elsewhere in this report  as well as the risks that our patents may not have material value and that there may not be a market to cross license them  that there may be alternative ways for us to maintain our competitive position than through investments in r d  that these alternatives may cost us less money or be more effective than investments in r d  that our investments in r d may not result in new products  and that even if our investments in r d result in new products  these products may not enable us to maintain our competitive position  that we will not obtain continued growth despite hiring highly skilled employees  that we will not generate enough cash from operations to meet our cash and working capital requirements through the end of fiscal  that we need to spend more on capital acquisitions than anticipated  or that we overestimate or underestimate our need for capital acquisition  and that changes in short term interest rates are significant enough to effect our investment portfolio 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
overview supertex designs  develops  manufactures  and markets high voltage analog and mixed signal integrated circuits utilizing state of the art high voltage dmos  hvcmos and hvbicmos analog and mixed signal technologies 
we supply standard and custom interface products primarily for the use in the telecommunications  imaging  and medical electronics markets 
we also provide wafer foundry services for the manufacture of integrated circuits for customers using customer owned designs and mask toolings 
factors which may affect operating results semiconductor companies as a group are subject to many similar risks 
these include the risks that the demand for semiconductors decreases as the industry has historically been very cyclical  there are shortages of raw materials and or fab capacity  or there are changes in underlying circuit or process technology or fab technology 
other factors that could affect our future results include whether we can generate new bookings from both new and current products  general economic conditions  both in the united states and foreign markets  and economic conditions specific to the semiconductor industry  risks associated with customer concentration  our ability to introduce new products  to enhance existing products  and to meet the continually changing requirements of our customers  our ability to maintain and enhance relationships with our assembly and test subcontractors and independent distributors and sales representatives  and whether we can manufacture efficiently and control costs 
in addition  we are subject to the below described risks  which are specific to us and our business we have focused our product offerings primarily on niche markets which leverage our capabilities and in which we believe we have dominance 
we attempt to choose markets which are sizable enough to be worth pursuing but which are not large enough to attract fierce competition 
these markets could grow enough to attract increased competition or else competitors could enter due to happenstance or downturns elsewhere 
in addition  these niches might be more susceptible to shrinkage than more diverse markets  due to their concentration on a few product offerings 
we are dependent upon one fab which we own and operate 
we would be susceptible were this fab to be unable to meet our needs  for example  were this fab to become obsolete due to process technology changes  or to be damaged  for example by fire or earthquake 
we could encounter difficulties in operating our fab  such as contaminants in the air or defects in equipment  which could affect yields and production 
we have several competitors which are substantially larger and could bring to bear substantially more resources in our niche markets 
we have been able to maintain profitable margins in part because of our dominance of most of our niche markets 
increased competition could cause our margins to decrease 
henry pao  a director of and the president and ceo of the company  along with mr 
pao s father and brother  collectively own greater than of our outstanding stock 
they have no agreement among themselves to act together with respect to the company or their stockholdings 
however  were they to act in concert  they would be our largest beneficial shareholder and would have an ability to elect one or more directors  to direct management  and to delay or prevent a change in control 
we sell a substantial amount of our products internationally 
we also package and test most of our products abroad 
problems with foreign economies  political turmoil  wars  changes in the exchange rate  or epidemics  such as sars could adversely affect our foreign sales or foreign product assembly 
our operations may be interrupted and our business would be harmed in the event of an earthquake  terrorist act  and other disaster 
our principal executive offices  our fab facilities  and major suppliers are located in areas that have been subject to severe earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake  we and or our major suppliers may be temporarily unable to continue operations and may suffer significant property damage 
any such interruption in our ability or that of our major suppliers to continue operations at our facilities could delay the development and shipment of our products 
like other us companies  our business and operating results are subject to uncertainties arising out of the recent terrorist attacks on the united states  including the potential worsening or extension of the current global economic slowdown  the economic consequences of current and potential military actions or additional terrorist activities and associated political instability  and the impact of heightened security concerns on domestic and international travel and commerce 
such uncertainties could also lead to delays or cancellations of customer orders  a general decrease in corporate spending or our inability to effectively market and sell our products 
any of these results could substantially harm our business and results of operations  causing a decrease in our revenues 
we depended upon one customer  microtek  for approximately of our fiscal year sales 
microtek is our primary distributor in japan with at least twenty end user customers 
most of our customers can typically cancel or reschedule orders without penalty so decreased demand for our products could translate into rapid decreases in sales volume 
we are very dependent upon continued innovation of our engineers 
the competition for engineers with relevant experience is extremely intense in the silicon valley  where most of our engineers are located 
we must compete in terms of salary  benefits  and working conditions with many start ups which can offer more equity 
we established an ic design center in hong kong in fiscal where competition for qualified engineer is not as intense as that in silicon valley 
however  a majority of our product innovation activities remains in our sunnyvale and san jose offices 
we operate a fab in san jose  california at which we use various chemicals and solvents which are regulated by various environmental agencies 
we cooperate and work with these agencies to comply with these regulations 
should we nonetheless inadvertently contaminate the soil or ground water  or should the previous operator of the fab have done so  we may be responsible for significant costs to remediate the situation 
we are dependent upon the continued service of several of our key management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our engineers  executive officers and other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for  or to attract  retain and motivate these individuals would be harmful to our business 
we do not have long term employment contracts with our employees 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and selected consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this form k 
the following table sets forth items from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated fiscal years ended march  net sales costs of sales research and development selling  general and administrative income from operations other income interest income other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our revenues  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  asset impairments  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue from direct product sales to end user customers upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is upon shipment of the product provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for sales to original equipment manufacturers oems  we use either a binding purchase order or signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a distributor agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
sales to our distributors are made primarily under arrangements allowing limited rights of return  limited price protection and the right of stock rotation on merchandise unsold by the distributors 
because of the uncertainty associated with pricing concessions and possible returns  we defer the recognition of such sales and the related costs of sales until our distributors have sold the merchandise to their end user customers 
our deferred revenue also includes customer advances under licensing agreements 
we recognize deferred license revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
sales returns and other allowances we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical experience  analysis of outstanding return material authorization rma and allowance authorization aa data and any other form of notification we receive of pending returns 
we continuously monitor and track product returns and in circumstances where we are aware of specific customer return or allowance which is over and above normal historical sales returns  we record a specific allowance against the amounts due to reduce our net receivable for such customer 
while our sales returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product failure rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  a minimum allowance is established for all customers based on a percentage applied to outstanding accounts receivable 
this percentage is based on our historical collection and write off experience 
second  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that a specific customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc 
to us 
in these cases  significant management judgments and estimates must be made  based on the best available facts and circumstances 
we record a specific allowance for that customer against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
these specific reserves are re evaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market value and include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature and subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand over nine months 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are not valued 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of our standard manufacturing cost or market value 
while the company has programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and considers technological obsolescence when estimating amounts required to reduce recorded amounts to market values  it is reasonably possible that such estimates could change in the near term 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
accounting for investments and consolidation although the carrying value of our investments in privately held companies is nil at march   we may make investments in privately held companies in the future 
investments in privately held companies that are not publicly traded have no established market 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of these investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies 
this policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
if we believe that the carrying value of an investment is in excess of its fair value  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of income 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss in the current period to the extent of the decline below the carrying value of the investment 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
in addition  adverse operating results of underlying long term investments could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we routinely consider whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment charge to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value 
the fair value of the asset then becomes the asset s new carrying value  which we depreciate or amortize over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset where appropriate 
we may incur impairment losses in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets annually 
we have determined that no valuation allowance is required because  although realization is not assured  the company has sufficient taxable income in carryback years to absorb items deductible in the future for federal tax purposes and anticipates that its estimated future taxable income will allow the deferred tax asset for state tax purposes to be fully realized in future years 
the amount of the deferred tax asset that is realizable could be reduced in the near term if actual results differ significantly from estimates of future taxable income 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page of this annual report on form k which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recent developments during fiscal  we continued to experience a decreased demand for our products  particularly when compared with the significantly higher levels of demand we experienced during fiscal and our sales continued to be affected by the general slowdown in the economy and in particular the lack of recovery and continued business deceleration at our telecommunications equipment customers 
we are hopeful that as the expected improvements in the economy continue over the coming quarters  the business of our customers would increase leading to increased revenue for us as well  although we do not expect to achieve the same level of demand experienced in fiscal and during the year  we generated positive cash flow 
we have been successful in controlling costs and have remained profitable even though sales have dropped significantly and our fab has been running at below capacity 
results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal net sales we had net sales of  in fiscal  a decrease of from the previous fiscal year net sales of  overall semiconductor industry conditions were very weak during fiscal year  as were conditions in all of the markets that we serve  except the imaging market in which we increased our market share 
in fiscal  sales of our telecommunications products continued to be adversely affected by the telecommunications industry s lackluster infrastructure spending which reduced demand for our customers products 
this was offset in part by increased revenues for our products in the imaging market 
as percentage of total sales for the year ended march   sales to the medical market accounted for of total sales in fiscal compared to in the previous year 
the telecommunications market represented and of total sales for the fiscal year and  respectively 
sales to the imaging market accounted for of total sales for fiscal compared to in fiscal the sales increase was primarily due to the sales increase in the backlighting inverter ics for cellular phone applications 
sales to all other markets represented in fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal year on a dollar basis  sales of our medical electronics products decreased to  from  sales of our telecommunications products decreased to  from  and sales of our imaging products increased to  from in fiscal  we derived approximately of our net sales from customers outside the united states  primarily in asia and europe  compared to in fiscal dollar sales to international customers also increased approximately from  to  additional discussion regarding our revenues based on geographic area can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of net sales for fiscal was approximately compared to for fiscal year the drop in margin was the result of a slightly less favorable product sales mix  the charge for the write down of inventory  and continued low plant capacity utilization  partially offset by continued cost control 
research and development research and development r d expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the net decrease of  in r d expense for the current year was primarily attributed to a reduction in prototype processing costs of  as several new products were transferred to production status  reduction in software expenses of  reduction in mask tooling expenses of  and reduction in rent expenses of  offset by an increase in payroll and benefit expenses of  due to additional headcount 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively

in addition  sg a expenses for the fiscal year were partially offset by benefits from the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable of  as compared with sg a expenses for fiscal which were partially offset by benefits from the collection of previously reserved accounts receivable of approximately  sg a expenses were favorably impacted by the reversal of a provision for legal expenses in fiscal of  following the favorable settlement of a claim initiated by a customer in fiscal related to a product returned 
interest income interest income  which consists primarily of interest income from our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decline in interest income in fiscal was mostly due to lower yields on cash deposit accounts as compared to the prior year

we were able to retain the gross margin level by lowering manufacturing expenditures through rigorous cost reduction measures 
research and development research and development r d expenses  which include payroll and benefits  processing costs and process transfer costs  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
dollar expenditures for research and development were  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in r d expense for this year was attributed to the increase in payroll and benefit expenses due to additional headcount of  and the increase in mask tooling expenses for the new products of  during the year  we continued to increase our staff and equip our hong kong design center and the telecom design group in san jose  california 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses  which include commissions  payroll and benefits  were and of net sales in fiscal and  respectively

provision for income taxes income taxes for fiscal and were at of income before provision for income taxes 
financial condition overview total assets grew to  at the end of fiscal  up from  at the end of fiscal the increase was due primarily to profit generated from operations during the year as well as from profit from interest and other income and cash proceeds from exercise of options under our stock option and purchase plans 
as of march   the company s working capital was  which was a  increase over march  the increase in working capital was mostly the result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in accounts payable offset in part by a reduction in net book value of property  plant and equipment  reduction in net inventory and an increase in income taxes payable 
liquidity and capital resources on march   the company had  in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  compared with  on march   and  on march  cash and cash equivalents increased  during fiscal from  at march  to  at march  the increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal is due to cash flows from operating activities of  cash flows from investing activities of  and cash flows from financing activities of  our primary source of funds for fiscal  and has been the net cash generated from operating activities of   and  respectively 
net operating cash flows in fiscal were impacted by the following net income of  non cash charges for depreciation of  non cash loss of  from an impairment of a long term investment an investment of  previously invested in long term investments and cash equivalents transferred into short term investments classified as trading securities a gain on the sale of a long term investment of  an increase in net trade accounts receivable of  including a non cash reduction of  for the provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns and a net increase in gross accounts receivable of a decrease in net inventory of  consisting of a non cash charge for the provision for excess and obsolescence of  and a decrease due to normal operating activities of  a decrease in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses of  comprised primarily of a decrease in trade accounts payable of  which resulted from a decrease in operating expenses and equipment purchases an increase in income taxes payable of  which is net of a tax benefit from stock option exercises of  that is recognized in shareholders equity net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was  which consisted of  proceeds from the sale of long term investment offset by purchases of equipment of  primarily for upgrading our wafer fabrication facility 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was  which consisted of proceeds from exercises of stock options and espp of  partially offset by repurchases of our common stock in the amount of  the company anticipates that the available funds and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to meet cash and working capital requirements through the end of fiscal the company expects to spend approximately  for capital acquisitions during fiscal  which is much less than prior years because most of the upgrades to our fab and our test operations have been completed  and we do not plan to add any capacity in the near future 
the company has commitments for non cancelable operating leases 
future minimum lease payments and sublease income under all non cancelable operating leases at march  are as follows in thousands fiscal years ending march operating lease sublease income thereafter we have agreed to defend certain customers  distributors  suppliers  and subcontractors against certain claims which third parties may assert that our products allegedly infringe certain of their intellectual property rights  including patents  trademarks  trade secrets  or copyrights 
we have also agreed to pay certain amounts of any resulting damage awards and we have the option to replace any infringing product with non infringing product 
the terms of these indemnification obligations are generally perpetual from the effective date of the agreement 
in certain cases  there are limits on and exceptions to our potential liability for indemnification relating to intellectual property infringement claims 
we cannot estimate the amount of potential future payments  if any  that we might be required to make as a result of these agreements 
to date  we have not paid any damage award or been required to defend any claim related to our indemnification obligations  and accordingly  we have not accrued any amounts for our indemnification obligations 
however  there can be no assurances that we will not have any financial exposure under those indemnification obligations 
certain relationships and related transactions the company leased a portion of a building  consisting of approximately  sq 
ft at bordeaux drive  sunnyvale  california under an operating lease from fortuna realty co  a corporation owned by a former supertex director  yunni pao 
the lease will expire on april   which coincides with our sublease agreement with reaction technology  our epitaxial deposition service provider at essentially the same cost 
previously we leased the entire building  consisting of approximately  sq 
ft 
the total rental expenses paid to fortuna realty co 
were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we believe that the lease with fortuna realty co 
was and is at prevailing market rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks due primarily to changes in interest rates 
the company does not use derivatives to alter the interest characteristics of its investment securities 
the company has no holdings of derivative or commodity instruments  and its holdings are for purposes other than trading purposes 
the fair value of the company s investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates since the investment maturities are short and the interest rates are primarily fixed
