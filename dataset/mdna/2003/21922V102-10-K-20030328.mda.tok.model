market risk disclosure the company is subject to changes in the fair market value of its fixed rate secured debt amounting to million at december  if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were basis points higher at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would decrease by million to million 
if market interest rates for fixed rate debt were basis points lower at december   the fair value of fixed rate debt would have increased from million to million 
the company has market risk exposure to short term interest rates from variable rate borrowings under its existing unsecured line of credit and variable rate secured debt 
the existing unsecured line of credit bears interest at libor plus basis points 
the company may utilize variable rate debt up to specified limits to total market capitalization 
the company has analyzed its interest rate risk exposure 
if market interest rates for these types of credit facilities average basis points more in than they did in  and the company s line of credit was at the maximum of million  and the variable rate secured debt remained at million  the company s interest expense would increase  and net income would decrease by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s borrowing cost 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that inflation had any significant impact on its operations in future inflation  if any  would likely cause increased property operating expenses  but the company believes that increases in property operating expenses would be more than offset by increases in rental income 
continued inflation may also cause capital appreciation of the company s apartment communities over time  as rental rates and replacement costs increase
