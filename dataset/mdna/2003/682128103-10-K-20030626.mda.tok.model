overview we design  develop and market high performance  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main product  an image sensing device called the camerachip  is used to capture an image in a number of consumer and commercial mass market applications 
our camerachips are designed to use the cmos fabrication process 
we have designed our camerachip as a single chip solution that integrates several distinct functions including image capture  image processing  color processing and the conversion and output of a fully processed image or video stream 
our highly integrated cmos camerachips help enable mass market camera device manufacturers to build camera applications that generally have high image quality and resolution  are low cost and small in size and consume low amounts of power 
our camerachips are currently used in a number of consumer applications including digital still and video cameras  cell phones  personal digital assistants  personal computers and toys and games such as interactive video games 
our camerachips are sold to customers who incorporate them in either digital or analog mass market applications 
some examples of digital mass market applications that currently incorporate our camerachips are digital still cameras  cell phone cameras and personal computer camera applications 
some examples of analog applications that currently incorporate our camerachips are security and surveillance cameras and toy cameras 
we sell our products worldwide by a direct sales force to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  which include branded customers and contract manufacturers  and value added resellers  or vars  and indirectly through distributors 
we outsource the wafer fabrication  color filter application and packaging of our camerachip products 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development and marketing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
we have designed and developed a complete pc based system for the testing of our camerachips 
this system has automatic handling capability  an image source  a lighting and lens system and automatic output sorting capability 
we believe that this proprietary testing process helps us to reduce our testing costs  maintain consistent product quality  and identify areas for continued improvement in product quality 
prior to the end of calendar  we intend to consolidate our testing operations at our chinese subsidiary 
as part of this consolidation  we will move our automated image testing equipment from the united states to china 
in addition  over the next months  we anticipate expanding the scope of our operations at our chinese facility to include other processes associated with the manufacture of our products  such as color filter 
table of contents applications and sensor packaging 
we also expect to expand our testing capabilities with additional automated testing equipment  which also will be located in china 
we intend to maintain our position as a leader in cmos sensor technology by continuing to develop our core technology through our in house research and development efforts 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k 
our estimates are guided by observing the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate our revenue by selling our products to oems  vars and distributors 
we recognize revenue on sales to oems and vars upon the shipment of our products to our customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is considered probable  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
for shipments to distributors under agreements allowing for return or credits  revenue is deferred until the distributor resells the product 
we provide for future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized 
see allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve below for additional information regarding sales return reserves 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue at the time until collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales return reserve credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms require payment upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an on going basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging and provide reserves for doubtful accounts and estimated sales returns 
customer credit worthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and sales returns and may require additional provisions  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable and our sales return reserve represented approximately of total accounts receivable 

table of contents inventory write off and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand for a period of time  generally six months 
because of obsolescence  we will generally provide a full reserve for the costs of our inventories in excess of our relevant forecast for the applicable period 
due to a significant supply imbalance in the pc camera market in the third quarter of fiscal  we experienced the cancellation of a significant portion of our backlog 
our revenues dropped from million for the second quarter of fiscal to million for the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we revised our estimates of product demand and recorded a charge of million for excess inventories 
in fiscal and we sold certain of the inventories for which we had recorded the provision 
even though we sold the inventories at a price that was less than our original cost  because the costs were fully reserved  the effect of such sales was to improve our gross margins 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding six months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for the future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will provide a reserve  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
when such an event occurs  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
to date  no impairment loss has been recognized 
we assess the impairment in value to our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
accounting for income taxes as of april   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million  offsetting net deferred tax assets except to the extent that deferred tax assets could be carried back 
for each of fiscal and fiscal  there was no income tax provision because we incurred operating losses 
for fiscal  the income tax provision reflected an effective tax rate of 
this rate was less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because of the reversal of the fiscal valuation allowance  certain tax credits and other factors 
going forward  a number of factors will affect our tax rate  and the combined effect of these factors will be an increase in our effective rate 
a key factor that will cause the rate to increase is that the financial statement benefit of reversing the valuation allowance has already been recognized 
we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal but be less than the combined federal 
table of contents and state statutory rates 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally contingent upon our foreign affiliates generating income 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings 
our success and future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot assure you that any patent will be issued as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
see legal proceedings for a description of the counterclaim ic media has brought against us with respect to one of our foreign patents 
it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
these disputes may result in costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for free 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringed technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail

table of contents revenues we derive revenues from the sale of our camerachip products for use in a wide variety of consumer and commercial mass market applications including digital still cameras  cell phones  video game consoles and security and surveillance cameras 
revenues for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
revenues from sales of camerachips for digital as compared to analog applications 
our camerachips are sold to customers who incorporate them into either digital or analog applications 
examples of digital applications that incorporate our camerachips are digital still cameras  cellular phone cameras and personal computer camera applications 
examples of analog applications that incorporate our camerachips are security and surveillance cameras and toy cameras 
we sell a large portion of our products through vars and distributors and often we do not know the identity of the manufacturer who is embedding our camerachips into their products 
as a result of our sales to vars and distributors and because our camerachips can be used in a wide variety of digital or analog products  we cannot accurately confirm the distribution of our revenues amongst specific product categories 
however  we are able to confirm the distribution of our revenues by digital and analog product categories and they are as follows fiscal year ended april  in thousands digital image sensors analog image sensors total comparison of fiscal and fiscal digital revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for digital applications increased from fiscal to fiscal and represented of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal this increase in revenue from sales of camerachips for digital image sensor applications was due primarily to increased unit sales 
we believe this increase resulted from heightened consumer demand for digital still camera and cell phone products 
we expect revenue from sales of camerachips for digital applications for use in add on cell phone devices to decline as a result of the market transition to embedded cell phone camera devices 
we expect our revenue from sales of our camerachips in asia for digital applications will increase in fiscal primarily as a result of increased sales of cmos image sensors in the digital still camera markets  cell phones with embedded cameras and video games incorporating camera devices  although we do not expect to see these increases in the first portion of fiscal analog revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for analog applications decreased from fiscal to fiscal and represented of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal we believe this decrease in sales of camerachips for analog image sensor applications was due primarily to decreased demand for our camerachips for use in security surveillance cameras 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal digital revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for digital applications decreased from fiscal to fiscal and represented of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal we believe this decrease in sales of camerachips for digital image sensor applications was due primarily to decreased demand for pc cameras 

table of contents analog revenues 
revenues from sales of camerachips for analog applications increased from fiscal to fiscal and represented of our revenues in fiscal and in fiscal we believe this increase in sales of camerachips for analog image sensor applications was due primarily to increased consumer demand for security surveillance cameras 
revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors we sell our camerachips either directly to oems and vars or through distributors 
the following table illustrates the percentage of revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  oems and vars distributors total oems and vars 
in fiscal  our only oem or var customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was primax electronics products huizhou  or primax  based in china  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in such fiscal year 
primax is a supplier to motorola  inc in fiscal  our only oem or var customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was x  a security and surveillance camera manufacturer  which accounted for approximately of revenues in such fiscal year 
in fiscal  our only oem or var customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was creative technology  a pc camera manufacturer  which accounted for approximately of revenues in such fiscal year 
we expect the percentage of revenue of sales to oems and vars to decrease as compared to distributors in fiscal due to increased demand from digital still camera manufacturers in asia that generally purchase camerachips from our distributors 
revenues from distributors 
in fiscal  our only distributor customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was world peace industrial co 
ltd  or world peace  headquartered in taiwan  which accounted for approximately of revenues in such fiscal year 
this fiscal revenue figure for sales to world peace includes purchases by world peace s subsidiary  gaintune based in hong kong 
during fiscal and  world peace accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our revenues 
for fiscal and  no other distributor customer accounted for or more of our revenues 
revenues from domestic sales as compared to foreign sales the following table illustrates the percentage of revenues from sales of our camerachip products to domestic customers as compared to foreign customers in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  domestic sales foreign sales total all of our foreign sales are attributable to sales made to oems  vars and distributors in asia 
over time  our sales to asia pacific customers have increased primarily as a result of the continuing trend of outsourcing production to asian manufacturers and facilities 
because of the preponderance of asia pacific manufacturers and the fact that virtually all products incorporating our camerachips are sold globally  we believe that such figures do not accurately reflect geographic distribution of sales of our products into end user markets 

table of contents gross profit comparison of fiscal and fiscal gross margin for fiscal and was and of revenues  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to the benefit in fiscal from the sale of a relatively larger amount of previously written off inventory  and was also due to increased sales of our camerachips in module based products in fiscal as compared to fiscal which carry a lower gross profit margin than our sensor arrays sold in chip form 
gross profit for fiscal included a gross profit of approximately million from the sale of inventory that we had written off in the quarter ended january  for fiscal  approximately million of the margin was attributable to gross profit from the sale of previously written off inventory 
excluding the revenues and gross profit from the sale of the written off inventory  the gross margin would have been approximately of revenues for fiscal as compared to of revenues in fiscal the decrease in gross margin on an adjusted basis for fiscal was due to our increased sales of our camerachips in module based products which carry a lower gross profit margin than our sensor arrays sold in chip form 
the module based product is sold with respect to cell phone applications 
excluding the impact of any sales of previously written off inventory  we expect our gross margin in fiscal to not appreciably increase or decrease as compared to fiscal the following table summarizes the effect of sales of previously written off inventory on our gross profits in fiscal and year ended april  in thousands sales of all products sales excluding products for which the costs were previously written off gross profit gross profit excluding the effect of sales of products for which the costs were previously written off gross margin gross margin excluding the effect of sales of products for which the costs were previously written off comparison of fiscal and fiscal gross margin for fiscal and was and of revenues  respectively 
gross margin for fiscal year included an approximately million one time benefit from the sale of inventory that was previously written off in fiscal during fiscal  we recognized an million charge for excess inventory 
excluding the benefit of previously written off inventory  the adjusted gross margin for fiscal was of revenues as compared to adjusted gross margin of in fiscal the increase in gross margin on an adjusted basis for fiscal was due to favorable changes in product mix and yield improvements on certain products 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses and costs for purchased materials  designs and tooling  depreciation of computers and workstations  and amortization of computer aided design software  all of which may fluctuate significantly from period to period as a result of our product development cycles 
research and development expenses for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses for fiscal  and represented  and  respectively 

table of contents comparison of fiscal and fiscal research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally as a result of salary and payroll expenses associated with additional personnel and new product development to improve our product line and support new product introductions 
examples of new product development expenses include tape out and prototype runs with our wafer manufacturers 
research and development personnel expenses increased during fiscal by approximately million as a result of the increase in research and development personnel and by approximately million as a result of foundry cost expenses associated with new product introductions 
research and development expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues during this period as a result of the increase in our revenues in fiscal we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars  but not as a percentage of revenues  in fiscal as we develop our next generation of camerachip products and as we continue to grow our business  including our research and development team 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally as a result of salary and payroll expenses associated with additional personnel and new product development to improve our product line and support new product introductions 
research and development personnel expenses increased during fiscal by approximately million as a result of the increase in research and development personnel and by approximately million as a result of foundry cost expenses associated with new product introductions 
research and development expenses increased as a percentage of revenues during this period as a result of our research and development expenses outpacing revenue growth in such period 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses  commissions paid to distributors and manufacturers representatives  and insurance and legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the expenses associated with the startup of our chinese subsidiary 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal  and represented  and  respectively 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the decrease on an absolute dollar basis  in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million for fiscal from fiscal was primarily a result of a million decrease in legal fees associated with patent litigation which was partially offset by an million increase in sales commissions  an million increase associated with sales expenses in asia and an increase of million in salaries and payroll expenses associated with an increase in personnel in sales and administration 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenues for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the lower cost and the proportionately greater increase in revenues 
we expect that our future selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to grow our business 
in particular  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  but not increase as a percentage of revenues  as we relocate most of our testing equipment from california to china and as we continue to build out our chinese testing and manufacturing facility 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million for fiscal from fiscal was primarily a result of an increase of million in litigation expenses associated with patent 
table of contents litigation  an increase of million in salaries and payroll expenses associated with additional sales and administrative personnel and an increase of million associated with sales activity in asia 
interest income  net our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in interest bearing accounts consisting primarily of money market accounts and high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately twelve months or less from the date of purchase 
interest income  net for fiscal  and  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
interest income  net  decreased for fiscal as compared to fiscal and for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to a decline in interest rates over such periods 
provision for income taxes we generated approximately million in income before income taxes for fiscal we recorded a provision for income taxes for fiscal of approximately million 
we generated losses before income taxes for fiscal and and therefore had no provision for income taxes in those years 
we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal will increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal but be less than the combined federal and state rate 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally contingent upon our foreign affiliates generating income 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of liquidity at april  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
our working capital increased by approximately million to million as of april  from million as of april  the million increase in inventories is primarily attributable to the need to have more inventories to support a higher level of sales 
inventory turns  calculated based on the fiscal quarters ended april  and  decreased from as of april  to as of april  the million increase in accounts receivable reflects the higher level of sales  offset in part by an improvement in days sales outstanding from days as of april  to days as of april  accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased by million and million  respectively  to support the increased level of operations 
the million increase in deferred margin is due to the higher level of shipments to distributors  for which revenue is deferred until the distributors sell the products 
for fiscal  our cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal  primarily due to a net income of million  a million increase in deferred margin and other liabilities  and a million increase in accounts payable  which were partially offset by a million increase in inventories to support future sales  and million increase in accounts receivable consistent with the increase in current quarter revenues  and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
for fiscal  our cash used in investing activities increased to approximately million from a use of million for the similar prior year period  due to million in net purchases of short term investment and a million in purchases of property  plant and equipment and a million investment in one of our packaging service providers  a private taiwanese company 
for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities increased to approximately million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options and from employee purchases through the employee stock purchase plan which totaled million during fiscal as compared to million for fiscal proceeds from the issuance and sale of common stock for fiscal were partially offset by million in refunded deposits from third parties for general business purposes 
for fiscal  such deposits contributed million to cash flows from financing activities

we established this subsidiary as part of our efforts to reduce the costs associated with the testing of our camerachips 
prior to the end of calendar  we intend to consolidate our testing operations in china 
in addition  over the next months we anticipate expanding the scope of our operations at our chinese facility to include other processes associated with the manufacture of our products  such as color filter application and sensor packaging 
we expect to fund the capital commitment to our chinese subsidiary through a combination of funds invested from our available working capital or by investments from third parties 
third party financing could include debt financing from banking institutions or an equity financing transaction 
third party financing may not be available to us when and as required or on terms that are favorable to our stockholders and us 
in the event we are unable to obtain financing from third parties  the issuance of our equity securities  including securities convertible into our equity securities  would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of our business 
issuance of debt securities could also impair our financial condition and interest payments could have an adverse effect on our results of operation 
on june   the company filed a registration statement on form s to register up to  shares of its common stock to be sold in an underwritten public offering 
the company is in the process of completing the final form s and currently has plans to issue such shares to the public 
the final price per share is not known nor is it known whether or not the company will actually issue such shares 
we currently expect our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash that we anticipate to be generated from business operations  to be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable working capital requirements 
our ability to generate cash from operations is subject to substantial risks described above under the caption risk factors 
we encourage you to review these risks carefully 
factors affecting future results this annual report on form k  including this management s discussion and analysis  contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business  financial condition or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results  including those set forth below 
risks related to our business we face intense competition in our markets from more established ccd and cmos image sensor manufacturers  and if we are unable to compete successfully we may not be able to maintain or grow our business 

table of contents the image sensor market is intensely competitive and we expect competition in this industry to continue to increase 
this competition has resulted in rapid technological change  evolving standards  reductions in product sales prices and rapid product obsolescence 
if we are unable to successfully meet these competitive challenges  we may be unable to maintain and grow our business 
any failure to compete successfully would also cause revenues to decline  impair our financial condition and reduce our profitability 
our camerachips face competition from a number of sources  including companies that sell ccd image sensors  as well as other companies that sell cmos image sensors 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases  more established strategic and financial relationships and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
our competitors include ccd image sensor manufacturers such as fuji  matsushita  nec  sharp  sony  sanyo and toshiba  as well as established cmos image sensor manufacturers such as agilent  ess  fujitsu  hynix  micron  mitsubishi electronic  motorola  national semiconductor  samsung  sharp  sony  stmicroelectronics and toshiba 
in addition  we compete with a large number of smaller cmos manufacturers including foveon  ic media corporation  pixart and zoran 
some of our customers may also be developers of image sensors 
samsung  for example  is a customer who uses our cmos products in certain of its products  but also independently manufactures cmos image sensors 
samsung is also a third party service provider that has fabricated  and may in the future fabricate  our interface chips or other products 
a customer that develops its own image sensors may reduce or cease purchases from us  and this could materially and adversely affect our ability to sustain and grow our business and could impair our financial results 
in addition  our competitors may acquire or enter into strategic or commercial agreements or arrangements with foundries or providers of color filter processing  assembly or packaging services 
these strategic arrangements between our competitors and third party service providers could involve preferential or exclusivity arrangements for our competitors 
as a result  these strategic alliances could impair our ability to secure sufficient capacity from foundries and service providers to meet our demand for wafer manufacturing  color filter processing  assembly or packaging services  adversely affecting our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
in addition  competitors may enter into exclusive relationships with distributors  which could reduce available distribution channels for our products and impair our ability to sell our products and grow our business 
declines in our average sales prices may result in a decline in our gross margin 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience pressure to reduce the sales prices of our products and have experienced declines in our average sales prices as a result 
we expect that the average sales prices for many of our products will continue to decline over time  in particular for those products focused on the digital still camera and cell phone markets 
declines in our average sales prices could result in reduced revenues or a decline in our gross margin  and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and impair our financial condition 
if we are unable to achieve cost reductions through manufacturing cost efficiencies and technological advances  or are unable to timely introduce new products that incorporate more advanced technology and include more advanced features that can be sold at higher average sales prices  our financial results will be adversely affected 
historically  our revenues have been dependent upon a few key customers  the loss of one or more of which could significantly reduce our revenues 
historically  a relatively small number of original equipment manufacturers  or oems  value added resellers  or vars  and distributors have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
any material delay  cancellation or reduction of purchase orders from one of our major customers or distributors could result in our failure to achieve anticipated revenue for the period 
if we are unable to retain one or more of our largest oem  
table of contents distributor or var customers  or if we are unable to maintain our current level of revenues from one or more of these significant customers  our business and results of operation would be impaired and our stock price could decrease  potentially significantly 
in fiscal  our only oem or var customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was primax electronics products huizhou based in china  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in such fiscal year 
in fiscal  our only distributor customer that accounted for more than of our revenues was world peace industrial co 
headquartered in taiwan  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in such fiscal year 
our business  financial condition and results of operations will continue to depend significantly on our ability to retain our current key customers and attract new customers  as well as on the financial condition and success of our oems  vars and distributors 
we depend on the increased acceptance of cmos technology for mass market image sensor applications  and any delay in the acceptance of this technology could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and increase our revenues 
our business strategy depends in large part on the continued growth of various markets into which we sell our camerachips  including the markets for digital still and video cameras  cell phones  personal digital assistants  personal computers  toys and games  including interactive video games  and commercial and home security and surveillance applications 
our ability to sustain and grow our business also depends on the emergence of new markets for our products such as cameras for automotive applications  personal identification systems and medical imaging devices 
if these current and new markets do not grow and develop as anticipated  we may be unable to grow sales of our products 
although cmos technology has been available for over years  cmos technology has been used in image sensors only relatively recently 
along with the other risk factors described in this section  the following are examples of factors that may delay the increasing adoption of the cmos fabrication process and our single chip technology for mass market image sensor applications the failure of the emergence of a universal platform for imaging solutions for computers and the internet  improvements in or price reductions for ccd image sensors  which could slow the adoption of cmos image sensors in markets already dominated by ccd image sensors or prevent or delay the adoption of cmos image sensors in emerging markets  the failure to develop easy to use and affordable products using cmos image sensors  and the failure of emerging markets such as automotive  personal identification systems and medical imaging devices to develop for products incorporating cmos technology 
the occurrence of any of these factors could adversely affect our ability to sustain and grow our business and increase our revenues and earnings 
if we do not forecast customer demand correctly  our business could be impaired as a result of excess inventory or the loss of existing or potential customers 
our sales are generally made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term purchase commitments and we manufacture products and build inventory based on our estimates of customer demand 
accordingly  we must rely on multiple assumptions concerning forecasted customer demand 
in addition  our customers may cancel or defer orders at any time 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may manufacture products that we may be unable to sell  or we may have to sell our products to other customers at lower prices 
this could materially and adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
if we underestimate customer demand  we may be unable to manufacture sufficient product quickly enough to meet actual demand  causing us to lose customers and impairing our ability to grow our business 
we have experienced problems with accurately forecasting customer demand in the past 
for example  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  the demand for our camerachips for use in pc cameras decreased significantly and one of our significant oem customers unexpectedly cancelled its purchase orders 

table of contents we maintain a backlog of customer orders which is subject to cancellation or delay in delivery schedules  and any cancellation or delay may result in lower than anticipated revenues 
our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders 
we include in our backlog only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within the upcoming months 
although our backlog is typically filled within two to four quarters  orders constituting our current backlog are subject to cancellation or changes in delivery schedules  and backlog may not necessarily be an indication of future revenue 
any cancellation or delay in orders which constitute our current or future backlog may result in lower than expected revenues 
our bookings visibility continues to be limited with a substantial majority of our quarterly product revenues coming from orders that are received and filled in the same quarter 
problems with wafer manufacturing yields could result in higher operating costs  and could impair our ability to meet customer demand for our products 
if the foundries manufacturing the wafers used in our products cannot achieve expected yields  we may incur higher per unit costs and reduced product availability 
any reduction in our ability to timely deliver products to customers could adversely affect our customer relations and make it more difficult to sustain and grow our business 
foundries that supply our wafers have experienced problems in the past achieving acceptable wafer manufacturing yields 
wafer yields are a function of both our design technology and the particular foundry s manufacturing process technology 
low yields may result from design errors or manufacturing failures in new or existing products 
we perform a final test of our products after they are assembled  as their optical nature makes earlier testing difficult and expensive 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until our products are well into the production process 
the risks associated with low yields are exacerbated because we rely on third party offshore foundries for our wafers  which increases the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
we depend on a limited number of third party wafer foundries  which reduces our ability to control our manufacturing process 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
instead  we rely on taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  or tsmc  and powerchip semiconductor company  or psc  to produce a substantial majority of our wafers 
samsung has fabricated and may in the future fabricate one of our interface chips on its standard fabrication line 
we do not have long term supply agreements with any of our foundries and instead secure manufacturing availability on a purchase order basis 
these foundries have no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our reliance on these third party foundries involves a number of significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  and unavailability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies 
our reliance on a limited number of foundries also increases our risk of capacity shortages 
our requirements represent a small portion of the total production capacities of these foundries and  without long term agreements  foundries may reallocate capacity to other customers  even during periods of high demand for our products 
in addition  such foundries could suffer financial difficulties or disruptions in their operations due to causes beyond our control 
if any of our foundries were to become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our wafers in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and costs  and in a timely manner  we would have to identify and qualify substitute foundries  which would be time consuming and difficult  and could increase our costs or result in unforeseen manufacturing and operations problems 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases  our product costs may increase  and we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to manufacturing services 
we are also exposed to additional risks if 
table of contents we transfer our production of semiconductors from one foundry to another as such transfer could interrupt our manufacturing process 
we rely on third party service providers for color filter processing and packaging services  which reduces our control over delivery schedules  product quality and cost  and could adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers 
we rely on tsmc and toppan for the color filter processing of our completed wafers 
in addition  we rely on kyocera and sun yang digital image  or sydi  for substantially all of our ceramic chip packages  which are generally used in our higher priced products  another service provider for our plastic chip packages  which are generally used in our lower priced products  and yet another service provider for chip scale packages  which are generally used in our products designed for the smallest form factor applications 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these service providers and typically obtain services on a purchase order basis 
if for any reason one or more of these service providers becomes unable or unwilling to continue to provide color filter processing or packaging services of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  our ability to deliver our products to our customers could be severely impaired 
we would quickly have to identify and qualify substitute service providers  which could be time consuming and difficult and could result in unforeseen operations problems 
substitute service providers might not be available or  if available  might be unwilling or unable to offer services on acceptable terms 
in addition  if competition for color filter processing or packaging capacity increases  we may be required to pay or invest significant amounts to secure access to these services which could adversely impact our operating results 
there are a limited number of companies that provide these services  some of which have limited operating histories and financial resources 
in the event our current providers refuse or are unable to continue to provide these services to us  we may be unable to procure services from alternate service providers 
furthermore  if customer demand for our products increases  we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current service providers on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
moreover  our reliance on a limited number of third party service providers to provide color filter processing services subjects us to reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance and costs 
this lack of control may cause us to incur unforeseen product shortages or may increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products  which would adversely affect our operating results 
our ability to deliver products that meet customer demand is dependent upon our ability to meet new and changing requirements for color filter processing  assembly and product packaging 
we expect that as we develop new products to meet technology advances and new and changing industry and customer demand  our color filter processing and ceramic and plastic packaging requirements will also evolve 
our ability to continue to profitably deliver products that meet customer demand is dependant upon our ability to procure third party services that meet these new requirements on a cost effective basis 
we have historically relied exclusively on third parties to provide these services  and there can be no assurances that these third parties will be able to develop enhancements to the services that they provide to us that meet these new and changing industry and customer requirements 
furthermore  even if these third party service providers are able to develop their services to meet new and evolving requirements  these services may not be available at a cost that enables us to sustain profitability 
the assembly and packaging of our image sensors into camera modules further complicates and reduces our ability to control the manufacturing process  and may decrease our gross margins 
recently  some of our camera manufacturer customers have requested that we deliver our camerachips in the more finished form of camera modules 
this increases the complexity of the overall manufacturing process and  as a result  may result in decreased yields 
we have engaged third party contract manufacturers to assemble and package our image sensors into camera modules  requiring us to manage service provider relationships that 
table of contents have not historically been a part of our business 
if these third party contract manufacturers are unable to provide timely  reliable and high quality assembly and packaging services  we could experience product shortages and be unable to fill customer orders  resulting in loss of revenues  damage to our reputation and an adverse effect on our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
moreover  we must purchase and hold in our inventory products that are not related to our business in order to deliver our image sensors in a more finished form  which adds complexity to the overall manufacturing process and increases inventory risks 
the gross margin percentage we realize on modules has been lower than the gross margin percentage we have achieved historically on our camerachips  and we expect this to continue 
in addition  if we are unable to realize a premium in selling price for camera modules compared to our camerachips that is greater than the cost of assembling and packaging camera modules  our profitability would also be adversely affected 
if we are unable to successfully streamline our manufacturing process  we may be unable to control our costs  resulting in reductions to our gross margins 
currently  wafer production  color filtering and sensor packaging of our camerachips is performed in asia by third party manufacturers and service providers 
substantially all of our camerachips are then shipped to our facility in the united states where they undergo additional sensor testing before being shipped back to asia for assembly and final testing 
this process is time consuming and the multiple transits can result in damaged products 
accordingly  we intend to consolidate our testing operations in china prior to the end of calendar in addition  over the next months we expect to consolidate additional manufacturing processes in asia in order to reduce our costs of revenues and to achieve other benefits such as decreased risks from transit  reduced time to market for our camerachips  and reduced inventory and lead times 
however  we may never be able to achieve the anticipated cost saving benefits of this consolidation  resulting in failure to improve our gross margins 
we may never achieve the anticipated benefits from our planned operations in shanghai  china 
in december  we established a chinese subsidiary as part of our efforts to streamline our manufacturing process and reduce the costs associated with the testing of our camerachips 
prior to the end of calendar  we intend to consolidate our testing operations in shanghai  china 
in addition  over the next months we anticipate expanding the scope of our operations at our china facility to include other manufacturing processes such as color filter applications and sensor packaging 
however  there are significant administrative  legal and governmental risks to operating in china  and we may not achieve the expected cost savings of performing these manufacturing processes in china 
if our operations in china do not result in offsetting gains in the form of operating cost reductions  whether because of the risks and difficulties entailed by foreign operations or for other reasons  our business and financial condition will be adversely affected 
operating in china involves substantial risks that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  in particular attracting and retaining personnel qualified to design  sell and support cmos image sensors  difficulties in coordinating our operations in china with those in california  diversion of management attention  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across our global operations  including inventory management and financial consolidation  political and economic instability  which may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates in asia  and could impair our ability to conduct our business in china  and inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our needs 

table of contents our planned operations in china will require substantial capital expenditures 
we must meet certain minimal capital requirements applicable to our chinese subsidiary 
our chinese subsidiary has million in registered capital  million of which had been funded as of april  of the remaining million  million must be funded by january and million must be funded by january we expect to fund the remaining registered capital through a combination of funds invested from our available working capital or by investments from third parties 
third party financing could include debt financing from banking institutions or an equity financing transaction 
third party financing may not be available to us when and as required or on terms that are favorable to our stockholders and us 
in addition  chinese law may limit the sources that may be eligible to invest in our chinese subsidiary 
in the event we are unable to obtain suitable financing from third parties  we may need to raise additional capital which may require us to issue our equity securities or incur debt 
this additional equity issuance would dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders and the issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of our business 
issuance of debt securities could also impair our financial condition and interest payments on debt securities could have an adverse effect on our results of operation 
we have a limited history of profitability and may be unable to maintain our recent financial success 
we have a limited history of profitability and may be unable to maintain our recent financial success 
if we fail to sustain or increase our levels of profitability  our financial condition may be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock may decline 
since our inception in  we have achieved profitability on an annual basis only on two occasions  in fiscal and fiscal in fiscal we incurred net losses of million  and in fiscal we incurred net losses of million 
in fiscal  the only year in which we were profitable on a fiscal year basis prior to fiscal  our net income was million 
in fiscal our net income was million 
in the future  we expect to incur significant expenses  including expenses related to our research and development efforts  and our operations in china and capital commitments to our chinese subsidiary  which could impair our ability to sustain profitability 
in addition  as we hire additional personnel  we expect selling  general and administrative and other expenses to increase 
other risks associated with our business described elsewhere in this section could also affect our ability to sustain profitability 
if our revenues do not increase or if we cannot effectively control our expenses  we may be unable to sustain profitability at levels consistent with our financial performance in fiscal  or at all 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property and therefore we may lose some of our competitive advantage 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
we have been issued patents and have a number of pending united states and foreign patent applications 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any patent will issue as a result of any applications or  if issued  that any claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  it is possible that existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
for example  ic media has initiated a cancellation proceeding in taiwan with respect to one of our patents 
if ic media is successful  we may lose or suffer diminished rights in the challenged patent 
if we are not successful in suits in which we claim that third parties infringe our patents or other intellectual property  our competitive position may be adversely affected 
furthermore  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop corresponding technology independently or design around our patents 
effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
any disputes over our intellectual property rights may result in costly and time consuming litigation or the license of additional elements of our intellectual property for little or no compensation 

table of contents we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property  which could divert management attention  be costly to defend and prevent us from using or selling the challenged technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving intellectual property rights  including rights of companies in the semiconductor industry 
we have in the past and may in the future be subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents  product liabilities and other actions arising out of the normal course of business 
these claims may increase as our intellectual property portfolio becomes larger or more valuable 
intellectual property claims against us  and any resulting lawsuit  may cause us to incur significant expenses  subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights 
for example  in fiscal we paid million to settle a litigation matter 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and could divert management s time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation against us could also force us to take actions such as ceasing the sale or use of products or services that incorporate the infringed intellectual property  obtaining from the holder of the infringed intellectual property a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or redesigning those products or services that incorporate the disputed intellectual property  which could result in substantial unanticipated development expenses and prevent us from selling the products until the redesign is completed  if at all 
if we are subject to a successful claim of infringement and we fail to develop non infringing intellectual property or license the infringed intellectual property on acceptable terms and on a timely basis  we may be unable to sell some or all of our products and our operating results could be adversely affected 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors 
these claims could also result in significant expense and the diversion of technical and management personnel s attention 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our ability to increase our revenues and improve our earnings could be adversely affected 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our management and other resources 
in particular  we expect that we will continue to face challenges in managing the expansion of our operations in china 
to manage our growth effectively  we must  among other things implement and improve operational  financial and accounting systems  train and manage our employee base  and attract and retain qualified personnel with relevant experience 
in addition  in recent fiscal quarters we have also seen significant growth in the level of our inventory and accounts receivables  primarily as a result of our revenue growth in fiscal our failure to effectively manage our inventory levels could result in either excess inventories  which could adversely affect our gross margins and operating results  or lead to an inability to fill customer orders  which would result in lower sales and could harm our relationships with existing and potential customers 
we must also manage multiple relationships with customers  business partners and other third parties  such as our foundries and process and assembly vendors 
moreover  our growth may significantly overburden our management and financial systems and other resources 
we may not make adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with our expansion 
in addition  our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations  and we may not be able to expand quickly enough to capitalize on potential market opportunities 
our future operating results will also depend on our ability to expand sales and marketing  research and development  accounting  finance and administrative support 

table of contents our future tax rates could be higher than expected if the proportion of future operating income generated outside the us by our foreign affiliates is less than we expect 
a number of factors will affect our tax rate in the future  and the combined effect of these factors could result in an increase in our effective rate as compared to our effective tax rate in fiscal this will adversely affect our operating results 
a key factor that will cause the rate to increase is that the financial statement benefit of reversing the valuation allowance offsetting net deferred tax assets has already been fully recognized as of the end of fiscal if our foreign affiliates are unable to achieve operating income in fiscal  our effective tax rate in fiscal may be higher than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
we expect that our tax rate for fiscal will be higher than our effective tax rate in fiscal further  our tax provision may vary from quarter to quarter and our effective tax rate could be higher than we expect 
our industry and our customers industries are highly cyclical and currently are experiencing a severe downturn  which has adversely affected and may continue to impact our revenues 
the current global economic slowdown has adversely impacted the businesses of our customers and distributors and  as a result  has also adversely affected our business and operating results 
additional declines in our customers markets or in general economic conditions would likely result in a further reduction in demand for our products 
in the past  the results of these economic cycles have negatively impacted our business 
for example  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  our customers and distributors  primarily our pc video camera customers and distributors  cancelled or did not place expected orders for our products 
if the macroeconomic climate  especially with respect to investments in technology such as ours  does not improve  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition  if the demand for our products  in particular from the digital still camera and cell phone camera markets  does not increase as we expect  or if it were to lessen for any reason  we may not be able to meet analysts projections for future operating results  which would likely cause our stock price to decline  potentially significantly 
in addition  the semiconductor industry in general is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand and has been experiencing a sustained decline 
downturns in the industry often occur in connection with  or anticipation of  maturing product cycles for both semiconductor companies and their customers and declines in general economic conditions 
these downturns have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of average selling prices 
in some cases  these downturns have lasted multiple years 
our sales through distributors increase the complexity of our business  which may increase our operating costs and may reduce our ability to forecast revenues 
during fiscal  of our sales were made through distributors 
selling through distributors reduces our ability to accurately forecast sales and increases the complexity of our business  requiring us to  among other matters manage a more complex supply chain  manage the level of inventory at each distributor  provide for credits  return rights and price protection  estimate the impact of credits  return rights  price protection and unsold inventory at distributors  and monitor the financial condition and credit worthiness of our distributors 
any failure to manage these challenges could cause us to inaccurately forecast sales and carry excess inventory  thereby adversely affecting our operating results 

table of contents failure to obtain design wins could cause our market share and revenues to decline and could impair our ability to grow our business in the future 
our future success is dependent upon manufacturers  such as cell phone and camera manufacturers  designing our camerachips into their products 
to achieve design wins  which are decisions by those manufacturers to design our products into their systems  we must define and deliver cost effective  innovative and integrated semiconductor solutions 
our ability to achieve design wins is subject to numerous risks including competitive pressures as well as technological risks 
if we do not achieve a design win with a prospective customer  it may be difficult to sell our camerachips to such prospective customer in the future because once a manufacturer has designed a supplier s products into its systems  the manufacturer may be reluctant to change its source of components due to the significant costs  time  effort and risk associated with qualifying a new supplier 
in addition  a decision by manufacturers to offer our products in attachments or add ons to  rather than embedded in  their products could limit our market share or revenues because the manufacturer may more easily switch to a competitive product 
accordingly  if we fail to achieve design wins with key camera device manufacturers that embed image sensors in their products  our market share or revenues could decrease 
furthermore  to the extent that our competitors secure design wins  our ability to expand our business in the future will be impaired 
our lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly cycle  in addition to our customers design cycle  may result in uncertainty and delays in generating revenues 
manufacturing our image sensors requires a lengthy manufacturing  packaging and assembly process  typically lasting fourteen to sixteen weeks or more 
additional time may pass before a customer commences volume shipments of products that incorporate our image sensors 
even when a manufacturer decides to design our image sensors into its products  the manufacturer may never ship final products incorporating our image sensors 
given this lengthy cycle  we experience a delay between the time we incur expenditures for research and development and sales and marketing efforts and the time we generate revenues  if any  from these expenditures 
this delay makes it more difficult to forecast customer demand which adds uncertainty to the manufacturing planning process and could adversely affect our operating results 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance and may result in volatility in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and are likely to vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors and other industry risks  many of which are more fully discussed in our other risk factors  include our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products  our ability to achieve acceptable wafer manufacturing yields  the gain or loss by us of a large customer  our ability to manage our product transitions  the mix of the products we sell and the distribution channels through which they are sold  and the availability of production capacities at the semiconductor foundries that manufacture our products or components of our products 
in the past  our introduction of new products and our product mix have affected our quarterly operating results 
changes in our product mix could adversely affect our operating results because some products provide higher margins than others 
for example  our gross margin on revenues from sales of our new line of camera module products are lower than sales of our more established image sensor products 
we typically experience 
table of contents lower yields when manufacturing new products through the initial production phase  and consequently our gross margins on new products have historically been lower than our gross margins on our older  more established products 
we also anticipate that the rate of orders from our customers may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
our expenses  including our future capital commitments to our chinese subsidiary  and our inventory levels  are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed 
consequently  if we do not achieve revenues in any quarter as expected  expenses and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and our operating results for that quarter  and potentially future quarters  may be harmed 
certain other factors have in the past caused and are likely in the future to cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these factors are industry risks over which we have little or no control  including the growth of the market for products and applications using cmos image sensors  the timing and size of orders from our customers  the volume of our product returns  the seasonal nature of customer demand for our products  the deferral of customer orders in anticipation of new products  product designs or enhancements by us  and the announcement and introduction of products and technologies by our competitors 
any one or more of these factors is difficult to forecast and could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
our operating results in a given quarter could be substantially less than anticipated and if we fail to meet market analyst expectations  a substantial decline in our stock price could result 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results could adversely affect the price of our common stock in a manner unrelated to our long term operating performance 
our success depends on the timely development and introduction of new products  which we might not be able to achieve 
the development of new products is highly complex  and we have in the past experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
as our products integrate new and more advanced functions  they become more complex and increasingly difficult to design and debug 
successful product development and introduction depend on a number of factors  including accurate prediction of market requirements and evolving standards  including pixel resolution  output interface standards  power requirements  optical lens size  input standards and operating systems for personal computers and other platforms  development of advanced technologies and capabilities  definition  timely completion and introduction of new products that satisfy customer requirements  development of products that maintain a technological advantage over the products of our competitors  including our current advantages with respect to the functionality and pixel capability of our camerachips and our proprietary testing processes  and market acceptance of the new products 
accomplishing all of this is time consuming and expensive 
we may be unable to develop new products or product enhancements in time to capture market opportunities or achieve a significant or sustainable acceptance in new and existing markets 
in addition  our products could become obsolete sooner than anticipated because of a faster than anticipated change in one or more of the technologies related to our products 
the failure to 
table of contents successfully develop new products that achieve market acceptance in a timely fashion would adversely affect our ability to grow our business and our operating results 
we face foreign business  political and economic risks because a majority of our products and those of our customers are manufactured and sold outside of the united states 
we face difficulties in managing our third party foundries  color filter application service providers and ceramic and plastic packaging service providers  all of whom are located in asia  and our foreign distributors 
potential political and economic instability in asia may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates and could cause service disruptions from our vendors 
sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal and of our revenues in fiscal we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in future periods 
dependence on sales to foreign customers involves certain risks  including longer payment cycles  the adverse effects of tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions that impair trade  decreased visibility as to future demand  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  and burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and labor practices 
sales of our products have been denominated to date exclusively in us dollars 
therefore  increases in the value of the us dollar will increase the price of our products in the currency of the countries in which our customers are located 
this may result in our customers seeking lower priced suppliers  which could adversely impact our operating results 
a portion of our international revenues may be denominated in foreign currencies in the future  which would subject us to risks associated with fluctuations in those foreign currencies 
the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system presents certain risks and financial requirements 
we are currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning  or erp  system which is critical to the accounting and financial functions of our company 
in addition  the new erp system imposes certain financial and various other demands due to the cost of implementation 
the erp system also imposes certain risks inherent in the conversion to a new computer system  including disruption to our accounting controls and problems achieving accuracy in the conversion of electronic data 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of management s attention and resources  and could materially adversely affect our operating results and impact our ability to manage our business 
we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our alliances with  and strategic investments in  third parties 
we expect to develop our business through forming alliances or joint ventures with  and making strategic investments in  other companies  some of which may be companies at a relatively early stage of development 
for example  in april we completed an investment in a chip scale packaging service company  and in june we completed an investment in a packaging service company 
we expect to increase our reliance on partnerships  strategic alliances and investments  particularly those that enhance our service and manufacturing capacity 
these investments and partnering arrangements are crucial to our ability to grow our business and meet the increasing demands of our customers 
however  we can not ensure that we will achieve the benefits expected as a result of these alliances 
in addition  we may be required to account for some of these investments under the equity method or to consolidate them into our operating results 
under such circumstances  losses that such companies incur could also adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents the high level of complexity and integration of our products increases the risk of latent defects  which could damage customer relationships and increase our costs 
because we integrate many functions on a single chip  our products are complex and are based upon evolving technology 
the integration of additional functions on and complex operations of our products could result in a greater risk that customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults after volumes of product have already been shipped 
although we test our products  we have in the past and may in the future encounter defects or errors 
delivery of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  product warranty costs for recall and replacement and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
our customers experience fluctuating product cycles and seasonality  which cause our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
some of the products using our camerachips  such as digital still cameras  cell phone cameras and personal computer cameras  are consumer electronics goods 
these mass market camera devices generally have particular seasonality cycles 
for example  sales of our camerachips for use in digital still cameras tends to increase in the second quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of the holiday sales cycle and in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year in anticipation of the sales of digital still cameras in connection with summer vacations 
if we fail to predict accurately and respond appropriately to this consumer demand on a timely basis to meet seasonal fluctuations  or if there is any disruption of consumer buying habits during this key period  our business and operating results would be harmed 
our business could be harmed if we lose the services of one or more members of our senior management team  or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or the decision of one or more of these individuals to join a competitor  could adversely affect our business and harm our operating results and financial condition 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management  in particular  shaw hong  our president and chief executive officer  and raymond wu  our executive vice president  and other key technical personnel 
none of our senior management is bound by an employment or non competition agreement 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified technical particularly analog or mixed signal design engineers  sales  marketing  finance and management personnel 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  our revenues and product development efforts could be harmed 
h 
gene mccown  our vice president of finance and chief financial officer  has announced that he is planning on retiring after his successor is identified in late calendar we may experience difficulty in identifying or attracting a qualified successor 
any delay in hiring or retaining a new chief financial officer or any disruption to our business resulting from the transition of chief financial officer responsibilities could harm our business 
our operations may be impaired as a result of disasters  business interruptions or similar events  including the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
disasters such as earthquakes  water  fire  electricity failure  or accidents affecting our operating activities  major facilities  and employees customers health that occur could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in particular  our operations in china  as well as most of our third party 
table of contents manufacturers and service providers involved in the manufacturing of our products  are located within a relatively close proximity of one another in china 
therefore  any disaster that strikes within close proximity of that geographic area could be tremendously disruptive to our business and could materially and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we do not currently have a disaster recovery plan 
as a result of the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  which has impacted a number of countries in asia  particularly china and singapore  our facilities and or the facilities of our third party manufacturers and service providers located in china could be quarantined or temporarily closed 
if this occurs  it could delay or prevent us from developing new products or manufacturing  testing or shipping our current products  and may require us to find other providers of such services  which may be unavailable or more expensive than our current providers of such services 
further  if the outbreak of sars has an adverse impact on the businesses of our customers  it could reduce the size and or frequency of our customers purchases  which could adversely impact our operating results and our ability to sustain and expand our business 
acts of war and terrorist acts may seriously harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
acts of war or terrorist acts  wherever located around the world  may cause damage or disruption to our business  employees  facilities  suppliers  distributors or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue  costs  expenses and financial condition 
in addition  as a company with significant operations and major distributors and customers located in asia  we may be adversely impacted by heightened tensions and acts of war that occur on the korean peninsula 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
we are uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
risks related to our stock provisions in our charter documents and delaware law  as well as our stockholders rights plan  could prevent or delay a change in control of us and may reduce the market price of our common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable 
these provisions include adjusting the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of preferred stock without stockholder approval  providing for a classified board of directors with staggered  three year terms  requiring supermajority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and prohibiting stockholder actions by written consent 
provisions of delaware law also may discourage  delay or prevent another company from acquiring or merging with us 
our board of directors adopted a preferred stock rights agreement in august pursuant to the rights agreement  our board of directors declared a dividend of one right to purchase one one thousandth share of our series a participating preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we are an international company  selling our products globally  in particular  to branded customers  contract manufacturers  vars and distributors in china  hong kong  japan  korea and taiwan 
although we transact our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products  gross profits realized  and results of operations 
further  we incur expenses in japan  korea  taiwan  thailand  china and other countries that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we cannot estimate the effect that an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates would have on our future operating results or cash flows as a direct result of changes in exchange rates 
however  we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk  and we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments 
market interest rate risk 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in short term bank market rate accounts  certificates of deposit issued by banks  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates
