narrative description of business the company derives the majority of its revenues from providing basic telephone services often referred to as plain old telephone service or pots to residential and business customers within its service territories 
pots revenues consist mainly of fees for local service which are billed directly to customers and access revenues which are received for intrastate and interstate exchange services provided to long distance carriers 
pots revenues are subject to regulation by a number of state and federal government agencies 
the company also earns revenues by providing a number of nonregulated telecommunications services to customers 
the most significant of these nonregulated services is cable television or video service 
other services include internet access services  lease of fiber optic transport facilities  billing and collection services to long distance carriers  telephone directory services  engineering services and equipment rental 
the company also makes retail sales of consumer telecommunications equipment and sells wireless telephone services on a commission basis 
the following table presents the percentage of revenues derived from local service revenues  access revenues  nonregulated telecommunications activities and cable television operations for the last three years year ended december local network network access video services internet services other nonregulated services the company also owns minority interests in joint ventures  partnerships and limited liability corporations llcs that provide a wide variety of telecommunications services  including wireless telephone services  fiber optic transport services and telephone switching services 
the most significant of these investments is midwest wireless holdings llc 
plain old telephone service pots local network the company s lec subsidiaries provide basic local telephone services to residential and business customers in minnesota  wisconsin  south dakota  north dakota and iowa 
local service revenues are earned by providing customers with local service to connecting points within the local exchange boundaries and  in certain cases  to nearby local exchanges under extended area service eas plans that eliminate long distance charges to the neighboring exchanges 
monthly rates for telephone service differ among the lecs depending upon the cost of providing service  the type and grade of service  the number of customers and calling patterns within the toll free calling area and other factors 
the following chart presents the number of access lines served by hector s and alliance s lec subsidiaries at december   and access lines december hector communications corporation arrowhead communications corporation eagle valley telephone company granada telephone company pine island telephone company    indianhead telephone company    total hector access lines    alliance telecommunications corporation loretel systems  inc    sleepy eye telephone company    sioux valley telephone company    hills telephone company    felton telephone company hager telecom  inc    total alliance access lines    total access lines    an access line is a single or multi party circuit between the customer s establishment and the central switching office 
the company s lec subsidiaries offer their customers a number of enhanced telecommunications services  including custom calling features like call waiting  caller identification and voice mail 
charges for custom calling services are generally billed monthly together with the customers local service bill 
the company maintains a local presence in each of its lec subsidiaries 
the company provides its lec subsidiaries with various services  including finance  accounting and treasury services  marketing  customer service  purchasing  engineering and construction  customer billing  rate administration  credit and collection  and development of administrative and procedural practices 
access revenues access revenues are received by lecs for intrastate and interstate exchange services provided to long distance carriers generally referred to as interexchange carriers or ixcs 
these services enable ixcs to provide long distance service to end users in the local exchange network 
access revenues are determined  in the case of interstate calls  according to rules promulgated by the federal communications commission fcc and administered by the national exchange carriers association neca 
in the case of intrastate calls  access revenues are determined by state regulatory agencies 
in  approximately of the company s access revenues were from interstate sources and were from intrastate sources 
a portion of the company s interstate access revenue is derived from subscriber line charges slcs determined by the fcc and billed directly to end users for access to long distance carriers 
another portion consists of universal service funds received based upon the high cost of providing service to rural areas 
the balance of the interstate access revenue is received from neca  which collects payments from ixcs and distributes settlement payments to lecs 
settlement payments are based on a number of factors  including the cost of providing service and the amount of time the local network is utilized to provide long distance services 
through the s and s a variety of factors  including increased subscriber counts  cultural and technological changes  and rate reductions by ixcs  resulted in a consistent pattern of increasing use of the nation s telephone network 
this growth produced higher revenues for neca and increased settlements for its participating lecs 
intrastate access revenues are received from long distance carriers based on recorded customer usage multiplied by the appropriate tariff rate 
where applicable  hcc s lecs participate in intrastate access tariffs approved by state regulatory authorities for intrastate intra lata local access transport area and inter lata services 
these intrastate arrangements are intended to compensate lecs for the costs  including a fair rate of return  of facilities provided in originating and terminating intrastate long distance services 
nonregulated telecommunications activities video services the company  through its cable television and lec subsidiaries  provide cable television services to  subscribers in minnesota and the surrounding states 
video service revenues are derived almost exclusively from monthly fees for basic and premium programming 
fees for basic services range from to per month 
basic service generally includes the major television networks  non network independent stations  sports programming  news services and automated information channels  children s programming  access channels for public  governmental  educational and leased use  senior citizens programming and religious programming 
premium programming services  such as the hbo or showtime movie services  are provided to subscribers for an additional fee of to per month per channel 
premium programming is obtained from suppliers for a flat monthly fee per subscriber and or a fee based on the monthly charge to subscribers for the service 
in and the company deployed broadband equipment manufactured by next level communications  inc in its exchanges serving pine island  mn  goodhue  mn and sleepy eye  mn 
this equipment makes it possible to deliver pots  video and high speed internet services to the customer over the same circuit 
video programming is delivered utilizing a digital super headend owned by broadband visions  llc  in which the company is an investor 
the company is planning to install broadband equipment in additional exchanges in future years 
the company s broadband product offerings are dependent on the availability of equipment from next level communications  inc if the company cannot obtain necessary equipment it could have a material adverse affect on its operations 
internet revenues from internet services were   and  in  and  respectively

they also provide billing and collection services for certain ixcs in lieu of such ixcs directly billing customers within the lec s service areas 
due to changes in market conditions the company renegotiated several of its fiber leases in  resulting in a significant decline in lease revenue 
all of the fiber optic facilities leased are owned by hcc s lec subsidiaries and are located within the lec s local exchange boundaries 
hcc s revenues from other nonregulated services were as follows fiber leases    engineering fees    directory    billing and collection    retail sales    cellular sales commissions    resale of long distance service    equipment rent    other    investments in unconsolidated affiliates midwest wireless holdings llc midwest wireless holdings llc midwest wireless provides wireless telecommunications services to  customers in eleven rural service areas and one metropolitan service area in minnesota  wisconsin and iowa

and neca  inc  which it accounts for using the cost method 
the company also has receivables from economic development loans made through the rural utilities service and has other small investments 
competition telephone service lecs are subject to many forms of competition 
its competitors principally are o facilities based competition from providers  including cable television service providers  with their own local service network  o resale competition from resale interconnection providers who purchase local services from the lec at wholesale rates and resell the services to their customers  o competition from unbundled network element interconnection providers who lease some of the network elements from the lec o wireless providers who may charge a competitive fee for services that could compete with wireline based local service 
rural areas like those served by the company are less likely to experience competition from facilities based competitors due to the significant investment in plant and equipment required in relation to the lower customer density in rural markets 
competition from resale interconnection or unbundled network element interconnection is more likely 
under the telecommunications act of  the company s lecs are not currently required to lease facilities to competitors seeking to interconnect with its networks 
however  there is no assurance that interconnection may not be required in the future 
wireless service has always competed directly with wireline local service among certain classes of customers  principally customers with seasonal or lake homes 
newer wireless service offerings that bundle local and long distance minutes for a flat fee are competing with wireline services over a broader class of customers 
these wireless service offerings can be particularly attractive in rural areas  where the toll free dialing areas offered by wireline carriers are usually quite small 
the company believes that significant numbers of long distance minutes are migrating from the wireline to the wireless network due to these rate plans 
this drives down the revenues of ixcs and negatively impacts the company s access revenues 
developments in technology related to cellular  pcs  digital microwave  coaxial cable  fiber optics and other wireline or wireless services could also lead to greater competition for traditional local services 
lecs are increasingly subject to competition from competing access providers caps which construct  modify or lease facilities that enable high volume long distance users to bypass the local telephone network 
cable television companies may also be able to modify their networks to carry telephone messages that bypass the local telephone network 
the company believes its lec subsidiaries have experienced only a small loss of traffic due to bypass 
video services in addition to competition from off air television  other technologies also supply services that compete with cable television 
these include low power television stations  multi point distribution systems  over the air subscription television and direct broadcast satellite dbs 
cable television also competes for customers in local markets with providers of other forms of entertainment  news and information 
these competitors include radio  newspapers  magazines  motion picture theaters  video cassettes and internet service providers 
all of the company s cable television franchises are non exclusive 
the cable act prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably refusing to grant franchises to competing cable television systems 
the company competes with a municipally owned cable system in one community it serves 
it also competes with a much larger multi system operator in sleepy eye  where the company is using broadband equipment to deliver video services 
the degree of competition from other cable providers will be dependent upon the state and federal regulations concerning entry  interconnection requirements and the degree of unbundling of the lecs networks 
the company expects to compete based upon product  service quality  breadth of services offered and  to a lesser extent  on price 
maintaining and expanding the company s subscriber base depends on numerous factors  including the quality and quantity of signals available from off air television stations  demand for satellite and premium television channels and average household income in the service area 
promotional efforts for video services include telephone and door to door selling and local media advertising 
regulation the company s lecs and cable television systems are subject to federal  state and local regulation 
the communications act of and the telecommunications act of govern federal regulations 
under these federal statutes  the fcc exercises jurisdiction over all interstate telecommunications activities 
intrastate activities are governed by rules and regulations set by the respective state public utility commissions 
federal regulations under federal regulations  incumbent local exchange carriers ilecs are required to comply with the communications act of and rules issued by the fcc 
while the telecommunications act of amended the earlier law to reduce regulatory burdens and promote competition  ilecs remain subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
ilecs are required to maintain accounting records according to uniform system of accounts  to structure access charges according to fcc rules and to reflect their charges for interstate services at a rate of return prescribed by the fcc 
the fcc also regulates transfer of control and assignments of operating authorizations and construction licenses 
the fcc requires carriers providing access services to file tariffs with the fcc reflecting rates  terms and conditions of the services 
tariffs filed are subject to review and potential objection by third parties 
regulation of cost recovery and nonregulated revenue allocation as a regulated common carrier  the company s lec subsidiaries can set maximum rates at a level that allows recovery of reasonable costs incurred to provide regulated service and earns a reasonable return on the investment required to provide these services 
costs are recovered through o monthly charges to end users for basic local telephone services and enhanced services  o access charges to interexchange carriers for originating and terminating interstate and intrastate interexchange calls  and o payments from the federal universal service fund and the state universal service funds where applicable that offset the high cost of providing service in certain rural markets 
rates for regulated services and the amount of universal service fund support are set forth by the fcc with respect to interstate services and by state regulatory agencies with respect to intrastate services 
in conjunction with the recovery of costs and establishment of rates  a lec must first determine its aggregate costs and then allocate those costs between regulated and nonregulated services 
after identifying the regulated costs of providing local telephone service  a lec must allocate those costs among its various local exchange and interstate and intrastate interexchange services and between state and federal jurisdictions 
allocating costs is complicated because the same pieces of a lec s plant and equipment are utilized for different services  such as local telephone and interstate and intrastate access services 
the allocation process is called separation and is governed primarily by fcc regulations 
the purpose of separation is to determine how a carrier s expenses are allocated and recovered from federal and state jurisdictions 
the fcc is considering whether to change or eliminate this process 
any change in separation rules by the fcc could reduce or increase the lec s revenues 
however  at this time it is not possible to predict what changes  if any  may be made 
interstate end user rates the part of the local telephone network running from the switching facility to the customer is called the local loop 
costs to construct  operate and maintain the loop are among the most significant costs incurred by a local exchange carrier 
in the fcc established a rate structure that provides for the recovery of a portion of the cost of the local loop allocated to interstate jurisdiction directly from end users through the assessment of a subscriber line charge 
the slc was increased in to a cap on residence and single line business lines and a cap on multi line business lines 
the remaining portions of the interstate local loop costs were recovered from interstate access charges to interexchange carriers 
in november the fcc adopted access charge reforms based in part on a proposal by the multi association group the mag plan 
the mag plan increases the maximum rate caps for slcs as follows residential and single line business january  increase from to july  increase from to july  increase from to multi line business january  increase from to the increased slc revenues will be offset by reductions in recovery of local loop costs from interexchange carriers 
the plan is intended to be revenue neutral for affected lecs 
due to demographic and geographic conditions  costs to provide local loop and switching services are often higher  on a per customer basis  in rural areas compared to urban areas 
absent a regulatory framework to permit recovery of these costs  rural lecs would be compelled to charge considerably higher rates for local network services 
consequently  the fcc provides for additional interstate recovery by eligible telecommunications carriers through the federal universal service fund 
funds from the federal universal service fund are available to local exchange carriers whose local loop costs are significantly above the national average as determined by fcc rules 
interstate universal service fund support accounted for   and  of the company s network access revenues in  and  respectively 
interstate access rates interstate access rates are developed on the basis of a lec s measurement of its interstate costs to provide access service to ixcs divided by its projected demand for service 
the resulting rates are published in the lec s interstate access tariff and filed with the fcc  at which time they are subject to challenge by third parties and to review by the fcc 
the fcc recognized that the rate making and tariff filing process is administratively burdensome for small local exchange carriers 
in  the fcc established the national exchange carriers association neca to develop and administer interstate access service rates  terms and conditions 
neca develops interstate access rates on the basis of data provided by participating local exchange carriers and blended to yield average rates 
these rates are intended to generate revenue equal to the aggregate costs plus a return on the investment of all of the participants 
individual lecs are likely to have service costs that differ from the revenues generated by applying the overall neca tariff rates 
to allow for this  revenues generated by participating lecs are pooled and redistributed on the basis of each individual company s costs 
this process eliminates the burden of individual tariff filing and produces a system in which small companies can share and spread risk 
for example  if a small local exchange carrier filed its own tariff and subsequently suffered the loss of major customers that utilize interstate access service  the local exchange carrier could suffer significant under recovery of its costs 
in the neca pool environment  the impact of this loss is reduced because it is spread over all of the pool participants 
neca operates separate pools for traffic sensitive costs primarily switching costs and non traffic sensitive costs primarily loop costs 
lecs can choose to develop and administer their own interstate access charges and not participate in the neca pools 
hcc s lecs located in minnesota and wisconsin participate in the traffic sensitive neca pools 
hcc s lecs located in iowa and south dakota do not participate in the traffic sensitive neca pools 
all of hcc s lecs participate in the non traffic sensitive neca pools 
the fcc is reviewing its rates and policies governing interstate access and the rate of return applicable to incumbent local exchange carriers who are subject to rate of return  rather than price cap  regulation 
the outcome of this review could directly affect hcc s earnings  however  the outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted at this time 
the telecommunications act the telecommunications act was enacted to promote competition without jeopardizing the availability of nationwide universal service at affordable rates 
these two objectives have resulted in a complex set of rules intended to promote competitive entry in the provision of local telephone services  except where entry would adversely effect the provision of universal service or the public interest 
promotion of local service competition and the rural exemptions the telecommunications act made competitive entry into the local telephone business more attractive to other carriers by removing barriers to competition 
in order to promote competition the telecommunications act established new interconnection rules generally requiring local exchange carriers to allow competing carriers to interconnect with their local networks 
congress recognized  however  that the desire to promote competition conflicted with the ability of some existing lecs to provide universal service to high cost customers 
congress exempted these lecs classified as rural telephone companies from interconnection requirements until the continuation of the exemption was no longer in the public interest  as defined in the telecommunications act 
under the telecommunications act  all local exchange carriers  including both incumbent local exchange carriers and new competitive carriers  are required to o offer reasonable and nondiscriminatory resale of their telecommunications services  o ensure that customers can keep their telephone numbers when changing carriers  o ensure that competitors customers can use the same number of digits when dialing and receive nondiscriminatory access to telephone numbers  operator service  directory assistance and directory listing  o ensure access to telephone poles  ducts  conduits and rights of way and o compensate competitors for the costs of terminating traffic 
the telecommunications act also requires incumbent local exchange carriers to o negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of interconnection with any competitive carrier making a bona fide request for same  o interconnect their facilities and equipment with any requesting telecommunications carrier at any technically feasible point  o unbundle and provide nondiscriminatory access to unbundled network elements  such as local loops  switches and transport facilities  at nondiscriminatory rates and on nondiscriminatory terms and conditions  o offer resale interconnection at wholesale rates  o provide reasonable notice of changes in the information necessary for transmission and routing of services over the incumbent local exchange carrier s facilities or in the information necessary for interoperability and o provide for the physical collocation of equipment necessary for interconnection or access to unbundled network elements at the premises of the incumbent local exchange carrier  at rates  terms and conditions that are just  reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
in order to implement interconnection requirements  local exchange carriers generally enter into negotiated interconnection arrangements with competing carriers 
local exchange carriers may also offer interconnection tariffs  available to all competitors 
competitors are required to compensate a local exchange carrier for the cost of providing interconnection services 
in the case of resale interconnection  the rules provide that the rates charged should be on a wholesale basis and reflect the current retail rates of the incumbent local exchange carrier  excluding the portion of costs avoided by the incumbent local exchange carrier 
in the case of unbundled network element interconnection  rates are based on costing methodologies that employ a forward looking economic cost pricing methodology known as total element long run incremental cost 
the telecommunications act specifies that resale and unbundled network element rates are to be negotiated among the parties  or  if the parties fail to reach an agreement  arbitrated by the relevant state regulatory authority 
once the parties have come to agreement  the proposed rates are subject to final approval by the state regulatory commission 
the company s lec subsidiaries are defined as rural telephone companies under the telecommunications act 
as rural telephone companies  they were granted rural exemptions from the requirements relating to both resale interconnection and unbundled network element interconnections 
the rural exemptions are continued until regulatory authorities determine that interconnection is technically feasible  not unduly economically burdensome and consistent with the telecommunications act s universal service provisions 
promotion of universal service while the telecommunications act promoted congress policy of ensuring that affordable service is provided to consumers universally in rural  high cost areas of the country  the telecommunications act altered the framework for providing universal service by o providing for the identification of those services eligible for universal service support  o requiring the fcc to make implicit subsidies explicit  o expanding the types of communications carriers required to pay universal service support and o allowing competitive local exchange carriers to be eligible for funding 
these and other provisions were intended to make provision of universal service support compatible with a competitive market 
pursuant to the telecommunications act  federal universal service fund payments are only available to carriers that are designated as eligible telecommunications carriers etc by a state public utilities commission 
in areas served by rural lecs  the telecommunications act provides that a state public utilities commission may designate more than one eligible telecommunications carrier  in addition to the incumbent local exchange carrier  only after determining that the designation of an additional eligible telecommunications carrier will serve the public interest 
wireless providers have received etc designation in company served areas in north dakota and iowa  and have applied for etc designation in minnesota 
the addition of a second eligible telecommunications carrier in these service areas could have the effect of reducing the amount of funds available to hcc s lecs from the federal universal service fund 
such a reduction could materially adversely affect hcc s ability to achieve a reasonable rate of return on the capital invested in its network 
state regulation of rural lecs hcc s lec subsidiaries are subject to regulation by minnesota  south dakota  iowa and wisconsin regulatory agencies with respect to o intrastate toll rates  o intrastate access charges billed to intrastate ixcs  o service areas  o service standards  o accounting and related matters  and o the use of radio frequencies in telephone operations in some cases state regulations also apply to local service rates  rate of return  depreciation rates  construction plans and borrowings  and certain other financial transactions 
local service rates are not directly determined by regulatory authorities  but are limited by regulation of these other areas 
the company has sought appropriate increases in local and other service rates and approval for changes in rate structures necessary to achieve reasonable rates and earnings 
the bulk of the company s access lines are located in minnesota 
a bill passed by the minnesota legislature allows telephone companies serving fewer than  access lines to elect to provide service under an alternate form of regulation 
companies choosing alternative regulation agreed not to increase rates for two years  other than in extraordinary circumstances 
these companies are not subject to rate of return review by the public utilities commission for the same two years 
all of hcc s minnesota based lec subsidiaries except felton telephone company elected alternative rate regulation election effective january  local rate increases after january  are not subject to review by the minnesota public utilities commission unless the lower of or five percent of customers file a petition requesting such review 
in  the company increased its local service rate for sleepy eye telephone company 
the commission did not review the rate increase 
the minnesota public utilities commission is investigating intrastate access rates charged by local telephone companies to ixcs 
the commission has proposed a plan reducing intrastate access charges and implementing a state universal service fund to compensate high cost companies 
the company cannot predict the outcome of the rate investigation or if any part of the proposed plan will be adopted 
cable television system regulation the fcc regulates the providers of satellite communications services and facilities for the transmission of programming services  the cable television systems that carry such services  and  to some extent  the availability of the programming services themselves through its regulation of program licensing 
municipalities and other state and local government authorities also regulate cable television systems 
fcc regulations contain many detailed provisions including o must carry rules regarding the broadcast television and translator signals that must be included in channel offerings to subscribers  o exclusivity provisions which require the deletion of certain programming carried by out of area stations where it would duplicate programming carried by local stations  o technical standards and performance testing requirements  and o franchise fees applicable to state and local cable television franchises 
thus far  hcc s cable systems have not experienced any difficulty in complying with the fcc rules 
in minnesota  the award of cable franchises and certain aspects of cable operations are subject to rules of the minnesota cable communications board 
cable television systems are operated under year  non exclusive franchises granted by local government authorities 
franchises contain many conditions  including time limitations on commencement or completion of construction  approval of initial fees charged to subscribers for basic service  the number of channels offered and the types of programming 
hcc does not anticipate difficulty in obtaining renewal of its franchises at the expiration of their current terms 
the regulation of cable television at the federal  state and local levels is subject to the political process and has been in constant flux over the past decade 
this process continues in the context of legislative proposals for new laws and the adoption or deletion of administrative regulations and policies 
the company anticipates further material developments in these areas  but cannot anticipate their direction and impact on its cable television operations 
business strategy the company is focused on business opportunities in rural telecommunications 
its three part strategy is to o expand its existing operations through internal growth o pursue acquisitions of attractive properties  particularly the acquisition of additional rural telephone exchanges and cable television properties o participate in opportunities afforded by new telecommunication technologies future growth in existing telephone and cable operations is expected to come from providing service to new or presently unserved homes and businesses  from sales of enhanced services to existing customers and from providing new services made possible by improvements in technology 
the company continually assesses possible acquisition opportunities 
competition to acquire attractive telephone or cable television properties is intense 
acquisitions of rural telephone exchanges are subject to the approval of regulatory agencies in some states and  in some cases  to federal waivers that may affect the form of regulation or amount of interstate cost recovery of acquired telephone exchanges 
the company will aggressively pursue acquisitions of telephone exchanges  but there is no assurance that acquisitions can be made on acceptable terms or that regulatory approval  where required  will be received 
the company has aggressively invested in new telecommunications technologies  primarily through investments in partnerships and limited liability companies 
the company has substantial investments in wireless communications companies  fiber optic transport groups  clecs and internet service providers 
the company intends to pursue additional investment opportunities in the future
