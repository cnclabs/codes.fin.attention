item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations statements contained in this form k that are not historical facts  including  but not limited to  any projections contained herein  are forward looking statements and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
such statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate or continue  or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology 
the actual results of the future events described in such forward looking statements in this form k could differ materially from those stated in such forward looking statements 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are adverse economic conditions  industry competition and other competitive factors  adverse weather conditions such as high water  low water  fog and ice  marine accidents  lock delays  construction of new equipment by competitors  including construction with government assisted financing  government and environmental laws and regulations  and the timing  magnitude and number of acquisitions made by the company 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectable receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectable amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectable amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  a significant change in the level of uncollectable amounts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in income 
routine maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred on an annual basis 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance 
acquisitions and leases on october   the company s subsidiary  marine systems  completed the acquisition of powerway for  in cash 
on november   marine systems completed the acquisition of west kentucky for an aggregate consideration of  consisting of  in cash  the assumption of  of west kentucky s existing debt and  in merger costs 
in february  the company  through its marine transportation segment  entered into a long term lease with union carbide for inland tank barges 
the inland tank barges  all double hull  have a total capacity of  barrels 
the inland tank barges were acquired by dow as part of the february  merger between union carbide and dow 
the company has a long term contract with dow to provide for dow s bulk liquid inland marine transportation requirements throughout the united states inland waterway system 
with the merger between union carbide and dow  the company s long term contract with dow was amended to provide for union carbide s bulk liquid inland marine transportation requirements 
at the inception of the lease  the union carbide barges were used exclusively in union carbide service 
partial transition of the tank barges into the company s marine transportation fleet began in the third quarter and was completed during september in march  the company purchased the cargo carriers fleet of inland tank barges for  in cash from cargill  and resold six of the tank barges for  in april on october   the company completed the acquisition of seven inland tank barges and inland towboats from coastal for  in cash 
in addition  the company and coastal entered into a barge management agreement whereby the company will serve as manager of the two companies combined black oil fleet for a period of seven years 
the combined black oil fleet consists of barges owned by coastal and the company s black oil barges 
in a related transaction  on september   the company purchased from coastal three black oil tank barges for  in cash 
on december   the company purchased the inland tank barges leased in february  as noted above  from union carbide for  nine of the tank barges were out of service and will be sold 
on january   the company purchased from seariver  the us transportation affiliate of exxonmobil  double hull inland tank barges and seven inland towboats for  in cash  and assumed from seariver the leases of double hull inland tank barges 
on february   the company purchased three double hull inland tank barges leased by seariver from banc of america leasing for  in cash

marine transportation the company  through its marine transportation segment  is a provider of marine transportation services  operating a current fleet of active inland tank barges and active inland towing vessels  transporting petrochemicals  refined petroleum products  black oil products and agricultural chemicals along the united states inland waterways 
the marine transportation segment is also the managing partner of a owned offshore marine partnership  consisting of four dry bulk barge and tug units 
the partnership is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the following table sets forth the company s marine transportation segment s revenues  costs and expenses  operating income and operating margins for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to marine transportation revenues    costs and expenses costs of sales and operating expenses    selling  general and administrative    taxes  other than on income    depreciation and other amortization    amortization of goodwill  n a  operating income    operating margins compared with marine transportation revenues revenues for compared with declined  reflecting a overall continued weakness in petrochemical volumes  lower refined products volumes into the midwest and lower liquid fertilizer volumes 
during  petrochemical volumes along the gulf coast remained depressed  the continued impact of the sluggish us economy  however  petrochemical volumes into the midwest improved in the second half of with the gradual replenishment of low inventory levels by midwest manufacturers 
late in the fourth quarter  petrochemical volumes along the gulf coast reflected some improvement 
refined products volumes began the year strong  declined during the first quarter  remained weak the entire second quarter  and improved during the second half 
during the first half  high midwest refined products inventories and a new refined products pipeline from the gulf coast to the midwest that went online april   negatively impacted the volumes moved by inland tank barge 
during the second half  the movement of refined products into the midwest returned to more traditional levels  or pre levels  driven by seasonal demand variables based on inventory requirements and midwest refinery outages for maintenance 
black oil volumes were below volume levels for the first nine months of in november and december  volumes increased with the addition of the black oil tank barges and towboats purchased from coastal and the barge management agreement signed with coastal for the management of coastal s remaining black oil barges 
liquid fertilizer volumes were weak in the first half  the result of significant rainfall amounts in the midwest that kept farmers out of their fields  reducing the demand for fertilizer usage  thereby reducing the demand for upriver volumes of liquid fertilizer by tank barge 
during the third quarter  volumes returned to normal seasonal levels  but declined in the fourth quarter as a major customer significantly curtailed its fertilizer output due to production problems at its facility 
in late september  tropical storm isidore  and in early october  hurricane lili  both made landfall in central louisiana  creating delays and diversions of marine equipment away from the path of the storms  and thereby lowering the company s third and fourth quarter revenues 
the impact of tropical storm isidore and hurricane lili on the results was an estimated 
per share after taxes 
during the year  approximately of marine transportation volumes were under term contracts and were spot market volumes 
during  contract renewals remained relatively flat 
spot market rates declined approximately to during the first quarter and certain spot market rates declined an additional to during the second quarter 
weak petrochemical and refined products volumes during the first half created lower utilization and excess tank barge capacity industry wide 
during the third quarter  spot market rates remained depressed  even though petrochemical and refined products volumes into the midwest improved 
during the fourth quarter  spot market rates moved higher as petrochemical and refined products volumes improved  however  spot market rates for remained below fourth quarter levels 
marine transportation costs and expenses total costs and expenses for were lower than  primarily reflecting the reduction in revenues for compared with and corresponding lower expenses 
the year included  of amortization of goodwill  which the company ceased amortizing in under sfas no 
costs of sales and operating expenses for decreased compared with the year  primarily reflecting the decrease in marine transportation activity and corresponding lower voyage related expenses 
depending on the amount of volumes moved  the segment adjusts the number of towboats operated and crews required on a daily basis 
the segment operated towboats at december   at march   at june   at september  and at december  the increase in the number of towboats operated from september to december  reflected the fourth quarter acquisition of the coastal vessels and the management of coastal s remaining black oil barge fleet 
partially offsetting the operating cost savings was the negative impact of inclement weather conditions  which decreased revenues and increased operating expenses 
ice conditions  frontal systems and high water during the first half and fourth quarter  and the tropical storm and hurricane noted above in the third and fourth quarters  required additional horsepower to complete movements  additional fuel and other variable expenses associated with longer transit times 
selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased compared with  reflecting lower incentive compensation accruals and professional fees  partially offset by annual salary increases effective january taxes  other than on income for decreased compared with the decrease reflected lower waterway use taxes  the result of decreased marine transportation volumes  and lower franchise taxes attributable to legal restructuring 
depreciation and other amortization expense for increased compared with the increase reflected new inland tank barge additions in and  the acquisition of the cargill barge fleet in march  the acquisition of the black oil barges and towboats from coastal in late october  and the acquisition of tank barges from union carbide in december in addition  the segment decreased the remaining useful lives of certain older tank barges to correspond with the anticipated retirement dates of such barges 
marine transportation operating income and operating margins operating income for was lower than the operating income included  of goodwill amortization expense 
amortization of goodwill ceased january  with the adoption of sfas no 
goodwill will be evaluated annually for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the operating margin for was compared with for  or when adjusted for goodwill amortization expense 
the decline in the operating margin primarily reflected lower spot market rates and relatively flat contract renewals compared with  as well as reduced volumes 
compared with marine transportation revenues revenues for were over revenues 
the increase included revenues generated from the leasing in february of inland tank barges from union carbide 
the marine transportation segment generated approximately  of revenues during from such service 
from the date of the lease until late in the third quarter  the leased barges were employed exclusively in union carbide service 
late in the third quarter  the partial integration of the leased tank barges was completed into the segment s inland tank barge fleet under the terms of the long term contract with dow 
the completed partial integration allowed for the achievement of additional operating synergies and total use of the distribution system 
for the year  the company benefited from strong upriver refined products volumes and favorable black oil volumes 
the company s liquid fertilizer volumes were higher than expected for the first half 
petrochemical volumes were depressed for the entire year  the result of the slow us economy 
the strong midwest refined products volumes were accelerated in mid august by a chicago  illinois area refinery fire  which closed the facility for an estimated six month period 
the facility closure created an anomaly in the normal distribution patterns of refined petroleum products into the midwest 
midwest volumes of refined products remained strong for the remainder of the favorable black oil volumes were primarily driven by the high demand for asphalt for use in rebuilding of the us highway infrastructure 
in addition  in the first half  high natural gas prices aided black oil volumes by creating additional demand for residual fuel as a natural gas substitute for boiler fuel for utility customers 
during the first quarter  and into april and may  high natural gas prices caused the us manufacturers of nitrogen based fertilizer to significantly curtail production 
the agricultural demand for nitrogen based fertilizer was strong  and foreign producers made up the shortfall of domestic production 
the significant importing of liquid fertilizer disrupted the traditional rail and inland tank barge distribution pattern and created additional barging volumes 
liquid fertilizer volumes in the third quarter were at normal levels while the fourth quarter volumes were weak  the result of high midwest inventory levels 
during  approximately of volumes were under term contracts  with spot market volumes 
contract renewals during were generally at modestly higher prices 
spot market rates  after the mid august refinery fire  were generally higher than the first half  the result of increased utilization to meet the demand for refined products volumes into the midwest 
during the first half  and particularly the first quarter  operations were hampered by adverse weather conditions 
along the gulf coast  heavy fog and strong winds caused delays  thereby increasing transit times 
operations on the illinois river ceased for the majority of january due to ice 
in february  march  april and early may  high water caused navigational delays on the mississippi river 
during the second half of  and particularly the third quarter  the segment benefited from favorable weather and water conditions 
marine transportation costs and expenses total costs and expenses for were higher than  in proportion to the higher revenues recorded in the and years included  and  respectively  of amortization of goodwill  which the company ceased amortizing in costs of sales and operating expenses were higher in compared with the increase was in proportion to the higher revenues recorded in the year included lease costs  as well as operating expenses  associated with the february leasing of inland tank barges from union carbide 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were higher than the increase primarily reflected higher salaries  bonus and profit sharing accruals  and the hiring of additional personnel as a result of the leasing of inland tank barges from dow 
taxes  other than on income was higher in than  primarily reflecting increased waterway use taxes associated with higher business activity levels  including the additional dow business 
depreciation and other amortization increased for compared with the increase primarily resulted from the addition of eleven new tank barges placed into service during and marine transportation operating income and operating margins operating income for increased compared with and the operating margin was in and for excluding amortization of goodwill  the operating margin for was compared with for the slight decline in the operating margin for compared with reflected reduced petrochemical volumes during  as petrochemical volumes typically earn a higher operating margin than refined products and liquid fertilizer volumes 
diesel engine services the company  through its diesel engine services segment  sells genuine replacement parts  provides service mechanics to overhaul and repair large medium speed diesel engines and reduction gears  and maintains facilities to rebuild component parts or entire large medium speed diesel engines or entire reduction gears 
the segment services the marine  power generation and industrial  and railroad markets 
the following table sets forth the company s diesel engine services segment s revenues  costs and expenses  operating income and operating margins for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to diesel engine services revenues    costs and expenses costs of sales and operating expenses    selling  general and administrative    taxes  other than on income depreciation and other amortization amortization of goodwill n a operating income    operating margins compared with diesel engine services revenues revenues for compared with were relatively flat  benefiting from a strong power generation  industrial and railroad markets  thereby offsetting a weak gulf coast oil and gas services market  a market weak since the second half of the power generation market benefited from favorable service and parts sales to the nuclear industry 
sales to the railroad market benefited from the july agreement with emd to distribute replacement parts for locomotive engines used by certain us transit and class ii railroads  and improved service and parts sales to a slightly improved us steel industry 
diesel engine services costs and expenses costs and expenses for compared with were in line with revenues  remaining relatively flat 
the year included  of amortization of goodwill  which the company ceased amortizing in  in accordance with sfas no 
diesel engine services operating income and operating margins operating income for the diesel engine services segment for was higher than  primarily the result of the  of goodwill amortization recorded in the operating margin for was compared with for  or adjusted for amortization of goodwill 
the operating margin for was positively influenced by increased power generation revenues  which historically earn a higher gross profit margin  and negatively influenced by increased railroad revenues  which historically earn a lower gross profit margin 
compared with diesel engine services revenues revenues for reflected a increase when compared with the year included a full year of revenues from two service company acquisitions  powerway  acquired in october and west kentucky in november  as well as from an agreement signed in july with emd as noted above 
during  the power generation market was strong  reflecting favorable nuclear parts sales  and the gulf coast oil and gas services market was strong in the first half  however  weakened in the second half of the year 
the shortline and industrial railroad market remained weak for the entire year 
diesel engine services costs and expenses costs and expenses for generally increased in proportion to the higher revenues in over  reflecting the full year impact of the two acquisitions  powerway in october and west kentucky in november of and the impact of the july agreement with emd 
diesel engine services operating income and operating margins operating income for the diesel engine services segment for was higher than  however  the operating margin declined to for compared with for the decline in the operating margin for was primarily attributable to increased lower margin replacement parts sales to the transit and class ii railroads 
general corporate expenses general corporate expenses for  and were   and  respectively 
the decline in compared with reflected lower employee incentive compensation accruals and professional fees  partially offset by annual salary increases effective january other income and expenses the following table sets forth the impairment of long lived assets  merger related charges  gain on disposition of assets  equity in earnings of marine affiliates  impairment of equity investment  other income expense  minority interests and interest expense for the three years ended december  dollars in thousands change change to to impairment of long lived assets  n a n a merger related charges n a gain on disposition of assets  equity in earnings of marine affiliates   impairment of equity investment  n a n a other income expense minority interests interest expense    asset impairments during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded  of non cash pre tax impairment charges 
the after tax effect of the charges was  or 
per share 
of the total pre tax charges   was due to reduced estimated cash flows resulting from reduced lives on the company s single hull fleet and its commitment to sell certain vessels during the reduced estimated useful lives on single hull tank barges is due to market bias against single hull tank barges and the assessment of the impact of new regulations issued in september by the us coast guard that require the installation of tank level monitoring devices on all single hull tank barges by october the company plans to retire all of its single hull tank barges by october  the company has committed to sell inactive or out of service double hull tank barges and five inactive towboats during and has reduced the carrying value of these vessels by  to fair value of  the charges also included a  write down of an investment in a non consolidated affiliate to its estimated fair value and a  write down of surplus diesel shop equipment 
gain on disposition of assets the company reported net gains on disposition of assets of  in   in and  in the net gains were predominantly from the sale of marine equipment 
equity in earnings of marine affiliates equity in earnings of marine affiliates  consisting primarily of a owned offshore marine partnership  declined to  a decrease for compared with  and declined  or for compared with during the  and years  the four offshore dry cargo barge and tugboats units owned through the owned partnership with a public utility were generally employed under the partnership s contract to transport coal across the gulf of mexico  with a separate contract for the backhaul of limestone rock 
the lower results for primarily reflected reduced rates on the recently renewed coal transportation contract  and the timing of maintenance on three of the four units in the partnership 
the results for reflected major maintenance at the customer s docking facility which closed the facility for a portion of the third quarter  and the company s decision to conduct maintenance on two of the offshore barge and tugboat units while the facility was closed 
for the year  the four units were primarily fully employed in the partnership s coal and rock trade 
interest expense the reduction in interest expense for compared with and reduction for compared with was attributable to lower debt levels during and lower interest rates on the company s variable rate debt 
in january  the company retired the remaining  of medium term notes  refinancing the notes through the company s bank revolving credit facility 
during  and  the average interest rate under the company s revolving credit facility was  and  respectively 
interest rate swap agreements totaling  executed in february and april to hedge a portion of its exposure to fluctuations in short term interest rates and more fully discussed in long term financing below  resulted in additional interest expense of  in and  in the average debt and average interest rates for  including the effect of interest rate swaps  were  and  compared with  and for and  and for  respectively 
financial condition  capital resources and liquidity balance sheet total assets as of december  were  compared with  as of december  and  as of december  the following table sets forth the significant components of the balance sheet as of december  compared with and compared with dollars in thousands change change to to assets current assets    property and equipment  net    investment in marine affiliates    goodwill  net    other assets    liabilities and stockholders equity current liabilities    long term debt less current portion    deferred income taxes    minority interests and other long term liabilities    stockholders equity    compared with current assets as of december  increased compared with december  prepaid expenses and other current assets increased  partially from the recording as a current asset  of a  november contribution to the company s defined benefit plan for vessel personnel 
the increased contribution was the result of lower interest rates and lower investment returns from the plan s assets  which consist primarily of fixed income securities and corporate stocks 
funding of the plan is based on actuarial projections that are designed to satisfy minimum erisa funding requirements to achieve adequate funding of accumulated benefit obligations 
additionally  vessels with a fair value of  and committed to be sold in  have been reclassified from property and equipment to prepaid expenses and other current assets 
the company also wrote off  of trade accounts receivables against the allowance for doubtful accounts primarily recorded in property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  as of december  increased compared with december  the increase reflected  of capital expenditures and the acquisition of tank barges and towboats totaling  more fully described under capital expenditures below  net of  of depreciation for the year and  of dispositions of marine equipment during the year

other assets as of december  increased during compared with december   primarily from the  contribution to the company s defined benefit plan for vessel personnel  of which  was classified as a current asset 
current liabilities as of december  declined compared with december   primarily due to a decrease in accrued liabilities  the result of lower employee compensation accruals  the timing of such compensation payments  and lower accrued interest expense the result of lower average interest rates and lower average debt levels  partially offset by higher accruals for casualty losses 
long term debt  less current portion  as of december  increased compared with december  the increase was impacted by borrowings to finance the first quarter cargo carriers acquisition  fourth quarter coastal and union carbide marine equipment acquisitions  the november  defined benefit plan contribution  the capital expenditures and common stock repurchases 
minority interests and other long term liabilities as of december  increased compared with december   primarily due to the recording of a  increase in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements for  more fully described under long term financing below 
stockholders equity as of december  increased compared with december  the increase for primarily reflected net earnings of  a net increase in treasury stock of  and a  decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the increase in treasury stock reflected  of open market treasury stock purchases less  associated with the exercise of employee stock options 
the  decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income resulted from the net changes in fair value of interest rate swap agreements  net of taxes  more fully described under long term financing below 
compared with in december  oceanic  the company s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  liquidated its remaining available for sale securities  which totaled  as of september  prior to  oceanic was used to insure risks of the company and its subsidiaries  which required oceanic to be more fully capitalized 
total current assets as of december  decreased compared with december  the decrease reflected a  reduction in cash and cash equivalents and a  or reduction in trade accounts receivables  even though marine transportation and diesel engine services revenues increased during by a combined over the reduction in trade accounts receivable reflected the company s emphasis on the collection of such receivables during the company also recorded a  allowance for doubtful accounts in the fourth quarter when a large houston based trading company filed for bankruptcy 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  remained relatively constant with december  the balance reflected two diesel engine services acquisitions in the fourth quarter and a final purchase price adjustment to the hollywood marine acquisition totaling approximately  to reflect the fair value of the property and equipment acquired in the transaction 
goodwill as of december  decreased compared with december  goodwill totaling  was recorded in  and adjusted in by an additional  for the hollywood marine acquisition  representing the excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities
