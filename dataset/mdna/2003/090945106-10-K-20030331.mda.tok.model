item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the matters discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including the extent to which our products and products under development are successfully developed and gain market acceptance  the impact of competition  including the introduction of products competitive with our triage bnp test  from diagnostic companies with greater capital and resources  manufacturing capacity constraints  backlog  delays or inefficiencies  regulatory changes  uncertainties or delays  changing market conditions and the other risk and uncertainties under risk factors and throughout this annual report on form k 
actual results may differ materially from those projected 
these forward looking statements represent our judgment as of the date of the filing of this form k 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update these forward looking statements 
overview founded in  biosite incorporated is a leading provider of novel  rapid medical diagnostics that improve a physician s ability to diagnose critical diseases and conditions 
we believe that improvements in diagnosis of high acuity diseases and conditions can positively impact medical decisions  improve the quality of patient care and contribute to cost effective medical treatment 
we focus on large  poorly met medical needs for clinical tests that diagnose acute symptoms associated with serious health problems 
our products are principally sold to hospitals  which number approximately  in the united states 
to market our products we utilize a clinically astute direct sales team that focuses its efforts on larger centers with more than beds 
the fisher healthcare division of the fisher scientific company  or fisher  distributes all of our products in us hospitals and supports our direct sales force  particularly in smaller hospitals 
the term of the fisher distribution agreement expires on december  and automatically renews for an additional two years unless a notice of non renewal is delivered by either company 
we are in discussion with fisher regarding options for a continued relationship 
sales to fisher represented and of our product sales in and  respectively 
fisher reported to us that end user sales of our products by fisher were million and million in  and  respectively 
fisher s end user sales are not directly comparable to our product sales because the timing of shipments from biosite to fisher may not match the timing of shipments from fisher to the end user hospitals and due to changes in the quantities of our products fisher purchases and stocks in its inventory 
a field based network of clinically experienced individuals supports the sales effort by providing pre and post sale education and training 
in international markets  we utilize a network of country specific and regional distributors  as well as a small direct sales force 
in  net revenues eclipsed million  representing growth of over the previous year 
this growth resulted largely from sales of our triage bnp test  which aids in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure  or chf 
sales of our triage bnp test represented and of our product sales in and  respectively 
the test  which was launched domestically in  was the first blood test available to aid in the detection of chf and has benefited from a semi exclusive position in the market 
we believe that the combination of innovation  medical relevance and semi exclusivity has contributed to the success of the triage bnp test and we seek to replicate this model for future products we hope to commercialize 
in  we launched biosite discovery  a program dedicated to the validation of targets with novel therapeutic and or diagnostic applications 
through biosite discovery  we leverage our expertise in phage display antibody development to access protein targets via internal research  licensing or collaborations with clinical institutions or commercial companies 
once promising targets are selected  we develop immunoassays for these targets and then conduct high throughput screening using patient samples procured from clinical collaborators  often leading medical institutions 
this process  which we refer to as marker mining  enables us to determine diagnostic utility and explore interrelations among multiple markers 
if the diagnostic utility of a marker or panel of markers is established  the marker or panel is then assessed for commercialization potential  with high value markers or panels added to our product development pipeline 
we have reported quarterly operating profits since the third quarter of  after incurring quarterly operating losses during the prior seven quarters 
our operating results may fluctuate on a quarterly or annual basis in the future and our growth or operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
we may not be able to maintain profitability in the future 
we believe that our future operating results will be subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  including market acceptance of current or new products changes in the mix of products sold the timing and variability of significant orders seasonal or unanticipated changes in customer demand manufacturing capacity constraints  delays or inefficiencies competition  including the introduction of products competitive with our triage bnp test  from diagnostic companies with greater financial capital and resources competitive pressures on average selling prices of our products regulatory changes  uncertainties or delays costs  timing and effectiveness of further expansion of our sales force and field support resources changes in reimbursement policies whether and when new products are successfully developed and introduced by us research and development efforts  including clinical trials and new product scale up activities ability to execute  enforce and maintain license and collaborative agreements necessary to earn contract revenues attainment of milestones under collaborative agreements necessary to earn contract revenues product recalls shipment problems enforcement  defense and resolution of license and patent disputes  and costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies 
operating results would also be adversely affected by a downturn in the market for our products 
because we continue to increase our operating expenses to support our expanded sales and marketing activities  manufacturing operations  biosite discovery and new product development  our operating results would be adversely affected if our sales and gross profits did not correspondingly increase or if our biosite discovery or product development efforts are unsuccessful or subject to delays 
our limited operating history makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we may not sustain revenue growth or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  and our growth or operating results may not be consistent with predictions made by securities analysts 
recent developments nonqualified stock incentive plan on november  the board of directors adopted the biosite incorporated nonqualified stock incentive plan  or stock plan 
our board of directors reserved  shares for issuance under the plan 
directors and officers are not eligible to participate in the plan 
our board of directors adopted the plan to accommodate our growth  which includes hiring a significant number of employees over the next nine months 
critical accounting policies involving management assumptions and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales upon shipment unless there are significant post delivery obligations or collection is not considered probable at the time of shipment 
generally  we do not have any significant post delivery obligations associated with our product sales 
we accrue for warranty costs and other allowances at the time of shipment based on historical experience  trends and estimates 
our collaborative development agreements generally contain specific payments for specific activities or elements of the agreements 
among the payments we might receive under the agreements are up front technology access fees  research funding  antibody development fees upon the delivery of antibodies  annual maintenance fees on targets for which biosite has produced antibodies for as long as the targets remain in development by our collaborators  milestone fees on drug targets that reach certain development milestones and royalties should products successfully be commercialized as a result of the collaboration 
up front technology access fees are recognized over the term of the agreement or ongoing research period  as applicable  unless the company has no further continuing performance obligations related to the fees 
research funding is recognized over the applicable research period on a straight line basis  which approximates the underlying performance 
milestone payments  such as antibody development fees and clinical milestones  are recognized when earned  as the milestone events are substantive and their achievability is not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement 
contract revenues that are based on the performance of and collection by our collaborators or their partners are deferred until such performance is complete and collection is probable 
we believe that each payment element of these agreements represents the fair value of the element at the date of the agreement 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 
 provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe that our revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and sab no 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
net inventories are valued at the lower of the first in  first out fifo cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
we utilize a standard cost system to track our inventories on a part by part  full absorption cost basis 
adjustments are made to the standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs on a fifo cost basis 
the estimated allowance for excess and obsolete inventories is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
intangible and other long lived assets 
at december   we had approximately million of long lived assets  including million of property  plant and equipment and million of capitalized license rights 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue directly or indirectly 
license rights related to products for sale are amortized to cost of sales over the life of the license  not to exceed ten years  using a systematic method based on the estimated revenues generated from products during the shorter of the license period or ten years from the inception of the license 
the estimated revenues used as the base by which we amortize the license rights only includes estimated sales for products we are currently selling and does not include any estimated product sales expected to be realized during the license amortization term from products still in development today 
our intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
deferred income taxes 
as of december   we have approximately million of deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of temporary differences between book and tax treatment 
no valuation allowance has been recorded to offset the deferred tax assets as we have determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of such assets  however  if future events occur which do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  we will record a valuation allowance against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
examples of future events that may occur which would make the realization of such assets not likely are a lack of taxable income resulting from poor operating results or rising tax deductions generated from disqualifying dispositions of stock issued under our stock plans 
results of operations years ended december  and product sales 
product sales by product family were as follows in thousands year ended december  product family cardiovascular products triage bnp test products triage cardiac panel products triage meterplus products other products triage drugs of abuse and tox drug screen products triage microbiology products total product sales product sales for increased to million from in the increase in total product sales was primarily attributable to the million growth in net sales of our triage bnp test  one of our cardiovascular diagnostic products 
due to the continued acceleration in customer demand for the triage bnp test  distributor inventory levels of some of our products were below targeted stocking levels at december  we are expanding our manufacturing capacity through added production shifts and through the implementation of additional automated manufacturing equipment 
product sales in future quarters will be impacted as we and our distributors attempt to adjust distributor inventories to targeted stocking levels and our effectiveness and efficiency in expanding our manufacturing capacity 
net sales of our cardiovascular products  consisting of our triage cardiac panel  triage bnp test and the triage meterplus  totaled million for  as compared to million for the net sales growth of our cardiovascular products of was primarily due to growth in sales volume of our triage bnp test 
the triage bnp test was launched in the us in december the triage bnp test is currently only one of two fda approved tests used as an aid in the diagnosis of congestive heart failure 
roche diagnostics received its fda clearance to market its competitive product in november abbott laboratories  bayer diagnostics and shionogyi co 
ltd have certain diagnostic rights to the bnp protein and we anticipate competition from these companies in the future 
scios  inc  the licensor of the bnp technology and patents is in the process of being acquired by johnson johnson  subject to certain conditions 
these competitors may succeed in developing or marketing products that are more effective or commercially attractive than the triage bnp test 
moreover  we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  distribution or support capabilities to compete successfully with these and other competitors in the future 
net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel  triage tox drug screen  triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel were approximately million for  as compared to million for the net sales decrease of these products was primarily due to a decrease in our average net selling prices that was partially offset by an increase in sales volume of these products 
we believe that the domestic sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel products may continue to decline as the available us market becomes saturated and competitive pressures become more prominent in a maturing market 
the triage tox drug screen was launched in the united states in february contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of revenues associated with our research and development and licensing arrangements  including license fees  milestone revenues  royalties  research funding and antibody fees 
contract revenues for were million  compared to million for contract revenues recognized during consisted primarily of license fees  research funding and antibody fees 
in june  we entered into an alliance with medarex inc under the terms of the agreement  we receive research funding of million per year over eight years from medarex  along with research fees and  if any products are generated through the collaboration  milestone payments and royalties 
we recognized  during each quarter of and of research funding from the alliance with medarex 
other contract revenues recognized during  and included license fees  antibody fees  and amortization of up front technology access fees 
the increase in contract revenues during  as compared to  resulted primarily from the grant of a non exclusive license from us to a company for certain proprietary technology 
biosite discovery activities are performed and its costs are incurred by certain of our research and development teams 
these biosite discovery research and development resources concurrently focus on programs for our collaborators  which generated our contract revenue  and on internal research and development programs 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million for  as compared to approximately million for these costs are included in research and development expenses 
cost of sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in gross profits increased primarily due to an overall increase in product sales 
the overall gross margin for was  compared to for the decrease in the overall gross margin primarily resulted from the changing mix of net sales of our products that have different gross margins and from manufacturing inefficiencies experienced as we attempt to increase our manufacturing capacity by adding production shifts and implementing semi automated and automated manufacturing equipment into the manufacturing processes 
our cardiovascular products have lower gross margins than our triage drugs of abuse panel 
sales of our cardiovascular products represented and of our product sales for and  respectively 
our newer products are expected to continue to realize lower gross margins than the triage drugs of abuse panel as manufacturing capacity and production efficiency issues are addressed 
although our gross profits may continue to grow  we expect that our overall gross margins may continue to decrease as a result of competitive pricing pressures and the changing mix of net sales of products with different gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the increases in sg a expenses was primarily associated with the addition of sales  clinical education and technical service resources  expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines  additional marketing activities relating to new products  increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations and higher performance based compensation  such as sales commissions and bonuses based on the company s financial performance 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs in to be higher than in  as we continue to increase our sales  clinical education and technical service resources 
a significant portion of the increase in sales and field support resources occurred during the latter half of the year and are expected to contribute to the growth we anticipate in we also expect to expand our overall operations  including sales and marketing program activities for our new products and administrative support functions and infrastructure 
the timing of such increased expenditures and their magnitude are primarily dependent on the commercial success and sales growth of our products 
research and development expenses r d expenses 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in during and  our research and development resources were focused primarily on new product development  the development of potential improvements to our existing products and manufacturing processes  and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
expenses related to the performance of our obligations associated with earning our contract revenues were incurred by our research and development group  primarily biosite discovery 
the increase in r d expenses during was primarily related to increased r d activities as well as increased performance based compensation resulting from the company s performance versus its beginning of the year goals 
we expect our research and development expenses for to be higher than in the increased expenditures will relate primarily to product development efforts  including the potential development of diagnostic products for cardiovascular profiling  stroke and acute coronary syndromes  clinical studies  biosite discovery  and new product scale up activities associated with potential new products 
the timing of the expenditures and their magnitudes depends primarily on the progress and success of research and development and the timing of potential product launches 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes incurred during totaled million  compared to million for no expenses associated with the xoma litigation were incurred prior to may the expenses consisted primarily of legal costs related to our litigation with xoma 
in september  we announced that we resolved all outstanding disputes regarding patent and licensing issues with xoma so as to permit each the freedom to operate its business 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income was million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities due to overall decline in interest rates  offset by the higher average balance of cash and marketable securities during compared to benefit provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax income and the estimated tax credits generated in  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for for  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million 
we will continue to assess the likelihood of realization of our tax credits and other net deferred tax assets 
if future events occur that do not make the realization of such assets more likely than not  a valuation allowance will be established against all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and product sales 
product sales increased to million in from million in the increase in product sales was primarily attributable to the growth in net sales of our cardiovascular diagnostic products  the triage cardiac panel and triage bnp test 
net sales of our meter platform products  consisting of the triage cardiac panel  triage bnp test and triage meterplus  were approximately million for  as compared to million for the triage cardiac panel s net sales growth was primarily due to growth in our customer base and to a lesser extent due to changes in the average net sales price 
the triage bnp test was launched in the united states in december net sales of triage drugs of abuse panel and triage micro panels consisting of the triage c 
difficile panel and triage parasite panel  were approximately million in  compared to million in the net sales growth for our qualitative platform products was primarily related to an increase in the average net sales prices for our triage drugs of abuse panel 
the impact of the increase in the average net sales price for our triage drugs of abuse panel was estimated to be million 
net sales of the triage drugs of abuse panel for were approximately million  as compared to million in contract revenues 
contract revenues consist of revenues associated with our research and development and licensing arrangements  including license fees  milestone revenues  royalties  research funding and antibody fees 
contract revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for contract revenues recognized during consisted primarily of research funding and antibody fees 
during and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of research funding from the alliance with medarex 
other contract revenues recognized during and included antibody fees  milestone payments and license fees 
costs of the research and development resources performing collaborative and internal biosite discovery activities were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  and are included in research and development expenses 
cost of sales and gross profit from product sales 
gross profit from product sales increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the overall product sales growth 
the overall gross margin from product sales increased to for from for the overall gross margin for increased primarily as a result of a greater manufacturing efficiency of our meter platform products  resulting primarily from larger production volumes  during as compared to sales of our meter platform products represented of our product sales in  compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in increases in sg a expenses were primarily associated with the expansion of our sales  clinical education and technical service resources  the expanded sales activities related to our broader product lines  additional marketing activities relating to new products and the increased administrative costs to support our expanded operations and business development activities 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in during  our research and development resources were focused primarily on new product development  the development of potential improvements to our existing products  and research activities associated with biosite discovery 
expenses related to the performance of our obligations associated with earning our contract revenues were incurred by our research and development group  primarily biosite discovery 
license and patent disputes 
expenses associated with license and patent disputes incurred during totaled million 
the expenses consisted primarily of legal costs related to our litigation with xoma 
no expenses associated with the xoma litigation were incurred prior to may interest and other income  net 
interest and other income increased  to million in from million in the increases resulted primarily from the higher average balance of cash and marketable securities during compared to additionally  in december  we decided to sell one of our marketable debt securities that had fallen below our investment guidelines 
the security was sold in january and resulted in a  realized loss  which was accrued at december  as a permanent decline in value of the security 
benefit provision for income taxes 
as a result of the pre tax income and the estimated tax credits generated in each year  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for and million for at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through cash from operations  private and public placements of equity securities  debt and capital lease financing  cash received under collaborative agreements and interest income 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million compared to million as of december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to cash generated from operating activities of million 
the primarily contributor to cash generated from operating activities was our net income for of million 
cash generated from operating activities also included increases in income taxes payable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities totaling approximately million and non cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization of million  offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
other sources of cash included the receipt of million in proceeds from equipment financing and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans of million 
significant uses of cash during included expenditures for leasehold improvements and capital equipment of million  principal payments under equipment financing debt arrangements of million and additional escrow deposits totaling  related to the purchase of land for our future corporate headquarters 
the increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during was largely attributable to cash generated from the operating activities of million  as compared to million during the cash generated from operating activities included the reduction of accounts receivable of million  tax benefit of disqualifying dispositions of million and a refund of income taxes paid of million 
other sources of cash included the receipt of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans  and the receipt of million in proceeds from equipment financing 
significant uses of cash during included the purchase of leasehold improvement and capital equipment of approximately million  principal payments under equipment financing obligations of million  and investments in patents  license rights  deposits  and other assets of million 
our primary short term needs for capital  which are subject to change  are for the support of our commercialization efforts related to our products  including expansion of our direct sales force and field support resources  improvements in our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  facility expansion  new product development  clinical trials  and the continued advancement of research and development efforts 
we executed agreements to license technologies patented by others that call for milestone payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we may enter into additional licensing agreements that may include up front and annual cash payments  milestone payments and future royalties based on product sales utilizing the licensed technologies 
we utilized and may continue to utilize credit arrangements with financial institutions to finance the purchase of capital equipment 
additionally  we may utilize cash generated from operating activities  if any  to meet our capital requirements 
we are also addressing our future facilities expansion needs 
we are currently in escrow to purchase approximately acres of land in san diego for the relocation of our corporate headquarters  which would be adequate for our foreseeable future needs 
the estimated purchase price of the land is million 
as of february  we had deposited million in escrow 
upon the close of escrow  expected to occur in the second quarter of  we intend to pursue financing for a portion of the land purchase price and the subsequent buildings construction costs through construction and long term debt financing 
the new headquarters will provide us with up to  square feet and will be constructed in phases as needed 
the first phase will provide us with approximately  square feet of space 
the total land and construction cost of the first phase is estimated to be approximately million 
we expect the first phase of construction to be completed in we may decide to seek additional capital to fund this new facility 
if a new corporate facility were to be constructed to meet our future facility needs  we would not anticipate expanding our operations to the new facility prior to expanding into a new facility would be expected to result in both cash expenditures  for the purchase of the land and construction costs  that would be reimbursed from loan proceeds if we are successful in obtaining financing  and an increase in occupancy costs 
we believe that our available cash  cash from operations and funds from existing credit arrangements will be sufficient to satisfy our funding needs for at least the next months  except for the potential funding requirement of a portion of the cost of our facility expansion plan 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit facilities 
we intend to pursue additional credit facilities to finance a portion of the land purchase price and the subsequent buildings construction costs 
additional capital  if needed  may not be available on satisfactory terms  if at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may include restrictive covenants 
our future liquidity and capital funding requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our new products and products under development are successfully developed  gain market acceptance and become and remain competitive the timing and variability of significant orders seasonal or unanticipated changes in customer demand regulatory changes  uncertainties or delays the costs  timing and effectiveness of further expansion of sales  marketing and manufacturing activities and resources  expansion of our manufacturing capacity and biosite discovery activities and our facilities expansion needs the ability to execute  enforce and maintain license and collaborative agreements and attain the milestones under these agreements necessary to earn contract revenues the timing and results of research and development efforts including clinical studies and regulatory actions regarding our potential products changes in third party reimbursement policies  and the costs and timing associated with business development activities  including potential licensing of technologies patented by others 
our failure to raise capital on acceptable terms  when needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily from our investments in available for sale marketable securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivatives instruments to manage this exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates 
additionally  our purchases of triage meterplus from lre technology partner gmbh  or lre  are denominated in euros and sales of some products to some international customers are denominated in the local currency of customers 
we have on occasion purchased forward exchange contracts to manage this exposure to exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
total receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies as of december  were not material
