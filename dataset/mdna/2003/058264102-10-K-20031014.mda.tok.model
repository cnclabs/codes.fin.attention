the decline in net sales in the second half of the fiscal year ended june  is primarily due to the global printing and publishing industry economic slowdown 
the decline in net sales in the second half of the fiscal year ended june  is primarily due to the global printing and publishing industry economic slowdown following the events of september   and the disposition of the rhg 
the decline in net sales in the second half of fiscal was primarily due to the lower sales to goss graphic systems  inc goss and lower sales volume in the japanese markets 
the following schedule shows the company s net sales for such six month periods  adjusted for the treatment of bka as a discontinued operation over the last five fiscal years to reflect the comparison 
first six second six fiscal year months months forward looking statements except for the historical information contained herein  the following statements and certain other statements contained herein are based on current expectations 
similarly  the press releases we issue and other public statements we make from time to time may contain language that is forward looking 
these forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words or phrases such as forecast  believe  expect  intend  anticipate  should  plan  estimate  and potential  among others 
such statements are forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the company cautions investors that any such forward looking statements made by the company are not guarantees of future performance and that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are set forth in exhibit to this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  critical accounting policies and estimates baldwin s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires baldwin to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  baldwin evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  asset impairments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
baldwin bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
baldwin believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
baldwin maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of baldwin s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
baldwin provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while baldwin engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  baldwin s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from baldwin s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
baldwin writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
baldwin records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
baldwin has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event baldwin were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should baldwin determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded through a charged to income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  baldwin recognizes reserves for contingencies when it becomes probable that such a contingency exists 
effective july   baldwin adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
accordingly  baldwin no longer amortizes goodwill but instead tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  at least annually  by determining the fair value of the reporting unit based on a discounted cash flow model  and comparing it with its book value 
if  during the annual impairment review  the book value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value  goodwill is written down to its implied fair value 
sfas requires management to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  as well as the fair value of the assets and liabilities of each reporting unit  other than goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined as the difference between the fair value of a reporting unit  taken as a whole  and the fair value of the assets and liabilities of such reporting unit 
other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an impairment review include  among others  a decrease in the market value of an asset  the asset s inability to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  a decision to change the manner in which an asset is used  a physical change to the asset or a change in business climate 
baldwin calculates estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  of the related operation and compares it to the carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based upon a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exits 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of a related reporting unit may require the company to record an impairment charge in the future
