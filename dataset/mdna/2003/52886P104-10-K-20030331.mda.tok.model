overview we design  develop and market high performance flash cards that we market as digital film as well as other flash based storage products for consumer markets that utilize portable media for the capture and retrieval of digital content 
to address the growing market for compact digital data and media storage solutions  we recently began selling our jumpdrive  a new  high speed portable usb flash drive for consumer applications that serves a variety of uses including floppy disk replacement 
we also market a variety of connectivity products that link our media products to pcs and other electronic devices 
our digital photography products enable customers to capture digital images and download them quickly to a personal computer for editing  distributing and printing 
we also license our proprietary controller technology and sell controllers to other manufactures of flash storage media to address markets adjacent to digital photography 
our digital film products enable customers to capture digital images and download them quickly to a personal computer for editing  distributing and printing 
flash card sales comprised of our gross revenues for we offer flash cards in the five primary media formats currently used by digital cameras and other electronic devices compactflash  memory stick  smartmedia  secure digital card and multimedia card 
we also recently began selling the xd picture card  which is currently marketed and sold only as digital film  although it may in the future be marketed for use in other electronic devices  as well as the memory stick pro  which is gradually being incorporated in devices offered by sony 
of those seven formats  we currently manufacture compactflash and memory stick  and we plan to expand to additional formats in in both cases  we combine flash memory from leading suppliers with our patented controller technology 
a controller determines  among other things  the manner in which data is written to and read from the flash memory and is important in determining the overall performance of the flash card 
we believe our high performance compactflash can record data faster than other compactflash cards 
this performance advantage is particularly noticeable when used in advanced digital cameras that take advantage of our digital film s write speed  or the rate at which our digital film can capture a digital image 
our digital film is compatible with substantially all digital cameras  including those manufactured by agfa  canon  casio  epson  fuji  hewlett packard  kodak  konica  minolta  nikon  olympus  polaroid  ricoh  sony and yashica 
jumpdrive was introduced and began generating revenue in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we announced a new jumpdrive product called jumpdrive pro 
jumpdrive pro incorporates our high speed controller technology and is the only product in the industry that is certified by the usb integrator s forum for usb speeds 
this product operates at x speed  which means it is capable of megabytes a second sustained transfer speeds 
jumpdrive pro is available in capacities up to megabytes 
we also recently introduced jumpdrive trio 
this product can connect a user s memory stick  secure digital card or multimedia card directly to a usb port 
we intend to continue to expand our jumpdrive product line in the upcoming year 
our digital media reader writers are products that facilitate the transfer of digital images to personal computers and other devices without a direct connection to the digital camera 
our jumpshot cable connects the universal serial bus  or usb  port to our usb enabled compactflash digital film to quickly and easily transfer images 
our flash memory controller technology can be applied to a variety of consumer electronic applications such as digital music players  laptop computers  personal digital assistants  telecommunication and network devices and digital video recorders 
in order to extend our technology into these markets we have selectively licensed our products and technology to third parties 
these third parties have recently begun to integrate our high performance controller into their business sectors such as data communications  telecommunications  industrial  computing and embedded markets 
in march  we terminated our prior license agreement with samsung and executed a new license agreement that renewed and extended the prior license 
under this new agreement  samsung prepaid fixed royalties due under the prior license agreement at a discount rate 
samsung also paid additional licensing fees for expanded rights to license our technology 
the license payments are fixed through the first eight quarters of the agreement and become variable thereafter 
whether we will be paid any royalties under the variable royalty obligations depends on a number of factors  including which flash products samsung manufactures and sells and in what volumes  as well as our relative market shares and our aggregate purchases from samsung 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will be paid any amounts in variable royalties 
either party can terminate the agreement in the event of the other party s breach of the agreement or bankruptcy 
revenues 
we generate revenues primarily from the sale of digital film  other flash based storage products  and connectivity products to end users through mass market  photo and oem channels 
during  we significantly increased our presence in the mass market channel by significantly increasing the number of retail storefronts in which our products are sold by our customers 
our products were sold in approximately  retail stores worldwide at the end of  which represented an increase of more than  storefronts from the end of we also generate revenues from the sales of our controllers to flash storage manufacturers 
as is common practice in the mass market channel  we offer our customers various programs and incentive offerings  including price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts 
we sell our products to certain customers on a consignment basis 
as a result  our inventory balance at the end of the year included amounts for consigned inventory 
carrying higher levels of consigned inventory may result in additional operational costs 
to date  additional operating costs associated with our consigned inventories have not been significant 
we generate license revenues under license agreements  primarily with samsung and olympus 
a majority of our sales have been to a limited number of customers 
our top customers accounted for of our gross revenues in  in and in we expect that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues for at least the next several years 
domestic product sales account for the majority of our total net revenues 
net product revenues in the united states represented  and of our total net revenues in  and cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues consists primarily of materials costs  with flash memory accounting for a majority of those costs 
we maintain relationships with key suppliers  which we believe will be able to provide us with sufficient quantities of flash memory for at least the next months 
we have an agreement with samsung electronics  co  ltd 
under which it has become our primary supplier of flash memory and has guaranteed that we will have access to a portion of its available production capacity 
the price we have historically paid for flash memory has fluctuated considerably 
for example  the price of flash memory decreased significantly in and decreased more moderately in we expect that there will be significant price declines during as additional flash memory capacity becomes available 
in addition  cost of product revenues includes expenses related to materials procurement  inventory management  adjustments and manufacturing 
research and development 
our research and development expenses include salaries and related expenses for research and development personnel  fees for outside consultants  patent costs and prototype development and materials costs 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is important to enable us to attain our strategic objectives and we therefore expect research and development expenses to increase during sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses include salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  advertising  customer service  technical support  distribution and travel and trade show expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to vary during primarily in conjunction with changes in sales volumes throughout the year 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses include salaries and related expenses for executive  administrative and operational personnel  fees for professional services and other corporate expenses 
during  we expect to increase our efforts to license our technology to those companies that we believe infringe our intellectual property 
we expect that this will result in increased legal expenses 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation related to options granted to employees represents the aggregate difference  at the date of grant  between the deemed fair market value of the stock underlying options and the exercise prices of these options 
stock based compensation related to options granted to consultants is revalued as it vests using the black scholes option pricing model 
stock based compensation is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options based on an accelerated vesting method 
at december   unearned stock based compensation was million 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to price protection  customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under 
table of contents the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including price protection  rebates and customer programs  valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  including sales returns and other allowances  the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax valuation allowances and inventory write downs 
revenue recognition product revenues we derive our revenues primarily from products  which include flash memory products  controllers and connectivity products 
as discussed below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
we sell products to distributors  retailers  oems and end users 
certain customers have return rights 
we generally recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recorded  we record estimated reductions to product revenue based upon our historical experience related to product returns  customer price protection programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
in order to make such estimates we analyze historical returns  current economic conditions  customer demand and any relevant specific customer information 
for certain customers where we are unable to reasonably estimate the level of returns or other revenue allowances  revenues and the costs of revenues are deferred until these customers have sold the product to their customers 
should our ability to estimate  based on these various factors  change  this could have a significant impact on our revenue recognition  potentially reducing revenue in the period of such change 
license and royalty revenues when we have a signed license agreement  the technology has been delivered  there are no remaining significant obligations under the contract  the fee is fixed or determinable and non refundable and collectibility is reasonably assured  we recognize license fees and fixed non refundable royalties ratably over the term of the license or fixed royalty arrangement during which the customer has rights to the technology 
when royalties are based on the volume of products sold that incorporate our technology  revenue is recognized when earned 
variable royalties based on volume have been insignificant to date 
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities inventory write downs we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than we anticipate  for example  if product sales and prices decline more substantially than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax valuation allowance as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes  which involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences have resulted in net deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and we currently provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in the event we were to determine it is more likely than not that we are able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
other valuation allowances and accrued liabilities 
table of contents we also maintain accruals and allowances for price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts 
we incurred sales related discounts of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december  and  we had accruals and allowances of and million  respectively 
price protection  market development funds and cooperative marketing programs  rebates and other discounts are provided for at the time the associated revenue is recognized 
if market conditions were to change adversely  we may take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in increased accruals and allowances for these programs 
historically  warranty expenses have not been material 
in the unlikely event that a problem is identified that would result in the need to replace product on a large scale  such an event may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our history of losses from inception through december   we incurred substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million and cash from operating activities of million 
in december  we raised net proceeds of million from a public offering 
we believe that our cash resources of million  at december   together with anticipated revenues from our operations and funds available under our bank and vendor credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our operating activities throughout the next twelve months at our current operating levels 
results of operations in view of the rapidly changing nature of our market and our operating history  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and other operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
our historic revenue growth rates are not necessarily indicative of our future growth 
the following table sets forth our statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues product revenues license and royalty revenues total net revenues cost of product revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation goodwill impairment restructuring charge credit settlement of litigation total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest and other expense interest and other income foreign exchange gain loss total other income expense income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss 
table of contents year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues total net revenues for increased approximately million  or  to million from million for during  gross revenues from two customers  walmart and wynit  each represented greater than of our gross revenue product revenues comprised and of total revenues for and  respectively 
increased sales of our products in the retail channel was a major factor in the significant growth in our product revenues in increased sales into the retail market introduced an element of seasonality to our business that we had not experienced previously 
for example  retail sales were very strong in the fourth quarter of due to seasonal consumer demand during the holidays 
product revenues for increased approximately million  or  to million from million in the increase in product revenues was attributable to a increase in units shipped due to significantly increased demand in the oem and retail channels 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in our average selling price per megabyte 
in  we derived  and of our product revenues from sales to customers in the united states  europe and japan  respectively 
in  we derived  and of our product revenues from sales to customers in the united states  europe and japan  respectively 
we anticipate that our revenues will increase in we generate license and royalty revenues from agreements under which we license the use of our patented controller technology 
our license and royalty revenues  which comprised and of net revenues in and  respectively  increased to million in from million in the increase in license and royalty revenues was primarily the result of the license and royalty agreements that we entered into during the second quarter of and the first quarter of we will continue to seek new licensing opportunities in  and expect our license and royalty revenues to increase in we sell our controllers as a stand alone product to flash card manufacturers and license this technology to original equipment manufacturers  or oems 
controller revenue for increased million  or  to million during  compared to million for cost of product revenues cost of product revenues increased to million for from million for the increase in cost of product revenues was primarily the result of both a increase in the number of units shipped and a increase in the average capacity of flash card products sold 
these factors were partially offset by a decline in the cost per megabyte of flash memory compared to the cost in  and the benefits of improved inventory control and turnover compared to gross margin gross margin for product revenues in increased to  as compared to a negative product gross margin of in this improvement was primarily the result of the decline in the cost per megabyte of flash memory  reductions in price protection charges from million  or to of gross product revenue  in to million or of gross product revenue in  and improved inventory control and turnover 
implementation of eitf and eitf resulted in classification of certain revenue reductions that negatively impacted product margins in by approximately percentage points 
we generally have higher gross margins on products we manufacture compared with products we purchase 
products we purchase are becoming a larger part of our revenues 
research and development for the year  research and development expenses decreased to million  or of total net revenues  from million  or of total net revenues  for the year the decrease in research and development expenses for compared to was primarily due to the disposition of printroom 
com resulting in a reduction approximately million in costs 
this decrease was offset by increases in compensation related costs due to increased headcount of approximately million 
the increase in our total net revenues accounted for approximately of the reduction in research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues for as compared to and the decrease in expenditures related to printroom 
com accounted for the remainder of the reduction 
we expect research and development costs to increase in due to the increased headcount and product development costs 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for decreased to million  or of total net revenues  as compared to million  or of total net revenues  for the decrease in sales and marketing expenses for compared to was primarily attributable to overall cost reductions during which resulted in a million reduction in advertising  tradeshow and market development costs and a million reduction in employee compensation costs as a result of the restructuring we implemented in the second quarter of the reduction in advertising and tradeshow costs resulted primarily from cost control measures 
the decrease in market development costs was a result of certain costs being classified as revenue reductions in these decreases were partially offset by increases in expenses that vary directly with sales  such as a million increase in commissions and a million increase in freight and order fulfillment costs 
the decrease in actual expenditures accounted for approximately of the reduction in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenues as compared to  and the increase in revenues accounted for the remaining of the reduction 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses for decreased to million  or of total net revenues  as compared to million  or of total net revenues  for the decrease in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due a million reduction in employee compensation related costs due to the restructuring that we implemented in the second quarter of as well as greater cost control in the decrease in actual expenditures accounted for approximately of the reduction in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues for as compared to  and the increase in our total net revenues accounted for the remaining approximate of the reduction 
as we incur increased professional legal fees as part of our ongoing expanded efforts to protect our intellectual property  we expect that general and administrative expenses could increase 
if additional litigation were filed against us  we expect that professional legal fees could increase our general and administrative expenses significantly beyond our current expectations 
stock based compensation the stock compensation expense for declined to million from million in this decrease resulted primarily from reporting stock compensation expense under the accelerated vesting method in accordance with fin goodwill impairment during the first quarter of  we recognized a charge of million  or of revenues for the year  for printroom 
com goodwill 
at the end of the second quarter of fiscal  our management decided to dispose of the printroom 
com operation 
we successfully completed the disposition during the third quarter of restructuring during the third quarter of  we implemented a reduction in our work force and discontinued our printroom 
com operations 
we recognized a million charge related to this restructuring 
the disposition of printroom 
com was implemented through a sale of the printroom 
com assets to a company owned by the management of printroom 
com who are continuing its operations 
we recorded a note receivable of million in connection with the transaction and have fully reserved it 
during we reversed approximately million of the restructuring accrual that was established in the second quarter of as we settled certain obligations that resulted from the restructuring at a lower cost than originally anticipated 
as a result of the restructuring activities  we expected to achieve annual reductions in payroll and payroll related costs of approximately million  of which approximately million related to printroom operations 
in addition  we expected to eliminate the other operating expenses related to printroom  primarily rent expense of approximately million per year 
the actual savings in were consistent with amounts initially anticipated 
a summary of the activity in the restructuring reserve is outlined as follows in thousands accrued balance at june  cash payments non cash charges accrued balance at december  reduction in workforce asset write offs and other excess facilities and related costs 
table of contents accrued balance at december  cash payments non cash charges adjustment accrued balance at december  reduction in workforce asset write offs and other excess facilities and related costs we expect to pay amounts related to excess facilities and related costs over the terms of the related leases through other income and expense interest and other expense decreased to million in from million in interest and other expense for consisted primarily of interest on short term borrowings 
interest and other expense for included imputed and other non cash interest charges of million  associated primarily with the amortization of the value of the warrants issued and fees paid in connection with our credit facilities with the chase manhattan bank and access technology partners  the write off of the remaining balances related to fees on the chase loan that was repaid and the write off of the warrants issued to chase 
interest and other income for was million compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates in the net foreign exchange gain reported in was million compared to a net loss of million reported in these amounts were primarily attributable to european and japanese sales activities and fluctuations in the british pound and the japanese yen against the us dollar in each of the periods 
our net foreign exchange losses on hedging transactions were million for we did not enter into any hedging transactions in income taxes income tax expense for was million  or of total net revenues  compared to income tax expense for of million  or of total net revenues 
income tax expense for includes million representing foreign taxes withheld from a license prepayment received from samsung and million in california state income taxes  which resulted primarily from the state of california s decision during the third quarter of to retroactively suspend the state income tax net operating loss deduction for a two year period 
income tax expense for primarily related to foreign taxes on foreign license revenues 
withholding taxes are recoverable only as a credit against federal income taxes 
due to the uncertainty of the recoverability  the withholding taxes have been reflected as income tax expense 
at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and federal research credits and foreign tax credits of approximately million and million  respectively  to offset future federal taxes 
the federal operating loss and research credit carryforwards will begin to expire in if not utilized 
based upon current tax law  the california operating loss carryforwards can begin to be utilized for tax years beginning december  the california operating losses begin to expire in we have established a valuation allowance since it is more likely than not that no benefit will be realized for our deferred tax assets 
sales of our stock  including shares sold in our public offerings  may further restrict our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards  and credits may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss carry forwards and credits before utilization 
year ended december  versus year ended december  revenues total net revenues for decreased by million  or  to million from million for product revenues comprised and of our net revenues in and  respectively 
the decrease in our product revenues by million  or  in as compared to  was the result of a decline in domestic oem revenues of million or  an approximately decline in our average selling prices  which was partially offset by an approximately increase in units shipped 
the decline in oem product sales was driven by our strategy to focus on selling higher margin products  licensing our proprietary controller technology and growing our presence in the retail channel 
the decline in average selling prices was due to declining flash memory costs and increased price competition

license and royalty revenues comprised and of our net revenues in and  respectively 
licensing and royalty revenues in increased by million  or  to million from million in cost of product revenues cost of revenues for decreased million  or  to million from million for this decrease was primarily driven by an approximate decline in the cost per megabyte of flash memory as a result of declines in flash memory pricing and a decrease in assembly costs 
these decreases were partially offset by an approximate increase in the average capacity of flash card products sold and by a million charge related to excess and obsolete inventory 
gross margin cost of revenues  as a percentage of net revenues  for increased to from for our gross margins decreased due to a number of factors  including a decline in average selling prices  significant increases in rebates and increases in price protection of channel inventories due to price competition which resulted in charges of approximately million  or approximately of gross product revenues 
in conjunction with our decreased sales these factors severely impacted our gross margin during the first half of  resulting in negative gross margin for the first two quarters of our gross margins significantly improved during the second half of the year as a result of lower costs  increased revenues from our higher margin products and a shift away from our lower margin oem business research and development research and development expenses for decreased million  or  to million from million for the decrease in research and development expenses was due  in part  to the disposition of printroom

this decrease was primarily due to the timing of inventory receipts during the fourth quarter of the increase in prepaid expenses and other assets used million in cash 
these uses were partially offset by cash provided from changes in accrued liabilities of million  accounts receivable of million and deferred license and product margin of million 
the increase in accrued liabilities was primarily the result of a million increase in price protection due to an increased rate of price protection in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year and a million increase in the market development fund due to increased sales in compared to the prior year 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   which was the result of purchases of property and equipment and patents 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for year ended december   which primarily represented proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million in the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities in was primarily attributable to the purchase of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   which was primarily the result of raising million in december through the public sale of approximately million shares of our common stock  debt proceeds of million which were primarily from our asset based credit facility with greater bay bank  and net proceeds from equity transactions of million  offset by debt repayments of million primarily against our asset based credit facility with greater bay bank and the million increase in restricted cash 
restricted cash represents cash and cash equivalents used to collateralize standby letters of credit related to purchasing agreements with our suppliers 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  during  we repaid all of our outstanding debt in the amount of million under our credit facilities with the chase manhattan bank and access technology partners and we repaid million of other debt 
in september  we established an asset based credit facility with greater bay bank 
at december   the balance outstanding under this facility was approximately million 
under an agreement with a financial institution  we also have the ability to factor certain yen denominated receivables and the balance factored at december  was approximately million 
in december  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share in a public offering underwritten by sg cowen securities corporation  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
the offering was effected by means of a universal shelf registration statement that we had previously filed with the securities and exchange commission 
from inception through december   we incurred substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million and cash from operating activities of million 
we believe that our cash resources of million  at december   together with anticipated revenues from our operations and funds available under our bank and vendor credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our operating activities throughout the next twelve months at our current operating levels

table of contents recent accounting developments in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf no 
addresses the accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer and is a codification of eitf no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  eitf no 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  and eitf no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products 
our gross margins for the year ended december  reflect the implementation of eitf and eitf the impact of these pronouncements is that consideration generally given by us to a customer is presumed to be a reduction of selling price  and therefore  a reduction of revenue 
however  if we receive an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration given to our customer that is sufficiently separable from our sales to that customer  such that we could have paid an independent company to receive that benefit  and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit  then the consideration is characterized as an expense 
the effect of these changes was a reduction in our product gross margins in the year ended december  from to 
there was no impact on our income before income taxes or our net income for the year 
we determined that it was impracticable to gather the data required to compute the impact of these consensuses on the years ended december  and had they been in place at that time 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and early application is encouraged 
the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas the effect on adoption of sfas will change  on a prospective basis  the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when the liability is incurred 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
generally the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we anticipate that it will continue to follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we provide warranties that range from one year for card readers to limited lifetime warranties for our professional products 
warranty costs are the costs to rework or scrap returned inventories 
we have historically experienced minimal warranty costs 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or 
table of contents performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing the impact of eitf issue no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
risks that could affect future results the factors discussed below are cautionary statements that identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business our operating results and gross margins may fluctuate significantly in the future and are difficult to predict 
if our future results are below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock could decline significantly 
our operating results and gross margins may vary significantly in the future based on a number of factors related to our industry and the markets for our products 
we will have little or no control over many of these factors and any of these factors could cause our operating results and gross margins  and consequently the price of our common stock  to fluctuate significantly 
these factors include  among others competitive pricing pressures  the rate of growth of the market for digital cameras and digital film  fluctuation in demand for our products  including seasonal demand for our products and the volume and timing of potential retail customer and distributor orders  the amount of price protection  volume incentive rebates  discounts  market development funds  cooperative advertising payments and other concessions and discounts that we may need to provide to some of our customers due to competitive pricing pressures  our ability to estimate revenue reserves for product sales to certain customers  the timing and amount of expenses related to obsolescence and disposal of excess inventory and the difficulty of forecasting and managing our inventory levels  the timing and amount of any reductions in the average selling prices of our products and services  the difficulty of forecasting sell through rates of our products and their impact on inventory levels at our distributors and customers  which may result in additional orders being delayed or reduced and inventory being returned  price reductions in key components  such as flash memory  could result in reduced margins when selling products that include previously purchased components held in inventory  increases in costs charged by our component or card suppliers or the failure of our suppliers to decrease the prices they charge to us when industry prices decline  the availability and pricing of flash memory  particularly high performance flash memory with increased memory capacity  the timing and amount of orders and cancellations from existing and new customers  the announcement or introduction of products and technologies by competitors  the timing and manner of revenue recognition for any given customer  including the deferral of revenue from new customers until the product is sold to their customers or changes in our ability to estimate appropriate reductions in product revenue based upon historical experience which may lead to the deferral of revenue until product is sold to their customers  any lessening or decline in the trend of sequential increases of the capacity per unit sold of digital storage media  competing flash card standards  which displace the standards used in our products  
table of contents availability of sufficient silicon wafer foundry capacity to meet customer demand  shortages of components such as capacitors and printed circuit boards required for the manufacturing of our products  exchange rate fluctuations  particularly the us dollar to japanese yen exchange rate  the mix of business between retail  oem and licensing  commencement of or involvement in litigation  potential product quality problems which could raise return or rework costs  and whether we can sell controllers in the volumes and at the prices we anticipate 
in addition  as a result of the emerging nature of our market  we may be unable to accurately forecast our revenues and gross margins 
we incur expenses based predominantly on operating plans and estimates of future revenues 
our expenses are to a large extent fixed and we may not be able to adjust them quickly to meet a shortfall in revenues during any particular quarter 
we also plan inventory levels based on anticipated revenues 
any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses and planned inventories would decrease our net income or increase our operating losses and would also harm our financial condition 
declines in our operating results or gross margins may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts 
if this were to happen  the market price for our common stock would likely decline significantly 
we primarily depend upon samsung for our flash memory  and if samsung is unable to provide us with sufficient quantities of flash memory in a timely manner and remain technologically competitive and competitive on its price and sales terms  or if samsung were to reduce or eliminate our credit terms  we would not be able to manufacture and deliver digital film to our customers in accordance with their volume  price and schedule requirements  or we would have to seek alternate suppliers or additional financing 
as a result of the supply agreement we entered into with samsung in april  it has become our primary supplier of flash memory  which is the primary cost of our digital film 
we expect that the demand for flash memory over the next several years will be substantially greater than in past periods due to the increasing acceptance of digital cameras and other digital consumer products 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of flash memory from samsung or  if necessary  from another flash memory supplier in a timely manner and at competitive prices  we would not be able to manufacture and deliver flash memory products to satisfy our customers requirements 
in addition  if samsung does not offer us prices  sales terms and credit terms that are sufficient to meet our growing needs  we might have to seek alternate suppliers or additional financing 
furthermore  if samsung is unable to ensure that its flash memory is technologically and price competitive or has any interruptions in shipment for any reason  we may also be unable to satisfy our customers requirements 
for example  samsung is emphasizing smaller flash geometries over multi level cell technology 
if multi level cell technology can be manufactured in volume at high yields  it could offer significant cost advantages over single level cell technologies 
if we are unable to satisfy the requirements of our customers  they may reduce any future orders or eliminate us as a supplier 
our reputation would likely also be harmed and we may not be able to replace any lost business with new customers 
because we will likely obtain most of our flash memory from samsung for the foreseeable future  our relationships with other flash suppliers may not be as strong as they had been in the past 
other flash suppliers may not be able to supply our flash memory needs if we cannot obtain adequate supplies from samsung 
even if we are able to obtain flash memory in sufficient volume and on schedules that permit us to satisfy our delivery requirements  we cannot assure you that the prices charged by these suppliers will enable us to compete effectively in our market 
samsung and many other potential suppliers of flash memory are located in asia  a region that has been  and in the future may be  affected by economic and political instability that could adversely affect the price and supply of flash memory 
if we are unable to obtain flash memory at economical prices  our margins would decline unless we could raise the prices of our products in a commensurate manner 
the existing competitive conditions may not permit us to do so  which would adversely impact our revenues and gross margin 
the solid state storage market is evolving and future digital film formats may not use our core technology or we may be forced to pay a royalty to sell digital film in these formats our products may become less useful to our customers if we are unable to respond to technological advances in our industry or as innovative products become available to our customers 
many new digital cameras and other consumer devices now use emerging flash memory formats such as the secure digital card or the xd picture card formats  which we do not currently manufacture and do not have rights to manufacture the secure digital card  for example  was introduced by a consortium consisting of sandisk  matsushita and toshiba 
the consortium charges license fees to other companies that want to manufacture this product 
these flash memory formats have rapidly gained broad consumer acceptance 
continued rapid adoption of these products will likely result in a decline in demand  relative to other products for products that we manufacture  such as compactflash 
we may be unable to secure licensing arrangements that give us the right to manufacture these new or other future 
table of contents formats at reasonable rates or at all 
we currently source such products from third parties 
if we are not able to supply all flash card formats at competitive prices or if we were to have product shortages  our customers would likely cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us 
matrix semiconductor has announced that it soon plans to introduce a one time programmable memory with significant cost savings over the types of memory that are currently commercially available 
if we are unable to obtain such technology at competitive prices  our business may be adversely affected 
further  future digital cameras may use other digital film formats  such as compact discs  rotating media  micro optical storage or magneto optical storage  which may not use our controller technology 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future capital needs  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products  expand our operations or respond to competitive pressures 
we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents as of december  we currently anticipate that this amount  together with funds available under our bank and vendor credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through the next months at our current operating levels 
however  it is likely that we would need to raise additional funds prior to the expiration of this period to fund additional growth if we do not realize our expectation of continued operating income and incur operating losses that deplete our working capital  or if we are unable to maintain our existing credit facilities  including credit extended to us from our suppliers 
if we were required to raise additional funds  it could be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing shares of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  or warrants or otherwise  which could dilute our existing stockholders 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to maintain our product development schedule  respond to competitive pressures or grow our business 
increased competition in the digital film market may lead to a decrease in our revenues and market share 
we currently compete in an industry characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  declining average selling prices and rapid product obsolescence 
our existing competitors include many large domestic and international companies that have longer operating histories and greater brand name recognition  greater access to flash memory  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with retailers  oems and end users 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better absorb price declines  adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than we may 
ultimately  this may lead to a decrease in our sales and market share 
our primary competitors are companies that sell flash media into the mass market  photo and oem channels 
many of these companies are manufacturers with both controller and flash memory capabilities  such as hitachi  micron  samsung  sandisk and toshiba 
samsung has recently begun to sell flash cards in larger volumes to third parties  including to our competitors 
hitachi has recently made several announcements that suggest that it has increased its commitment to flash memory 
sandisk and toshiba jointly develop and manufacture high performance flash memory 
because flash memory represents a significant portion of the cost of digital film  sandisk may have a competitive advantage in that it has access to high capacity flash memory at prices that may be substantially below the prices that samsung will charge 
we also face significant competition from manufacturers or card assemblers and resellers that either resell flash cards purchased from others or assemble cards from controllers and flash memory chips purchased from companies such as hitachi or toshiba  into flash cards 
these companies  include crucial  dane elec  delkin devices  eastman kodak  feiya corporation  fuji  hagiwara  hewlett packard  i o data  infineon  kingston technology  m systems  matsushita  memorex  memory plus  micron  pny  pretec  pqi  ritek  samsung  silicon storage technology  silicon tek  simple technology  smart modular technologies  sony  tdk  transcend  viking components and many others 
an increasing number of companies are manufacturing their own controllers  including ktc  sandisk  silicon storage technologies sst  solid state system co 
ltd 
s  and a number of other taiwanese companies 
such companies either combine their controller with flash memory from third parties to manufacture their own flash cards or sell their controllers to third parties who use them to assemble flash cards 
additionally  major semiconductor companies such as infineon  hitachi  samsung and toshiba have also developed or are currently developing their own controllers that will likely compete with our controller and card sales 
many companies have introduced usb drives that compete directly with our jumpdrive line of products 
these include apacer  belkin  iomega  jm tek  m systems  netac  pendrive  samsung  sandisk  simple  trek and over many others 
our competitors have also introduced additional flash card formats 
for example  a consortium consisting of sandisk  matsushita and toshiba have developed the secure digital card  a media format used in digital cameras as well as in other 
table of contents electronic applications and fuji and olympus have introduced the xd picture card 
we do not currently manufacture these new flash memory products  and we may not be able to do so in the future at a reasonable rate or at all 
if we are unable to obtain the rights to manufacture these products  our business will be adversely affected 
kodak and fuji are the largest and best known manufacturers of traditional film products 
kodak and fuji have entered the us digital film market  but do not yet manufacture their own digital film 
kodak has also announced that it plans to build on its digital strategy with investments and purchases as it aims to be the number one player in digital photography 
it further stated that it would fund its digital plans from billion in free cash flow between and with their resources and worldwide brand recognition  either kodak or fuji would be formidable competitors for our core business 
several companies have introduced competing technologies for use in digital cameras 
these include products such as ibm s microdrive 
although the cost per megabyte of rotating media such as the microdrive is lower than that of flash cards  rotating media has higher power consumption and lower reliability than flash cards 
compact discs can also be used as a storage medium for digital cameras and other devices  and  while inexpensive  are quite bulky 
we expect to continue to face competition from existing or future competitors that design and market similar or alternative data storage solutions that may be less costly or provide additional features 
if a manufacturer of digital cameras or other consumer electronic devices designs one of these alternative competing standards into its products  the digital film we manufacture  as currently configured  will not be compatible with that product and our revenues may decline 
we have a history of losses and may not be able to sustain profitability 
we reported net income of approximately million for the twelve months ended december   and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
although we achieved profitability in the year ended december   we cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain profitability in future periods  and we will continue to use cash for operations 
our ability to sustain profitability depends on the rate of price decreases for our products  the growth of the markets for digital cameras  digital film and digital storage media  the extent to which our products  particularly our higher margin products  are accepted by these markets  our ability to charge a premium for our higher performance products and our ability to adequately control our operating expenses  particularly our litigation costs 
we also must continue to reduce the costs of producing and selling our digital film products by controlling our internal and channel inventory  securing the best available pricing for flash cards and components used in our digital film products and reducing our manufacturing costs 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing revenues from our higher margin products and controlling our operating expenses  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or an annual basis 
we market our digital film primarily on the basis of its superior technology 
if we are unable to achieve or maintain technology leadership  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline significantly 
we market our digital film primarily on the basis of its performance and technology advantage over our competitors products 
in doing so  we have emphasized our speed advantage over our competitors products and have tried to establish ourselves as the brand of choice among professional photographers 
we label our compactflash products for write speed performance in which x is equal to a write speed of kilobytes per second  nomenclature similar to that used in the cd rom industry 
for example  our x compactflash digital film is capable of sustained write speeds of at least kilobytes per second 
currently  we offer compactflash with write speeds ranging from x to x 
our highest capacity card is currently gigabyte 
from time to time our competitors have introduced products for which they have claimed high  sustained write speeds 
if we are unable to design and manufacture products that are technologically superior to those of our competitors or if we lose our status as a brand preferred by professional photographers  we will be unable to achieve a premium price for our products 
if this were to occur  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline significantly 
our products are characterized by average selling prices that have historically declined over relatively short time periods 
if we are unable to effectively manage our inventories  reduce our costs  introduce new products with higher average selling prices or increase our sales volumes  our revenues and gross margins will be negatively impacted 
although consumers have recently begun to purchase digital cameras in volume  they still exert pressure on digital camera manufacturers and on us to lower prices of digital photography products  like our digital film  to prices comparable to those of traditional photography products 
our competitors also impose pricing pressures on us 
often theses pricing pressures are the result of reduced flash memory costs 
in addition  because a large percentage of our sales are to a small number of customers that are primarily retail consumer chains  distributors and large oems  these customers have exerted  and we expect they will continue to exert  pressure on us to make price concessions 
in  and in  we significantly reduced the prices of many of our flash products  and may need to do so in the future to remain competitive 
any reduction in prices by us will negatively impact our gross margins unless we can manage our internal and channel inventories to minimize the impact of such price declines and reduce our costs 
we have also begun to sell our products to certain customers on a consignment basis  resulting in higher inventory levels 

table of contents if we are unable to reduce our costs to offset declines in average selling prices or increase the sales volume of our existing products  our revenues and gross margins will be adversely affected 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will decline significantly as additional flash memory capacity becomes available throughout this may negatively impact our anticipated growth in product revenues as well as our gross margins 
because we protect many of our retail customers and distributors against the effects of price decreases on their inventories of our products  we have in the past and may in the future incur large price protection charges if we reduce our prices when there are large quantities of our products in our distribution channel 
more than half of our product sales in and were made through distributors and retailers to which we have provided price protection 
price protection allows customers to receive a price adjustment on existing inventory when its published price is reduced 
in an environment of slower demand and abundant supply of products  price declines and channel promotions expenses are more likely to occur and  should they occur  are more likely to have a significant impact on our operating results 
further  in this environment  high channel inventory may result in substantial price protection charges 
these price protection charges have the effect of reducing gross sales and gross margin 
during  we incurred approximately million in price protection charges  and we anticipate that we will continue to incur price protection charges for the foreseeable future due to competitive pricing pressures 
if our price protection reserves are insufficient or we are not able to estimate future charges  our revenues and gross margins would be adversely affected in future periods 
because many of our retail customers and distributors have rights of return  we may be required to take back large quantities of unsold customer inventory  which could reduce our revenues 
substantially all of our sales of our digital film products to end users are made through distributors and retailers 
our sales through these channels often include rights to return unsold customer inventory 
for sales of some of our products  we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products  although we establish reserves for estimated returns 
additionally  we permit some of our customers to return products in their inventory for credit or in exchange for new products 
if there are significant inventories of old products in our distribution channel when a new product is released  or if these distributors and retailers are unsuccessful in selling our products  there could be substantial product returns 
if our reserves are insufficient to account for these returns or if we are unable to resell these products on a timely basis at similar prices  our revenues may be reduced 
because the market for our products is rapidly evolving  we may not be able to resell returned products at attractive prices or at all 
if our customers elect to compete with us in the digital film market  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline 
we sell our compactflash controllers to companies that could use our controllers to manufacture compactflash products 
many of these customers are large companies that have longer operating histories and greater brand recognition  greater access to flash memory  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources and longer standing relationships with customers 
if these companies were to choose to compete directly with us in the digital film market  our revenues and gross margins would likely decline 
if we are unable to generate increased revenue from licensing our controller technology and selling our controllers on a stand alone basis to third parties  our gross margins may be negatively impacted and we may have difficulty sustaining profitability 
we have historically derived the substantial majority of our revenues from the sale of our digital film and connectivity products 
we believe  however  that our future growth and ability to sustain profitability may depend on our ability to license our proprietary controller technology for use in new digital photography applications or applications in other markets  such as music  video and cell phones  and to generate increased revenues from the sales of our controllers 
if we fail to generate significant licensing revenues from these activities or increase the revenues we derive from our controller sales  we may not grow our revenues and margins as planned and we may have difficulty sustaining profitability 
in march  we terminated our prior license agreement with samsung and executed a new license agreement that renewed and extended the prior license 
under this new agreement  samsung prepaid fixed royalties due under the prior license agreement at a discount rate 
samsung also paid additional licensing fees for expanded rights to license our technology 
the license payments are fixed through the first eight quarters of the agreement through march  and become variable thereafter 
whether we will be paid any royalties under the variable royalty obligations depends on a number of factors  including which flash products samsung manufactures and sells and in what volumes  as well as our relative market shares and our aggregate purchases from samsung 
we cannot assure you that we will be paid any amounts in variable royalties 
either party can terminate the agreement in the event of the other party s breach of the agreement or bankruptcy 
if our licensing revenue declines  our revenues and gross margins will be significantly negatively impacted and we may have difficulty sustaining profitability 
we depend on a few key customers and the loss of any of them could significantly reduce our revenues 

table of contents historically  a small number of our customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
during  sales to the ten customers from which we received the greatest revenues accounted for approximately of our total gross revenues 
our revenues could decline if one or more of these customers were to significantly reduce  delay or cancel their orders  decide to purchase digital film manufactured by one of our competitors  develop and manufacture their own digital film or cease operations due to the downturn in the global economy or otherwise 
in addition  we do not carry credit insurance on our accounts receivables and any difficulty in collecting outstanding amounts due from our customers  particularly customers that place larger orders or experience financial difficulties  could adversely affect our revenues and our net income 
because our sales are made by means of standard purchase orders rather than long term contracts  we cannot assure you that these customers will continue to purchase quantities of our products at current levels  or at all 
furthermore  our revenues include sales to oems  some of which have  or may in the future  decide to compete against us in the digital film market 
we expect our operating results for at least the next several years to continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers 
if we are unable to develop and introduce  on a timely basis  new products or services that are accepted by our customers and consumers  we will not be able to compete effectively in our market 
we operate in an industry that is subject to evolving industry standards  rapid technological changes  rapid changes in consumer demands and the rapid introduction of new  higher performance products that shorten product life cycles and tend to decrease average selling prices 
to remain competitive in this demanding market  we must continually design  develop and introduce new products and services that meet the performance and price requirements of our customers and consumers 
any significant delay or failure in releasing new products or services would harm our reputation  provide a competitor a first to market opportunity or allow a competitor to achieve greater market share 
also  we cannot assure you that any products or services we do introduce will gain market acceptance 
the introduction of new products is inherently risky because it is difficult to foresee advances in technology and the adoption of new standards  to coordinate our technical personnel and strategic relationships and to identify and eliminate design and product flaws 
we may not be able to recoup research and development expenditures if our new products or services are not widely accepted 
if we are unable to develop or maintain the strategic relationships necessary to develop  sell and market products that are commercially viable and widely accepted  the growth and success of our business may be limited 
we may not be able to develop and sell products that are commercially viable and widely accepted if we are unable to anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of digital camera and flash memory manufacturers 
we must continue to collaborate closely with our customers  digital camera manufacturers  flash memory manufacturers and other suppliers to ensure that critical development  marketing and distribution projects proceed in a coordinated manner 
this collaboration is also important because our ability to anticipate trends and plan our development activities depends to a significant degree upon our continued access to information derived from strategic relationships we currently have with digital camera and flash memory manufacturers 
this collaboration can be difficult because many of these companies are located in europe or asia 
if any of our current relationships terminate or otherwise deteriorate  or if we are unable to enter into future alliances that provide us with comparable insight into market trends  we will be hindered in our product development efforts 
we rely to a significant degree on retailers to sell our digital film products 
we sell a significant percentage of our digital film products to retailers  most notably walmart  compusa  ritz  office max and target rather than through oems 
as such  we are subject to many risks  including the following loss of market share if the retailers that carry our products do not grow as quickly and sell as many digital film products as the retailers that carry the digital film products of our competitors  product returns could increase as a result of our strategic interest in assisting retailers in balancing their inventories  reduced ability to forecast sales  reduction of gross margins  delays in collecting receivables and increased inventory levels due to the increasing tendency for some retailers to require products on a consignment basis  retailers may emphasize our competitors products over our products  or decline to carry our products  and continued downward pricing pressure in the retail channel has and could continue to necessitate price protection of the inventories of our products that many of our customers carry 

table of contents because we depend on single suppliers for some key components and products and do not have long term supply contracts with those suppliers  we are exposed to the risks of a potential inability to obtain an adequate supply of components  price increases  late deliveries and poor component quality 
zetex semiconductors is the sole manufacturer of transistors for our compactflash and connectivity products  japan aviation electronics industry  ltd 
is the sole manufacturer of connectors for our jumpdrive products  nec is the sole manufacturer of the interface circuit for our jumpdrive products and hoshiden is the sole manufacturer of the switches for our memory stick products 
we rely on additional vendors for other critical components 
because we depend on single suppliers for certain key components  and do not have a long term supply contract with these suppliers  we face the risk of inadequate component supply  price increases  late deliveries and poor component quality 
any supplier may terminate their relationships with us or pursue other relationships with our competitors  and if we were to lose our relationship with these single suppliers  the lead time required to qualify new suppliers could be as long as three months 
also  if we lose our single suppliers or these suppliers are otherwise unable to satisfy our volume and delivery schedule requirements  it may be difficult to locate any suppliers who have the ability to develop  manufacture and deliver the specialized components we need for our products 
if we are unable to accurately predict our supply needs  or if our supply of components is disrupted  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose existing customers or be unable to attract new customers 
we also do not manufacture certain flash cards such as the sd card  smartmedia card  xd picture card or multi media card 
until we develop our own flash memory controller for these and other products  we purchase such cards from third parties for resale 
we do not have a long term supply contract with these suppliers  and therefore face the risks of inadequate supply  price increases  late delivery or unavailability 
if our supply of such products is disrupted  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose existing customers or be unable to attract new customers 
we depend on united microelectronics corporation  or umc  to manufacture all of our controllers  and if we are unable to obtain from umc sufficient quantities of controllers at acceptable quality  yields and prices  and in a timely manner  we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could limit the growth and success of our business 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility  or fab 
instead  we rely on a single outside foundry  umc of taiwan  to produce all of our controller products 
our reliance on an independent foundry involves a number of significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  lack of guaranteed production capacity or product supply  and unavailability of  or delayed access to  next generation or key process technologies 
we do not have a long term supply agreement with umc and instead obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis 
umc has no obligation to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as set forth in a particular purchase order 
our requirements represent a small portion of the total production capacity of umc  and umc may reallocate capacity to other customers on short notice  even during periods of high demand for our products 
if umc were to become unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our controllers in the required volumes  at acceptable quality  yields and prices  and in a timely manner  we might not be able to meet customer demand for our products  which could limit the growth and success of our business 
although we have attempted to diversify our sources of controllers by qualifying other fabs  such as taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation  we cannot assure you that they will have sufficient capacity to accommodate our demand at any particular time 
in addition  if competition for foundry capacity increases  we may incur significant expenses to secure access to manufacturing services  which in turn may cause our product costs to increase substantially 
we expect that the demand for capacity at these facilities will change in the near future due to fluctuating demand for consumer electronic and industrial products that depend on semiconductors manufactured at these facilities 
all of these foundries are located in an area of the world that may be subject to political and economic instability and natural disasters  particularly earthquakes 
while the last major earthquake in taiwan did not have a significant impact on deliveries to us from umc  a similar event in the future at one of their foundries could have a significant impact 
we depend solely on third party subcontractors for assembly and testing of our digital film products  which could result in product shortages or delays or increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
our compactflash digital film is currently assembled and tested by venture manufacturing services in newark  california and venture manufacturing in singapore and bintan  malaysia  vitron in san jose  california and pc partner in china 
we do not have a long term agreement with vitron  venture manufacturing or pc partner and typically obtain services from them on a per order basis 
additionally  our controllers are assembled  tested and packaged primarily by advanced semiconductor engineering  inc in taiwan and multitech design test  inc in sunnyvale  california 
our reliance on these subcontractors 
table of contents involves risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  inventory levels and costs 
these risks could result in product shortages or increase our costs of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products 
if these subcontractors are unable or unwilling to continue to provide assembly and test services and deliver products of acceptable quality  at acceptable costs and in a timely manner  we would have to identify and qualify other subcontractors 
this could be time consuming and difficult and result in unforeseen operations problems 
our unit volume has increased substantially over the last year and has strained our operations infrastructure and our supply chain 
over the last year  the number of units we manufacture on a weekly basis has increased significantly 
this significant increase in growth has strained our supply chain and operations capabilities 
if we are not able to continue to accommodate this increased unit demand from our customers  we may have product shortages 
if we were to have product shortages  our customers would likely cancel orders or seek other suppliers to replace us 
in addition  we must continue to make significant investments in our existing internal information management systems to support increased manufacturing  as well as accounting and other management related functions 
our systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support rapid growth  which could in turn harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our failure to successfully promote our brand and achieve strong brand recognition in target markets could limit or reduce the demand for our products and services 
we believe that brand recognition will be important to our ability to be successful as the digital photography market continues to develop 
we plan to continue to invest in marketing programs to create and maintain prominent brand awareness 
if we fail to promote our brand successfully  or the expenses associated with doing so become increasingly high  our business may not grow as we anticipate 
in addition  if our products exhibit poor performance or other defects  our brand may be adversely affected  which would inhibit our ability to attract or retain customers 
if we encounter difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified personnel  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy and we may need to grant large stock based incentives that could be dilutive to our stockholders and may be required to pay significant salaries which would increase our general and administrative costs 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our key employees  including eric b 
stang  our president and chief executive officer  and petro estakhri  our chief technology officer and executive vice president of engineering 
our success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  finance and managerial personnel 
if we are unable to find  hire and retain qualified individuals  we may have difficulty implementing portions of our business strategy in a timely manner  or at all 
we may experience difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may be required to grant large option or other stock based incentive awards  which may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders 
we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses to attract and retain these individuals  which could harm our operating results 
if we do not succeed in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications  we will not be able to grow our business 
if our products contain defects  we may incur unexpected and significant operating expenses to correct the defects  we may be required to pay damages to third parties and our reputation may suffer serious harm 
although our digital film products are tested after they are assembled  these products are extremely complex and may contain defects 
these defects are particularly likely when new versions or enhancements are released 
the sale of products with defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems may damage our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for example  if there are defects in our products that cause loss of data  customers may lose their digital images stored on our digital film 
in addition  product defects and errors could result in additional development costs  diversion of technical and management resources  delayed product shipments  increased product returns  and product liability claims against us which may not be fully covered by insurance 
our significant sales outside the united states subject us to increasing foreign political and economic risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  and it may be difficult for us to anticipate demand and pricing in those regions or effectively manage the distributor channels and relationships in those regions 
sales outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our total net revenues for the quarter ended december  and approximately for the year ended december  we generated a majority of our international revenues from licensing agreements in asia and product sales in europe and asia 
the european and asian markets are intensely competitive 
one of our principal growth strategies is to expand our presence in this and other international markets both through increased international sales and strategic relationships 
we have begun conducting transactions in the euro  and are expanding distribution of our products into latin america 
consequently  we anticipate that sales outside of the united states will 
table of contents continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues in future periods 
accordingly  we are subject to international risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  political and economic instability  delays in meeting customer commitments due to difficulties associated with managing an international distribution system  increased time to collect receivables caused by slower payment practices that are common in many international markets  difficulties associated with managing export licenses  tariffs and other regulatory issues pertaining to international trade  increased effort and costs associated with the protection of our intellectual property in foreign countries  natural disasters  political uncertainties and changing regulator environments in foreign countries  and difficulties in hiring and managing employees in foreign countries 
in addition  if we are unable to accurately anticipate demand and pricing of products in international markets  or if we cannot work effectively with our distribution partners to create demand  develop effective marketing programs  manage inventory levels and collect receivables in a timely fashion  our operating results will be harmed and our stock price will likely decline 
the sales of our products are denominated primarily in united states dollars 
as a result  increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could cause our products to become less competitive in international markets and could result in a reduction in sales and profitability 
we have product sales denominated in british pounds  euros and other european currencies  as well as the japanese yen 
in addition  we anticipate having some sales in latin american currencies in to the extent our prices are denominated in foreign currencies  particularly the british pound and japanese yen  we will be exposed to increased risks of currency fluctuations 
we have foreign subsidiaries in great britain and japan that operate and sell our products in various global markets 
as a result  we are exposed to risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use forward contracts  to manage the exposures associated with our net asset or liability positions 
however  we cannot assure you that any policies or techniques that we have implemented will be successful or that our business and financial condition will not be harmed by exchange rate fluctuations 
risks related to our industry our business will not succeed unless the digital photography market continues to grow and is accepted by professional  commercial and consumer users 
we currently depend on sales of digital film and connectivity products to digital camera owners for a substantial portion of our revenues  which exposes us to substantial risk in the event the digital photography market does not grow rapidly 
the digital photography market is in an early stage of development and is rapidly evolving 
the success of this market depends on many factors  including the ability of digital cameras to take high quality photographs  the availability of digital cameras at prices and with performance characteristics comparable to traditional cameras  the availability of digital film that meet users requirements with respect to price  speed  connectivity  capacity and compatibility  the speed at which digital cameras are able to take successive photographs  the ease with which digital files can be transferred to a personal computer or printer  the availability of digital image prints comparable in quality and price to traditional photographs  and market conditions in the industry and the economy as a whole 

table of contents in addition to the above factors related to the digital photography market as a whole  we believe the following additional factors will affect the successful adoption of digital photography by consumers marketing campaigns that increase brand awareness in end user markets  both domestically and internationally  increased association between brand names and attractive price and performance characteristics  and heightened consumer confidence in digital photography technology 
if the digital photography market does not continue to grow and be accepted by professional  commercial and consumer users  our business will not succeed 
general economic conditions  political and military conditions associated with current worldwide conflicts and similar events may prevent consumers from purchasing our products and reduced demand for digital media and related products may prevent us from achieving targeted revenues and profitability 
sales of consumer electronic products have historically been dependent upon discretionary spending by consumers  which may be adversely affected by general economic conditions 
the recent decline in consumer confidence and the continuing slowdown in the united states economy may cause consumers to defer decisions to purchase our products 
some analysts have predicted a further decline in the united states economy will result from recent volatility in the financial markets and the threat of war with iraq 
if the economy continues to decline as a result of recent economic  political and social turmoil  consumers may reduce discretionary spending and may not purchase our products  which would harm our revenues 
our revenues and our ability to sustain profitability depend significantly on the overall demand for flash cards and related products 
our customers decisions to purchase our products are largely discretionary 
the slowdown in the us and global economy may cause customers to defer or alter purchasing decisions  and accordingly could reduce demand for our products 
softening demand for these products caused by worsening economic conditions has resulted in the past  and may again in the future result  in decreased revenues 
as a result  there is uncertainty with respect to our expected revenues for  and further delays or reductions in spending on digital film and related products could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
our stock price and those of other technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and  accordingly  our stock price may continue to be volatile which could negatively affect your investment 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in august and is significantly below the original offering price of per share 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new products or new pricing policies by us or by our competitors  departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant orders or customers  sales of common stock by our officers and directors  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole 
in addition  stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies operating performance 
public announcements by companies in our industry concerning  among other things  their performance  accounting practices or legal problems could cause fluctuations in the market for stocks of these companies 
these fluctuations could lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could harm our operating results and our business 

table of contents if digital camera manufacturers do not develop and promote products that are able to take advantage of our fastest digital film products  the growth and success of our business may be limited 
we depend on the research and development  marketing and sales efforts of digital camera manufacturers in developing  marketing and selling digital cameras that can use our more advanced existing and future products 
most of the digital cameras currently available on the market do not incorporate technologies that can take advantage of the speed available in our fastest digital film products 
if digital camera manufacturers do not successfully develop  market and sell digital cameras that take full advantage of our most advanced products  from which we realize higher gross margins  the growth and success of our business may be negatively impacted 
the manufacturing of our products is complex and subject to yield problems  which could decrease available supply and increase costs 
the manufacture of flash memory and controllers is a complex process  and it is often difficult for companies to achieve acceptable product yields 
reduced flash memory yields could decrease available supply and increase costs 
controller yields depend on both our product design and the manufacturing process technology unique to the semiconductor foundry 
because low yields may result from either design defects or process difficulties  we may not identify yield problems until well into the production cycle  when an actual product exists and can be analyzed and tested 
in addition  many of these yield problems are difficult to diagnose and time consuming or expensive to remedy 
risks related to our intellectual property if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitors may gain access to our technology  which could harm our ability to successfully compete in our market 
we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  we may be unable to successfully compete in our market 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as confidentiality agreements and other methods to protect our proprietary technologies 
as of march   we have been granted or allowed patents in the united states and other countries and have pending united states and foreign patent applications 
we cannot assure you  however  that any of our existing or future patents will not be invalidated  patents will be issued for any of our pending applications  any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will have sufficient scope or strength  or our patents will be issued in the primary countries where our products are sold in order to protect our rights and potential commercial advantage 
it may also be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
we are involved in intellectual property litigation  and expect to become involved in additional litigation that could divert management s time and attention  be time consuming and expensive to defend and limit our access to important technology 
we are a party to litigation with third parties to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of others intellectual property 
we expect to be involved in additional patent litigation in the near future 
these lawsuits could subject us to significant liability for damages 
these lawsuits could also lead to the invalidation of our patent rights 
patent lawsuits are extremely expensive and time consuming and can divert management s time and attention 
when we sue other companies for patent infringement  it may prompt them to respond by suing us for infringement of their patents 
we are also negotiating license agreements with third parties  which could result in litigation if these negotiations are unsuccessful 
additional patent litigation would significantly increase our legal expenses  which would result in higher operational expenses and lower operating margins 
any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following stop selling products or using technology that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property  attempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and attempt to redesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property 

table of contents if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  we may incur additional costs or be unable to manufacture and sell our products 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we sell our products primarily to customers in the us and  to a lesser extent  japan  europe and canada 
most of our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  however  we anticipate an increasing amount of our sales will be denominated in british pounds  the japanese yen  the euro and possibly latin american currencies 
foreign currency denominated revenues were approximately  and of our total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign currency denominated costs were approximately  and of our cost of product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as a result  it is possible that our future financial results could be directly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and the prices of our products would become more expensive in a particular foreign market if the value of the us dollar rises in comparison to the local currency  which may make it more difficult to sell our products in that market 
we will continue to face foreign currency exchange risk in the future 
therefore  our financial results could be directly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
in addition  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
these risks could become more significant if we expand business outside the us or if we increase sales in non us dollar denominated currencies 
we have adopted and implemented a hedging policy to mitigate these potential risks 
we use forward contracts  to manage the exposures associated with our net asset or liability positions 
however  we cannot assure you that any policies or techniques that we have implemented  or may implement in the future  will be successful or that our business and financial condition will not be harmed by exchange rate fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we record our hedges of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at fair value with the related gains or losses recorded in foreign exchange gain or loss in our statements of operations 
during the year ended december   we entered into hedges on intercompany payables denominated in the british pound and japanese yen 
the gains and losses on these contracts were substantially offset by transaction losses and gains on the underlying balances being hedged 
in addition  during the year ended december   we had foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities that were not hedged 
our net foreign exchange losses on hedging transactions were approximately million for the year ended december  as of december   we held forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of million to hedge the risks associated with british pound and japanese yen denominated assets and liabilities 
a adverse move in currency exchange rates affecting the contracts would decrease the fair value of the contracts by million 
however  if this occurred  the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would increase by a similar amount 
accordingly we believe that the hedging of our foreign currency exposure should have no material impact on income or cash flow 
we did not enter into any hedging transactions during the years ended december  or interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to the exposure related to those debt instruments and credit facilities that are tied to market rates 
accordingly  our interest rate risk is primarily related to our credit facility with greater bay bank 
at december   we had million outstanding under this facility 
at december   our agreement with greater bay bank provided for interest at an annual rate of the bank s prime rate plus of the gross amount financed 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   this increase would result in a decline in income before taxes in of approximately  we do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
we plan to mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
we have historically invested in investment grade  short term securities that we have held until maturity to limit our market risk 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially
