in each applicable fiscal year  acquisitions affected our financial results  when compared to the prior year  for the portion of the year following their respective dates of acquisition 
analysis of consolidated income statements for fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the incremental impact of three printing businesses we acquired during the quarter ended march  and two printing businesses we acquired during the quarter ended june  accounted for million of the increase 
the remainder of our sales increase demonstrates the initial return on our efforts to expand market share through our recruiting program for experienced sales professionals and our pursuit of national accounts 
gross profit margin for fiscal declined to from in fiscal  reflecting continued pricing pressures caused by the overall weakness in the u 
s economy and prevailing adverse industry conditions 
further  overall gross profit margins were diluted by the gross profit margins of the printing businesses we acquired in fiscal and generally  gross profit margins of printing businesses we acquire are lower than our company s historical average and typically improve over time as we work with the management of the acquired businesses to implement cost savings strategies and other operating best practices 
selling expenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  corresponding to the higher sales levels noted above 
as a percentage of sales  selling expenses for fiscal increased to from in fiscal this increase reflects our investments in recruiting and hiring new sales professionals and marketing efforts to promote our extensive printing capabilities and complementary services 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease results from our discontinuing the amortization of goodwill  which totaled million in fiscal  pursuant to our adoption of sfas no 
as of april  see below 
this decrease was partially offset by higher administrative costs attributable to our recently acquired printing businesses 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses for fiscal declined to from in fiscal  due to the aforementioned change in accounting for goodwill amortization  coupled with our efforts to control administrative costs and thereby leverage the higher sales levels described above 
net interest expense for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal this decrease is due to lower borrowings outstanding under our variable rate bank credit facility  coupled with a more favorable interest rate environment as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we refinanced certain of our outstanding term equipment notes during the year to take further advantage of such favorable environment see liquidity and capital resources debt obligations below 
effective april   we adopted sfas no 
which required us to discontinue amortizing goodwill and perform a series of transitional impairment tests to determine if the remaining balance of goodwill of each of our reporting units  which totaled million as of march   should be reduced to reflect its estimated fair value 
we determined that each of our individual printing businesses constitutes a stand alone reporting unit under sfas no 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we recognized an after tax transitional impairment charge of million net of a deferred tax benefit of million  and such charge was classified as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as provided for by the new accounting standard 
further  in connection with our annual impairment test conducted as of march   as required by sfas no 
 we recorded an additional goodwill impairment charge of million in the quarter ended march  the impairment resulted principally from the impact that the continued weakness in printing industry conditions and other negative economic factors discussed above had on our reporting units 
we provided for income taxes of million for fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal the fiscal income tax provision was reduced by a tax benefit of million related to the goodwill impairment charge noted above

in particular  the commercial printing industry was directly impacted by a reduction in advertising spending as a result of the economic weakness 
our decision to exit a portion of our business at one operation and combine three small  under performing operations into nearby facilities during the quarter ended march   also contributed to the decrease 
the impact of the three printing businesses acquired late in fiscal partially offset the decreases discussed above 
gross profit margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal competitive pricing pressures resulting from the prevailing economic conditions discussed above primarily contributed to this decrease  while the fixed overhead costs necessary to operate our facilities and equipment remained relatively constant
