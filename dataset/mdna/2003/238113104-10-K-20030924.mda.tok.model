dollars in millions  except eps year ended june  net earnings earnings per share  diluted comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales the following table shows sales by product line over the past three fiscal years 
sales by product line dollars in millions year ended june  patient monitoring change from prior year of total sales cardiac assist change from prior year of total sales interventional products formerly collagen products change from prior year of total sales vascular grafts change from prior year of total sales genisphere change from prior year of total sales total sales change from prior year net earnings and earnings per share in fiscal years  and shown above include the following fiscal gain on legal settlement of million after tax or per diluted share 
fiscal restructuring charges of million after tax or per diluted share 
fiscal gain on sale of underutilized facility of thousand after tax or per diluted share 
sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million last year 
cardiac assist cardiac assist product sales increased to million in fiscal the increase is due to stronger worldwide sales of intra aortic balloon pumps  a modest increase in sales of balloon iab catheters and the favorable effect of foreign exchange translation 
the company s distributor in japan reduced purchases of iab catheters in the first half of the fiscal year in order to reduce inventory and resumed its normal purchasing pattern in the second half of the year 
sales of the new  premium priced fidelitytm fr 
iab catheter continued to grow  accounting for of total iab catheter sales in the fourth quarter 
patient monitoring sales of patient monitoring products rose to million in fiscal the sales increase reflects strong growth of several product lines  including accutorr plus r noninvasive blood pressure monitors  wireless central monitoring systems  masimo set r pulse oximetry sensors and the anestartm anesthesia delivery system 
favorable foreign exchange translation also contributed to sales growth 
during the third quarter  the company positioned itself for renewed growth in the bedside monitoring market segment with the introduction of two new monitors  spectrumtm and triotm 
the spectrum monitor is a battery powered  portable bedside monitor for the high end  critical care market  a million market segment 
the trio is a compact and highly portable monitor with applications in a wide variety of hospital and outpatient settings 
it is aimed at price sensitive markets such as surgery centers  general hospital applications and international markets 
the trio should enable datascope to expand its share of an estimated million low end monitor market 
shipments of spectrum in the us and to international markets began in the third quarter 
shipments of trio to international markets began in the third quarter  and us sales are expected to begin in the first half of fiscal when fda market clearance is expected 
sales of bedside monitors increased in the fourth quarter following the introduction of these two new products 
sales of the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million compared to million last year 
interventional products sales of vasoseal r sealing devices decreased to million from million last year due to continued strong competition and to the production problem that arose shortly after manufacturing of vasoseal elitetm began in the third quarter  which interrupted the launch of this next generation product 
this production problem was resolved and shipments of vasoseal elite devices  which incorporate a new  proprietary collagen hemostat  resumed in june 
sales of collagen hemostats were million compared to million last year with the decrease due to reduced sales in international markets 
during the first quarter of fiscal we changed the name of our collagen products division  which manufactures and markets the vasoseal devices  to the interventional products division 
the new name reflects our objective to broaden the product portfolio offered by the division to include new products for interventional cardiology and interventional radiology that are not collagen based 
the first of these new products  an innovative pressure assisted dressing for post hemostasis wound management  is expected to be launched in the first half of the new fiscal year 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular  inc s products increased to million  primarily reflecting favorable foreign exchange translation  a full year of direct sales in the us  and increased sales of the intergard silver anti microbial graft in europe 
sales in the us were also higher than last year because the company s former distributor  whose termination became effective at the end of december  placed no orders in the second quarter last year 
we are continuing to seek fda approval to sell intergard silver grafts in the united states 
masimo set is a registered trademark of masimo corporation 
genisphere sales of genisphere products were million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year  as genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the weaker us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound increased consolidated sales by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses the gross profit percentage of for fiscal was unchanged from last year 
an improved gross margin in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment as a result of cost reduction programs and higher average selling prices was offset by the effect of a less favorable sales mix  the write off of obsolete inventory related to the mr monitor line and costs associated with the vasoseal elite production problem 
in addition  for fiscal  the gross margin was favorably impacted by an insurance settlement of thousand recorded in the first quarter related to unusable collagen inventory  which was reserved for in june with a charge to cost of sales 
datascope filed a claim under its property insurance policy for the unusable collagen inventory 
when the company received the insurance settlement of thousand  in the first quarter of fiscal  the settlement was accounted for as a reduction to cost of sales  consistent with the accounting treatment for the related inventory reserve 
we continued our companywide focus on new product development and improvements of existing products in fiscal spending on research and development r d reflects investment in new product development programs  sustaining r d on existing products  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal  equivalent to of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
r d expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase primarily due to new product development projects in patient monitoring 
r d expenses for the interventional products vascular grafts segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the increase primarily due to new product development projects in intervascular 
the balance of consolidated r d is in corporate and other and amounted to million in fiscal compared to million for the comparable period last year 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal  or of sales compared to million  or of sales last year 
sg a expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal  primarily attributable to filling open positions  costs associated with the increased sales and the impact of foreign exchange translation 
sg a expenses for the interventional products vascular grafts segment decreased to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower selling and marketing expenses in interventional products  partially offset by increased selling expenses in intervascular due to a full year of us direct field force expenses in fiscal compared to a half year in fiscal and the impact of foreign exchange translation 
segment sg a expenses include fixed corporate g a charges that are offset in corporate and other 
the weaker us dollar compared to the euro and the british pound increased total sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal gain on legal settlement in july  we instituted patent infringement litigation relating to a vascular sealing method against vascular solutions  inc in the united states district court  district of minnesota 
in that litigation our complaint alleged that the manufacture  use and or sale of vascular solutions duett device infringed our united states patent no 
 in november  the parties settled the matter 
pursuant to the settlement  vascular solutions paid us million and we granted vascular solutions a limited  non exclusive patent license 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax gain on the settlement  net of related legal expenses  of million  or million after tax  equivalent to per diluted share 
restructuring charges in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million 
the restructuring charges consisted of the following 
o severance expenses  asset write downs and contractual obligations related to the closure of the vasoseal manufacturing and r d facility in vaals  the netherlands  and severance expenses for us employees 
o asset write downs  severance expenses and contractual and incremental obligations associated with exiting the coronary stent sales business in europe  including the resulting impairment of our investments in amg and qualimed 
o closure of an unprofitable cardiac assist direct sales operation in a european country 
o workforce reductions in patient monitoring 
the workforce reductions totaled employees or of our worldwide employment 
the restructuring programs were completed in fiscal interest income interest income was million in fiscal compared to million last year  with the decrease primarily the result of a decline in the average yield from to  partially offset by a higher average portfolio balance million vs 
million 
income taxes in fiscal  the consolidated effective tax rate was compared to last year 
the consolidated effective tax rate for fiscal was significantly impacted by expenses related to the restructuring programs in the first and second quarters which were not deductible for tax purposes  primarily in international businesses 
the effect on the consolidated tax rate of the gain on legal settlement in fiscal and the restructuring charge in fiscal was and  respectively 
the remaining increase in the consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in state income tax rates 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million  or per diluted share last year 
the increased earnings in fiscal primarily reflects an increased gross margin from higher sales in all product lines  except vasoseal  the gain on legal settlement million after tax  and the negative impact on earnings last year of the restructuring charges million after tax  partially offset by higher r d and sg a expenses  as discussed above 
foreign currency due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the liabilities and transactions being hedged 
a portion of the net foreign transaction gain or loss is reported in our statement of consolidated earnings in cost of sales and the balance in other income and expense 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed 
comparison of results fiscal vs 
fiscal sales sales of the cardiac assist monitoring products segment in fiscal increased to million from million in cardiac assist sales of cardiac assist products were million  below fiscal  primarily due to an exceptionally large number of pumps sold in the previous year in the us to replace discontinued pump models 
the worldwide market for intra aortic balloon catheters in fiscal remained essentially unchanged  as growth in international markets offset a decline in the us market 
our strong worldwide market share also remained unchanged 
our new iab catheter  the fidelity fr  which was introduced in february  continued to be well received by customers and accounted for of all datascope balloon catheter unit sales at the end of the fourth quarter  its first full quarter of sales 
the fidelity catheter is priced at a modest premium to the profile catheter which it is intended to replace 
patient monitoring patient monitoring sales rose to million for the year 
this strong sales growth was primarily attributable to increased sales in the us of wireless monitoring systems and a continued sharp gain in sales of masimo set pulse oximetry sensors 
the new wireless systems use a protected radio band allocated for medical use by the federal communications commission 
increased sales of passport r portable monitors and accutorr plus noninvasive blood pressure monitors also contributed to growth 
sales of the collagen products vascular grafts segment were million compared to million in collagen products sales of vasoseal r arterial puncture sealing devices decreased to million  reflecting competitive market conditions and loss of market share 
vasoseal s new deployment technique called modified hold technique  or mht  introduced to the us market in mid april  protects the mechanical seal created by deployment of vasoseal s collagen plug  thereby largely eliminating the previous need for post procedure hold in order to achieve hemostasis 
the apparent usage of vasoseal in those hospitals certified to practice mht was running higher than usage prior to the introduction of mht 
retraining physicians for mht  however  has proved to be more difficult and time consuming than previously anticipated and this has slowed the introduction of mht to about of hospitals purchasing vasoseal at june  in the fourth quarter of  we received the ce mark for vasoseal elite  the next generation of both the es and vhd products  which embodies a new  proprietary hemostat that rapidly expands as it comes into contact with blood 
also in the fourth quarter  we received fda approval for vasoseal low profile  a downsized vhd model aimed at the growing market segment for and fr 
diagnostic procedures 
sales of collagen hemostats increased to million  primarily due to increased sales in international markets 
vascular grafts sales of intervascular  inc increased to million  reflecting continued strong demand for the intergard silver anti microbial graft in international markets and the contribution from sales of peripheral stents 
total international sales increased for the year 
sales in the us declined as the result of the termination  effective december   of intervascular s former distributor  which placed no orders in the second quarter upon being notified of its termination 
datascope began selling intervascular products through its dedicated direct sales organization in the us in january genisphere in fiscal  genisphere continued to pursue its marketing strategy  to target major academic institutions and the research and development department of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and sales remained unchanged at million 
investment spending for the development of the genisphere business was approximately million in fiscal  compared to million in the prior year 
the stronger us dollar compared to major european currencies decreased consolidated sales by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal costs and expenses the gross profit percentage was for fiscal compared to in fiscal the decreased gross margin was primarily attributable to a reduced gross margin in the cardiac assist monitoring products segment  as a result of a less favorable sales mix due to increased sales of lower margin patient monitoring products and decreased sales of higher margin cardiac assist products 
reduced sales of high margin vasoseal products also contributed to the decrease in the gross margin 
we continued our companywide focus on new product development and improvement of existing products in fiscal spending on r d reflects investment in new product development programs  regulatory compliance and clinical evaluations 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million and increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal compared to in fiscal r d expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal  primarily due to the increase in new product development projects in patient monitoring 
r d expenses for the collagen products vascular grafts segment decreased to million in fiscal  with the decrease primarily due to lower expenditures in the collagen products business 
the balance of consolidated r d is in corporate and other and amounted to million in fiscal  unchanged from the previous year 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  sg a expenses were in fiscal compared to in fiscal sg a expenses for the cardiac assist monitoring products segment increased to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to filling open field sales positions and territory expansions in cardiac assist and patient monitoring 
sg a expenses for the collagen products vascular grafts segment increased to million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to the investment in building a us direct field sales force for intervascular  inc segment sg a expenses include fixed corporate g a charges that are offset in corporate and other 
the stronger us dollar compared to major european currencies decreased total sg a expenses by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal restructuring charges in the first and second quarters of fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling l million 
the restructuring programs were committed to and approved by management and the board of directors during such quarters and the charges were recorded under the guidelines of the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
for example  for the involuntary termination benefits  the charge was recorded after all four of the conditions discussed in eitf existed 
the restructuring programs in the first quarter of fiscal were as follows vasoseal centralization of manufacturing and cost reduction initiatives in the vasoseal business  which had experienced pressure on revenue growth due to competition 
as a result of the restructuring  the high cost vasoseal manufacturing and r d facility in vaals  the netherlands  was closed and placed on the market for sale  and the manufacture of vasoseal products was centralized in the mahwah  new jersey facility by the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal the vaals facility has not yet been sold 
restructuring charges for this program included asset write downs resulting from the restructuring decision  contractual and incremental obligations  including lease termination costs and legal fees related to the plant closure  severance expenses for manufacturing and r d employees in the netherlands and severance expenses for us employees 
cardiac assist reorganization and streamlining of operations in the cardiac assist business  which had experienced pressure on revenue growth 
restructuring charges represented severance expenses for us employees 
all of the us employees terminated in the first quarter restructuring programs left the company by september  and the vaals employees left the company by the end of may severance for the vaals employees was paid in cash by the end of fiscal severance for us employees was paid in cash by the end of fiscal the restructuring programs in the second quarter of fiscal were as follows stents exiting the coronary stent business in europe based on the highly competitive stent market and analysis of future economic contributions of the stent business  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company decided to exit the coronary stent business 
in conjunction with this decision  the company decided not to exercise its option to purchase the remaining of the equity of amg and qualimed  two private german companies involved in the distribution  development and manufacture of stent products  and to discontinue financial support to these businesses 
as a consequence of these decisions and the anticipated resulting impact on the operations of amg and qualimed  we determined that there had been an other than temporary decline in the value of these investments 
as a result of our decision to exit this business  we adjusted the carrying value of these investments to their estimated fair value by writing off our equity investment  as well as existing loans of  to these two companies 
restructuring charges for this program included asset write downs  severance expenses for european employees and contractual and incremental obligations  including legal fees and contract termination costs 
cardiac assist closure of a cardiac assist direct sales operation in a european country  because it was unprofitable 
as a result of the restructuring  cardiac assist products in this country are now distributed by a third party 
restructuring charges primarily included severance expenses for european employees and non cancelable lease termination costs 
vasoseal based on continuing intense competition in the vascular closure market  we implemented additional workforce reductions in the vasoseal business  resulting in severance expenses for us employees 
the restructuring charge also included additional severance expense related to the vaals plant closure  as a result of a further increase to the existing severance packages after the terminations were announced 
patient monitoring cost reduction initiatives in the patient monitoring business to realign the cost structure and streamline operations 
restructuring charges for this program included severance expenses for us employees 
substantially all of the terminated employees from the second quarter restructuring programs left the company by december  interest income interest income for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the decline in interest income in fiscal was the result of a lower average portfolio balance from million to million and a decrease in the average yield from to 
other income during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a pretax gain of thousand  or per share after tax  from the sale of an underutilized facility in oakland  new jersey 
income taxes in fiscal the tax rate was compared to in fiscal the tax rate in fiscal significantly increased due to expenses related to the restructuring programs in the first half of the year that were not deductible for tax purposes  primarily in international businesses 
the tax rate in both years was favorably impacted by the following o the tax benefits from the foreign sales corporation fsc and the extraterritorial income exclusion which replaced the fsc effective january  o income exempt from foreign corporate taxes resulting from the implementation of an alternative tax planning strategy in fiscal for an international manufacturing facility that was tax exempt until january net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share in fiscal compared to million or per diluted share in fiscal the decreased earnings in fiscal primarily reflects the impact of the restructuring charges in fiscal million after tax  slower sales growth  a reduced gross margin percentage resulting primarily from reduced sales of higher margin products and increased sg a and r d expenses  as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  the current ratio was compared to at june  the increase in working capital and the current ratio was primarily the result of an increase in cash and short term investments million and a decrease in current liabilities million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable million and inventories million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million compared to million last year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the higher net earnings  higher depreciation and amortization and a decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities was million  attributable to purchases of investments of million and the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment  offset by million for maturities of investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million  due to million dividends paid and stock repurchases of million  offset by stock option activity of million 
we purchased about  of our common shares for approximately million during fiscal year working capital at june  was million compared to million at june  the current ratio was compared to at june  the decrease in working capital was primarily the result of a decrease in cash and short term investments million  partially offset by a decrease in current liabilities million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million  primarily attributable to net earnings and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by increased other assets and a decrease in accounts payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily attributable to the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment and million equity investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million  attributable to stock repurchases of million and million dividends paid  partially offset by million cash received from exercise of stock options 
we purchased about  of our common shares for approximately million during fiscal year in fiscal  cash provided by operations was million  primarily attributable to net earnings and depreciation and amortization  partially offset by increased inventories and accounts receivable 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  primarily attributable to maturities of marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of marketable securities of million and the purchase of million of property  plant and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities was million  attributable to stock repurchases of million and million dividends paid  partially offset by million cash received from exercise of stock options 
we believe our financial resources are sufficient to meet our projected cash requirements 
the moderate rate of current us inflation has not significantly affected us 
our contractual obligations as of june  were as follows 
in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations     we also have outstanding purchase orders in the ordinary course of business 
information concerning forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of many important factors 
many of these important factors cannot be predicted or quantified and are outside our control  including the possibility that fda clearance will not be received in time to begin sales of the new trio monitor in the first half of fiscal  the new innovative pressure assisted dressing for post hemostasis wound management will not be launched in the first half of fiscal  market conditions may change  particularly as the result of competitive activity in the cardiac assist  vascular sealing and other markets served by the company  the company s dependence on certain unaffiliated suppliers including single source manufacturers for patient monitoring  cardiac assist and vasoseal products and the company s ability to gain market acceptance for new products 
additional risks are the ability of the company to successfully introduce new products  continued demand for the company s products generally  rapid and significant changes that characterize the medical device industry and the ability to continue to respond to such changes  the uncertain timing of regulatory approvals  as well as other risks detailed in documents filed by us with the securities and exchange commission 
critical accounting policies and estimates as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an on going basis and adjusts as necessary to accurately reflect current conditions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on current and historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following are its critical accounting policies and estimates o revenue recognition we recognize revenue and all related costs  including warranty costs  when title and risk of loss passes to the customer and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
revenue is recognized for products shipped fob shipping point when they leave our premises 
revenue is recognized for products shipped fob destination when they reach the customer 
for certain products where we maintain consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time we are notified that the product has been used by the customer 
we record estimated sales returns as a reduction of net sales in the same period that the related revenue is recognized 
historical experience is used to estimate an accrual for future returns relating to recorded sales  as well as estimated warranty costs 
revenue for service repairs and maintenance is recognized after service has been completed  and service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
for certain products  revenue is recognized individually for delivered components when undelivered components  such as installation  are not essential to their functionality 
post shipment obligations for training commitments are considered perfunctory  and sales are recognized when delivered with provision for incremental costs 
o allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is used to state trade receivables at estimated net realizable value 
we rely on prior experience to estimate cash which ultimately will be collected from the gross receivables balance at period end 
such amount cannot be known with certainty at the financial statement date 
we maintain a specific allowance for customer accounts that will likely not be collectible due to customer liquidity issues 
we also maintain a general allowance for estimated future collection losses on existing receivables  determined based on historical trends 
o inventory valuation we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
inventory reserves are recorded to report inventory at its estimated fair market value 
a reserve is recorded for inventory specifically identified as slow moving or obsolete 
in addition  a general reserve is recorded based upon our historical experience with inventory becoming obsolete due to age  changes in technology and other factors 
o goodwill valuation goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized and is subject to the impairment rules of sfas no 
 which we adopted in the first quarter of fiscal goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment may exist 
we determine the fair market value of our reporting units using estimates of projected cash flows 
o income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions with different tax rates and must determine the allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on estimates and assumptions 
in the normal course of business  we will undergo scheduled reviews by taxing authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
tax reviews frequently require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
o pension plan actuarial assumptions we sponsor defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements 
we use several actuarial and other statistical factors which attempt to estimate the ultimate expense and liability related to our pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases 
in addition  our actuarial consultants also utilize subjective assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences  depending on their magnitude  could have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we record in any particular period 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends certain disclosure requirements of sfas no 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements prescribed by sfas no 
as of march  in january  the financial accounting standards boards issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate such entities 
in addition  fin requires that any enterprises with a significant variable interest in these types of entities make additional disclosures in all financial statements initially issued after january  the adoption of this interpretation did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is primarily effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
the new statement requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
most of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk due to the global nature of our operations  we are subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize net earnings volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency transactions which are primarily related to certain intercompany receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our hedging activities do not subject us to exchange rate risk because gains and losses on these contracts offset losses and gains on the assets  liabilities and transactions being hedged 
a portion of the net foreign transaction gain or loss is reported in our statement of consolidated earnings in cost of sales and the balance in other income and expense 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
none of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts are designated as economic hedges of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  no foreign currency transaction gains or losses were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for the years ended june   and as of june   we had a notional amount of million of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding  all of which were in euros and british pounds 
the foreign exchange forward contracts generally have maturities that do not exceed months and require us to exchange foreign currencies for united states dollars at maturity  at rates agreed to when the contract is signed
