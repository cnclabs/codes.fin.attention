item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion concerns fulton financial corporation the corporation  a financial holding company registered under the bank holding company act and incorporated under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania in  and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial information presented in this report 
forward looking statements the corporation has made  and may continue to make  certain forward looking statements with respect to acquisition and growth strategies  market risk  expenses  the effect of competition on net interest margin and net interest income  investment strategy and income growth  investment securities gains  other than temporary impairment of investment securities  deposit and loan growth  asset quality  balances of risk sensitive assets to risk sensitive liabilities  employee benefits and other expenses  amortization of goodwill and intangible assets and other financial and business matters for future periods 
the corporation cautions that these forward looking statements are subject to various assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
because of the possibility that the underlying assumptions may change  actual results could differ materially from these forward looking statements 
in addition to the factors identified herein  the following could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements pricing pressures on loan and deposit products  actions of bank and non bank competitors  changes in local and national economic conditions  changes in regulatory requirements  actions of the federal reserve board frb  creditworthiness of current borrowers and customers acceptance of the corporation s products and services 
the corporation s forward looking statements are relevant only as of the date on which such statements are made 
by making any forward looking statements  the corporation assumes no duty to update them to reflect new  changing or unanticipated events or circumstances 
critical accounting policies the following is a summary of those accounting policies that the corporation considers to be most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations as they require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
allowance and provision for loan losses the corporation accounts for the credit risk associated with its lending activities through the allowance and provision for loan losses 
the allowance is an estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
the provision is the periodic charge to earnings which is necessary to adjust the allowance to its proper balance 
on a quarterly basis  the corporation assesses the adequacy of its allowance through a methodology that consists of the following identifying large balance loans for individual review under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan statement 
in general  these consist of large balance commercial loans and commercial mortgages 
assessing whether the loans identified for review under statement are impaired 
that is  whether it is probable that all amounts will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for loans identified as impaired  calculating the estimated fair value  using observable market prices  discounted cash flows or the value of the underlying collateral 
classifying all non impaired large balance loans based on credit risk ratings and allocating an allowance for loan losses based on appropriate factors  including recent loss history for similar loans 
identifying all smaller balance homogeneous loans for evaluation collectively under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies statement 
in general  these loans include residential mortgages  consumer loans  installment loans  smaller balance commercial loans and mortgages and lease receivables 
statement loans are segmented into groups with similar characteristics and an allowance for loan losses is allocated to each segment based on recent loss history and other relevant information 
reviewing the results to determine the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses 
this review gives additional consideration to factors such as the mix of loans in the portfolio  the balance of the allowance relative to total loans and non performing assets  trends in the overall risk profile of the portfolio  trends in delinquencies and non accrual loans and local and national economic conditions 
an unallocated allowance is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss exposure 
documenting the results of its review in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues sab 
the allowance review methodology is based on information known at the time of the review 
changes in factors underlying the assessment could have a material impact on the amount of the allowance that is necessary and the amount of provision to be charged against earnings 
such changes could impact future results 
goodwill with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards nos 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement and  acquisitions of certain financial institutions statement  effective on january   the corporation discontinued the amortization of goodwill associated with qualifying acquisitions accounted for as purchases 
as of january   and at least annually thereafter  recorded goodwill is subject to impairment testing to determine whether write downs of the recorded balances are necessary 
the corporation tests for impairment by first allocating its goodwill and other assets and liabilities  as necessary  to defined reporting units 
a fair value is then determined for each reporting unit 
assuming that the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of the recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value is less than the book value  an additional test is necessary to assess the proper carrying value of the goodwill 
the corporation determined that no impairment write offs were necessary during business unit valuation is inherently subjective  with a number of factors based on assumptions and management judgments 
among these are future growth rates for the reporting units  discount rates and earnings capitalization rates 
changes in assumptions and results due to economic conditions  industry factors and reporting unit performance and cash flow projections could result in different assessments of the fair values of reporting units and could result in impairment charges in the future 
see further discussion of the impact of adopting statements and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
merger and acquisition activity the corporation has historically supplemented its internal growth with strategic acquisitions of banks  branches and other financial services companies 
to allow the reader to understand the impact of such acquisitions on its financial results  summaries of recent acquisitions follow

the core deposit intangible asset is being amortized over years 
with the adoption of statement on january   the unidentifiable intangible asset  which was being amortized on a straight line basis over years  was reclassified to goodwill and amortization was suspended 
as with all of the corporation s goodwill  this is being tested at least annually for impairment

the corporation s net interest income has been impacted by a series of reductions to short term interest rates enacted by the frb over the past two years 
these rate reductions resulted in significant decreases to the corporation s prime lending rate as well as a decline in the general interest rate environment 
the rate reductions initially had a negative impact on the corporation s net interest income and net interest margin as its assets  particularly floating rate loans  repriced to lower rates more quickly than its time deposits 
during  however  the corporation s longer term liabilities repriced to lower rates resulting in an increase to the corporation s net interest margin 
the positive impact of the time deposit repricing on the net interest margin peaked in mid the most recent rate cut by the frb in late contributed to a slight downward trend in the margin over the last quarter of if rates remain low in the future  the net interest margin may continue to trend lower 
vs 
in  net interest income was positively impacted by the full year impact of the branch acquisition  which provided approximately million in deposits and million in loans 
net interest income for the year was million  a million  or  increase over the net interest margin for was  an eight basis point increase from in interest income decreased million  or  mainly as a result of the basis point decrease in average yields which accounted for a million decline in interest income 
as previously discussed  average yields decreased during due to a general decrease in interest rates as a result of the actions of the frb 
the corporation s prime lending rate averaged in  dropping to an average of during the decrease in interest income as a result of rate changes was partially offset by a million increase due to average balance growth  primarily in investment securities 
average loans of billion were essentially flat for the period 
this was the result of several offsetting factors 
strong commercial loan and commercial mortgage growth million  or  increase in average balances was offset by decreases in residential mortgages million  or and consumer loans million  or 
residential mortgages decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment generating strong refinance activity 
newly originated fixed rate mortgages were sold in the secondary market to promote liquidity and reduce interest rate risk 
consumer loans decreased mainly in direct and indirect automobile loans million  or due to the corporation electing not to compete with manufacturer sponsored loan rate incentives and consumers paying off such consumer debt with cash from mortgage refinances 
these decreases were offset in part by an increase in home equity loans million  or  as consumers took advantage of the lower rates available on these loans 
the average yield on loans during was  a basis point decline from the reduction in the corporation s average prime lending rate resulted in lower overall yields as compared to the corporation also experienced a shift of approximately million from fixed rate to adjustable rate commercial loan and commercial mortgage balances 
average investment securities increased million  or  during the increase was mainly the result of deposit growth exceeding net increases in loans 
total average deposits increased million  or  during the corporation used the excess funds to purchase investment securities  particularly mortgage backed securities  which grew by million  or 
the average yield on investment securities declined during  although the reduction was not as pronounced as that realized on the loan portfolio 
the average yield on investments was in and in interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in this resulted from a combination of declining interest rates and a shift in the composition of liabilities from higher rate time deposits to lower rate demand and savings deposits 
interest bearing demand and savings deposits increased million  or  and noninterest bearing deposits increased million  or  while time deposits decreased by million  or 
the branch acquisition contributed million to the increase in average deposits 
the net million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities actually resulted in a million decrease in interest expense  due to the change in the composition of these liabilities 
the basis point decline in the average cost of interest bearing funds resulted in a million decrease in interest expense 
average short term borrowings increased million  or 
this additional source of funds was partially used to reduce the corporation s higher rate long term borrowings in the early part of average long term debt decreased million  or  from million in to million in average interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in as compared to in this change was more pronounced than the basis point decrease in yields on average interest earning assets  resulting in an increase in the corporation s net interest margin of eight basis points to in from in vs 
in  net interest income was also positively impacted by the june  branch acquisition 
net interest income for the year was million  a million  or  increase over the net interest margin for was  a four basis point decrease from in interest income decreased  or  to million in from million in interest income increased million as a result of a million increase in average interest earning assets  however  this was more than offset by a million reduction resulting from declining rates 
the average yield on earning assets for the year dropped basis points to in from in average loans increased million  or  to billion 
excluding the impact of the purchase acquisitions  the increase was million  or 
this modest increase resulted from the same offsetting trends which continued into strong commercial loan and commercial mortgage growth million  or offset by a million  or  decrease in residential mortgages and a million  or  decrease in consumer loans 
residential mortgages decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment generating increased refinance activity and the sale of the resulting fixed rate mortgage loans 
consumer loans decreased mainly in indirect and direct automobile loans 
the average yield on loans during was  a basis point decline from  which mirrored the decline in average rates on total interest earning assets 
the interest rate reductions enacted by the frb had a direct impact on the corporation s prime lending rate  which declined to an average of during as compared to in this resulted in lower overall yields as compared to average investment securities increased million  or  during this growth resulted from the branch acquisition  where the excess of deposits assumed over loans acquired was approximately million 
a portion of these excess funds was used to purchase investment securities as the corporation realized only modest loan growth 
the average yield on investment securities also declined during to compared to in interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in unlike interest income  which was equally impacted by rates and volumes  the decrease in interest expense was mainly a result of decreases in rates million  somewhat offset by increases in balances million 
this contrast resulted from short term borrowings and demand and savings deposits repricing to lower rates more quickly than earning assets 
average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  to billion in this increase was largely driven by the purchase acquisitions  excluding these acquisitions  the increase was million  or 
all categories of deposits realized growth during while uncertainty in the equity markets contributed to the inflow of funds to fdic insured institutions  the corporation also benefited from its marketing campaigns promoting core deposit growth 
average demand deposits  excluding the impact of the purchase acquisitions  increased million  or  and average savings deposits increased million  or 
time deposits increased million  or 
average short term borrowings decreased million  or  as excess funds from the branch acquisition were used to reduce short term borrowings as well as to purchase investment securities 
long term debt increased million  or  as the corporation retained positions in longer term debt for balance sheet management purposes 
average interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to in as compared to in this change was comparable to the change in interest earning assets  thus minimizing the impact of rates on the corporation s net interest margin for the year  which decreased only four basis points to in from in provision and allowance for loan losses the credit risk associated with lending activities is accounted for by the corporation through its allowance and provision for loan losses 
the provision is the expense recognized in the income statement to adjust the allowance to its proper balance  as determined through the application of the corporation s allowance methodology procedures 
these procedures include the evaluation of the risk characteristics of the portfolio and documentation in accordance with sab see critical accounting policies on page for a discussion of the corporation s allowance for loan loss evaluation methodology

the following table presents the aggregate amount of non accrual and past due loans and other real estate owned december in thousands non accrual loans      accruing loans past due days or more 
     other real estate     totals      as of december   the gross interest income that would have been recorded during if nonaccrual loans had been current in accordance with their original terms was approximately million 
the amount of interest income on those nonaccrual loans that was included in income was approximately  accrual of interest is generally discontinued when a loan becomes days past due as to principal and interest 
when interest accruals are discontinued  interest credited to income is reversed 
nonaccrual loans are restored to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest becomes current or the loan is considered secured and in the process of collection 
certain loans  primarily residential mortgages  that are determined to be sufficiently collateralized may continue to accrue interest after reaching days past due 
excluded from the amounts presented at december  are million in loans where possible credit problems of borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type december dollars in thousands of of of of of loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in each each each each each allowance category allowance category allowance category allowance category allowance category comm l  financial agriculture 
     real estate construction mortgages      consumer  leasing other      unallocated      totals      the provision for loan losses for totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million in in the corporation provided an additional million related to the drovers bank acquisition 
excluding this additional amount  the provision for loan losses was unchanged from year to year 
the provision  as adjusted for the million  was million  or  lower than the amount of million 
the higher provision was primarily related to specific asset quality issues experienced by drovers prior to the acquisition 
over the past several years  the procedures used by the banking industry to evaluate the allowance for loan losses have received increased attention from the securities and exchange commission  regulatory bodies and the accounting industry 
these groups have attempted to reconcile the accounting theory of reserving for loan losses  which requires that the allowance represent management s estimate of the losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date  with the regulatory goals of safety and soundness 
while the resulting guidance provided by these groups has not changed the accounting  it has focused on clarifying the application of statements and and improving documentation 
as with others in the industry  the corporation has used this guidance to improve its process and its documentation 
the unallocated allowance for loan losses  as shown in the above table  decreased from million  or of the total allowance  to million  or of the total allowance  in the past year 
this decrease is not necessarily indicative of changes in the underlying credit quality  but is rather the result of refinements in the corporation s methodology that have not been retroactively applied to prior years 
whereas in prior years  there was no effort to assign the unallocated allowance to the components of the loan portfolio for which these additional balances were maintained  this was done in as part of these refinements 
a significant portion of the unallocated allowance was attributed to commercial  financial and agricultural loans in recognition of the risk characteristics of this portfolio 
these characteristics include  among other things  larger loans which may be unsecured or partially secured and loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty but continues to meet principal and interest obligations 
non performing assets increased million  or  as compared to  representing a three basis point increase as a percentage of total assets in and in 
despite recent economic uncertainties  this moderate increase has resulted from specific  individual credits and is not indicative of a general worsening trend in the corporation s asset quality 
the balance includes a million loan to a developer of commercial and residential projects in a geographic area that had been impacted by drought conditions 
the original amount of this relationship that was placed on non accrual status in the third quarter of was approximately million 
subsequently  million of this account was paid off  resulting in a million charge off 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were  a two basis point increase from as with the non performing ratios  this increase resulted mainly from the specific credit noted in the preceding paragraph 
excluding this credit  the corporation realized positive trends in net charge offs as net consumer loan charge offs  which historically have accounted for the largest amount of losses  decreased from million  or of average consumer loans outstanding  in to million  or of average consumer loans outstanding 
the provision for loan losses in resulted from the corporation s allowance allocation procedures 
trends that would indicate the need for a higher provision include the general national and regional economies and the continued growth in the corporation s commercial loan and commercial mortgage portfolios  which are inherently more risky 
offsetting these trends were the improvements in quality of the corporation s other loan types and consistency of asset quality measures over the past several years 
the net result of the corporation s allowance allocation procedures was a provision for loan losses that was essentially unchanged from and was comparable to total net charge offs for the year 
management believes that the allowance balance of million at december  is sufficient to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio on that date and is appropriate based on applicable accounting standards 
other income other income for was million  an increase of million  or  over other income of million in excluding investment securities gains  which decreased million to million in  other income increased million  or 
increases were realized across all categories of other income 
excluding investment securities gains  other income increased million  or  in in terms of total dollar increases  the most significant growth in each year was realized in mortgage banking income  which increased million  or  to million in  following an increase of million  or  in the declining interest rate environment over the past two years fueled significant residential mortgage refinance activity  resulting in increases in gains on sales 
the corporation s policy is to sell qualifying originated fixed rate mortgage loans and retain the servicing in order to minimize interest rate risk and improve liquidity 
also contributing to the growth in other income was the increase in service charges on deposit accounts  which increased million  or  in and million  or  in the increase in each year was attributable to the branch acquisition as well as strong growth in transaction accounts 
service charges on deposit accounts include overdraft fees  which increased million  or  and cash management fees  which increased million  or investment management and trust services income grew million  or  in and million  or  in trust commission income decreased  or  in as a result of poor equity market performance impacting the market value of assets under management 
this decrease was offset by a million  or  increase in brokerage revenue 
in  the increase resulted from the acquisition of dearden maguire 
other service charges and fees increased million  or  in and million  or  in increases in each year resulted mainly from debit card revenues as usage of this product increased 
other income increased million to million in as result of the reversal of  of negative goodwill   in gains on fixed assets and an increase in earnings on the corporation s life insurance contracts 
investment securities gains decreased million  or  to million in  following an increase of million  or  in the decrease in resulted from the general performance of the equity markets 
other expenses total other expenses for increased million  or  to million 
this followed a increase of million  or  to million 
other expenses in included million in merger related expenses 
excluding these one time charges  other expenses increased million  or  in the corporation s efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expenses excluding intangible amortization to fully taxable equivalent revenues excluding securities gains improved to in  as compared to in and in salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  in to million  as compared to a million  or  increase to million in the salary expense component increased million  or  in  driven by salary increases for existing employees as well as an increase in the total number of employees 
total average full time equivalent employees were  in as compared to  in and  in employee benefits increased million  or  driven mainly by continued increases in health insurance costs million  or and retirement plan expenses million  or 
the corporation maintains two primary retirement plans  a defined contribution profit sharing plan and a defined benefit plan  which has been closed to new participants 
in general  the expense for the profit sharing plan is a function of salary expense  while the defined benefit plan expense is actuarially determined 
defined benefit plan expense increased from  in to million in this trend is expected to continue into  with a projected increase of to million 
this expense is greatly impacted by the return realized on invested plan assets 
with the recent downturn in the equity markets  these returns have lagged the growth in the projected benefit obligation  resulting in an increase in expense 
if this trend continues  the corporation s expense may continue to grow 
for more details on retirement plan expense  see note m employee benefits plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net occupancy expense increased  or  to million in  following a increase of million  or 
while occupancy expense increased in as a result of additional branches and new office space  the rate of increase was less than due to the divestiture of certain properties acquired in the drovers acquisition and the consolidation of overlapping branch locations 
equipment expense decreased million  or  in following an increase of  or  in as with occupancy expense  the corporation realized a full year s impact in of efficiencies related to drovers 
furthermore  depreciation expense decreased as certain equipment purchased in the late s to address year concerns became fully depreciated 
data processing expense increased  or  in  compared to an increase of  or  in in  the corporation s contract with its third party loan and deposit processor was renegotiated  resulting in savings to the corporation 
as the corporation grew during and through the addition of new affiliates and branches  the resulting processing volume increases have generated moderate increases in data processing costs 
the expense also included redundant processing functions related to drovers which have since been merged 
advertising expense increased  or in  following a  or  increase in increases in both years resulted mainly from an image campaign for the corporation s lead bank 
goodwill and intangible amortization consists of the amortization of goodwill  unidentifiable intangible assets related to branch acquisitions and core deposit intangible assets 
in  intangible amortization decreased million  or  due to the non amortization of goodwill in accordance with statements and see note f goodwill and intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other expense increased million  or  in  to million  following an increase of million  or  in in  this was due to a  or  increase in operating risk losses related to overdrafts and robberies  and a  or  increase in pennsylvania bank shares taxes due to growth 
in  the increase was due to an increase in bank shares taxes million  or  increase due to fewer tax credits on qualified contributions 
the remaining increases of in and in reflected the continued growth of the corporation 
income taxes income taxes increased million  or  in to million  following an increase of million  or  in the effective tax rates income taxes divided by income before income taxes were  and in  and  respectively 
in general  the variances from the federal statutory rate consisted of tax exempt interest income and investments in low and moderate income housing partnerships  which qualify for federal tax credits 
net credits of million  million and million were recognized in  and  respectively 
the corporation s state income tax expense increased million  to million in  from  in as a result of legislative changes to the tax code in the state of new jersey

financial condition during  a number of trends affected the composition of the balance sheet 
first  unsettled equity markets and low rates drove a million  or  increase in demand and savings deposits as fdic insured deposits became more attractive and consumers avoided locking long term rates on time deposits 
second  low rates generated unprecedented mortgage refinance volumes  resulting in a runoff of existing residential mortgage loans  which more than offset increases in commercial loans and resulted in a net decrease to loans of approximately million 
third  an approximately million change in the mix of the loan portfolio from fixed rate to floating rate loans occurred  which trended the corporation toward greater asset sensitivity to interest rate changes 
to address these trends  the corporation used funds generated to purchase investment securities and reduce rate sensitivity for assets among both short term and longer term instruments 
in addition  to take advantage of the low interest rate environment  the corporation locked in longer term funding rates through the use of advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb  which increased million  or 
finally  short term borrowings through the use of federal funds purchased million  or  increase were used to match the increasing short term sensitivity of the loan portfolio 
as a result of these actions  the corporation s six month interest rate gap position  which is defined as total assets to total liabilities subject to repricing during the period and is one of the measures used to assess interest rate sensitivity  was at december  see the market risk section on page for a further discussion of the corporation s asset liability management practices

management periodically sells bank stocks when  in its opinion  valuations and market conditions warrant such sales 
premises and equipment premises and equipment decreased million  or  in to million  following a million  or  increase in the decrease in was mainly due to the full year of depreciation recognized on the new office space and operations facilities which were placed in service in  as well as excess branch and other properties disposed of during and the increase in was due to the addition of the new office space and operations facilities and continued investments in technology 
cash and due from banks cash and due from banks decreased million  or  to million in  following a million  or  increase in because of the daily fluctuations which result in the normal course of business  cash is more appropriately analyzed in terms of average balances 
on an average balance basis  cash and due from banks increased million  or  from million in to million in following a million  or increase in the increases in both years resulted from growth in the corporation s branch network 
other assets other assets  including accrued interest receivable and goodwill and intangible assets  decreased million  or  in to million  following a million  or  increase in the net decrease in was mainly due to a million  or  decrease in the net deferred federal income tax asset as a result of an increase in the unrealized gains on investment securities 
the net increase in resulted from goodwill and intangible assets recorded for dearden maguire million and the branch acquisition million 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in the net deferred tax asset due to an increase in unrealized gains on investment securities and an million decrease in accumulated cash surrender value as the corporation reduced its position in certain insurance investments 
the corporation continued to increase its participation in affordable housing and community development projects through investments in partnerships 
equity commitments of million were made to three new projects in the corporation made its initial investment of this type during and is now involved in projects  all located in the communities served by its subsidiary banks 
the carrying value of these investments was approximately million at december  with these investments  the corporation not only improves the quantity and quality of available housing for low income individuals in support of its banks community reinvestment act compliance effort  but also becomes eligible for tax credits under federal and  in some cases  state programs 
deposits and borrowings deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  this compares to an increase of million  or  in million  or  excluding the branch acquisition 
the recent trend has been moderate internal growth in deposit funding  supplemented by acquisitions 
the difference between the two years has been the mix of the growth 
demand and savings deposits increased million and million  respectively  while time deposits decreased million during this reflects a general mood in the financial community whereby consumers are reluctant to reinvest maturing time deposits at the current low rates

many of the trends experienced during began in when the frb started its series of rate cuts 
short term borrowings  which consist mainly of federal funds purchased and customer cash management accounts  increased million  or  during after decreasing million  or  in the increase in resulted from the previously mentioned actions taken to manage the corporation s gap position due to the movement of loans from fixed to floating rates 
the decrease resulted from the branch acquisition funds  which were used to reduce short term borrowings and to purchase investment securities since net loans were unchanged

in  shareholders equity increased million  or 
this higher growth rate in reflects fewer treasury stock purchases 
the corporation periodically implements stock repurchase plans for various corporate purposes 
in addition to evaluating the financial benefits of implementing repurchase plans  management also considers liquidity needs  the current market price per share and relevant accounting and regulatory issues 
repurchase plans were significantly limited during periods when the corporation accounted for acquisitions using pooling of interests accounting 
with statement requiring the use of purchase accounting  the accounting constraints on repurchase plans no longer exist 
the corporation accounted for the acquisition of drovers under the pooling of interests method of accounting  which would normally preclude it from repurchasing its own stock for a period following the acquisition 
in an effort to stabilize equity markets following the terrorist attacks on september   the us securities and exchange commission temporarily suspended the restrictions on treasury stock purchases 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the corporation acquired  shares of its stock 
on january   the board of directors approved a plan to repurchase up to million shares of the corporation s common stock through june  the plan was subsequently extended to december  
stock repurchased was added to the corporate treasury to be used for general corporate purposes 
during  the corporation repurchased million shares under these plans 
on december   the board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million shares through june  the corporation and its subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking regulators 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
the regulations require that banks maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and tier i capital to average assets as defined 
as of december   the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries met the minimum capital requirements 
in addition  the corporation and each of its bank subsidiaries capital ratios exceeded the amounts required to be considered well capitalized as defined in the regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to economic loss that arises from changes in the values of certain financial instruments 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by financial institutions include interest rate risk  equity market price risk  foreign currency risk and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of its operations  only equity market price risk and interest rate risk are significant to the corporation 
equity market price risk equity market price risk is the risk that changes in the values of equity investments could have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations of the corporation 
the corporation s equity investments consist primarily of common stocks of publicly traded financial institutions cost basis of approximately million  fair value of million at december  
the corporation s financial institutions stock had gross unrealized gains of approximately million at december  although the carrying value of equity investments accounted for only of the corporation s total assets  the unrealized gains on the portfolio represent a potential source of revenue 
the corporation has a history of periodically realizing gains from this portfolio and  if values were to decline significantly  this revenue source could be lost 
management continuously monitors the fair value of its equity investments and evaluates current market conditions and operating results of the companies 
periodic sale and purchase decisions are made based on this monitoring process 
none of the corporation s equity securities are classified as trading 
future cash flows from these investments are not provided in the table on page as such investments do not have maturity dates 
certain of the corporation s equity investments have shown negative returns in tandem with the general performance of equity markets 
the corporation has evaluated  based on current accounting guidance  whether the decreases in value of any of these investments constitute other than temporary impairment which would require a write down through a charge to earnings 
in  the corporation recorded a write down of  for specific equity securities which were deemed to exhibit other than temporary impairment in value 
if the performance of certain equity securities does not improve over the next twelve months  additional impairment charges may be necessary 
in addition to its equity portfolio  the corporation s investment management and trust services revenue could be impacted by fluctuations in the securities markets 
a portion of the corporation s trust revenue is based on the value of the underlying investment portfolios 
if securities markets contract  the corporation s revenue could be negatively impacted 
in addition  the ability of the corporation to sell its brokerage services is dependent upon consumers level of confidence in the outlook for rising securities prices 
interest rate risk and asset liability management interest rate risk creates exposure in two primary areas 
first  changes in rates have an impact on the corporation s liquidity position and could affect its ability to meet obligations and continue to grow 
second  movements in interest rates can create fluctuations in the corporation s net income and changes in the economic value of its equity 
the corporation employs various management techniques to minimize its exposure to interest rate risk 
an asset liability management committee alco  consisting of key financial and senior management personnel  meets on a weekly basis 
the alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation  approving asset and liability management policies  and overseeing the formulation and implementation of strategies regarding balance sheet positions and earnings 
the primary goal of asset liability management is to address the liquidity and net income risks noted above 
from a liquidity standpoint  the corporation must maintain a sufficient level of liquid assets to meet the ongoing cash flow requirements of customers  who  as depositors  may want to withdraw funds or who  as borrowers  need credit availability 
liquidity sources are found on both sides of the balance sheet 
liquidity is provided on a continuous basis through scheduled and unscheduled principal reductions and interest payments on outstanding loans and investments 
liquidity is also provided through the availability of deposits and borrowings 
at december   liquid assets defined as cash and due from banks  short term investments  mortgages available for sale  securities available for sale  and non mortgage backed securities held to maturity due in one year or less totaled billion  or of total assets 
this compares to billion  or of total assets  at december  the following tables set forth the maturities of investment securities at december  and the weighted average yields of such securities calculated based on historical cost 
held to maturity at amortized cost maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government and agency securities   state and municipal    other securities totals    mortgage backed securities  available for sale at estimated fair value maturing after one but after five but within one year within five years within ten years after ten years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us government and agency securities   state and municipal     other securities totals     mortgage backed securities  weighted average yields on tax exempt securities have been computed on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate of percent 
maturities for mortgage backed securities are dependent upon the interest rate environment and prepayments on the underlying loans 
for the purpose of this table  the entire balance and weighted average rate is shown in one period 
the corporation s investment portfolio consists mainly of mortgage backed securities  which do not have stated maturities 
liquidity from such investments is a function of interest rates  as rates increase  cash flows generally decrease as prepayments on the underlying mortgage loans slow 
as rates decrease  cash flows generally increase as prepayments increase 
the following table summarizes the approximate contractual maturity and sensitivity of certain loan types  excluding consumer loans and leases  to changes in interest rates as of december  one one year through more than or less five years five years total in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural floating rate     fixed rate     total     real estate mortgage floating rate     fixed rate     total     real estate construction floating rate     fixed rate     total     from a funding standpoint  the corporation has been able to rely over the years on a stable base of core deposits 
even though the corporation has experienced notable changes in the composition and interest sensitivity of this deposit base  it has been able to rely on this base to provide needed liquidity 
the corporation also has access to sources of large denomination or jumbo time deposits and repurchase agreements as potential sources of liquidity 
however  the corporation has attempted to minimize its reliance upon these more volatile short term funding sources and to use them primarily to meet the requirements of its existing customer base or when it is profitable to do so 
maturities of time deposits of  or more outstanding at december  are summarized as follows time deposits or more in thousands three months or less  over three through six months  over six through twelve months  over twelve months  total  each of the corporation s subsidiary banks is a member of the fhlb and has access to fhlb overnight and term credit facilities 
at december   the corporation had million in term advances from the fhlb with an additional billion of borrowing capacity including both short term funding on its lines of credit and long term borrowings 
this availability  along with federal funds lines at various correspondent commercial banks  provides the corporation with additional liquidity

amounts are federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase  which mature in less than days 
the preceding table and discussion addressed the liquidity implications of interest rate risk and focused on expected contractual cash flows from financial instruments 
expected maturities  however  do not necessarily estimate the net income impact of interest rate changes 
certain financial instruments  such as adjustable rate loans  have repricing periods that differ from expected cash flows 
the corporation uses three complementary methods to measure and manage interest rate risk 
they are static gap analysis  simulation of earnings  and estimates of economic value of equity 
using these measurements in tandem provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the magnitude of interest rate risk in the corporation  level of risk as time evolves  and exposure to changes in interest rates 
static gap provides a measurement of repricing risk in the corporation s balance sheet as of a point in time 
this measurement is accomplished through stratification of the corporation s assets and liabilities into repricing periods 
the assets and liabilities in each of these periods are compared for mismatches within that maturity segment 
core deposits having noncontractual maturities are placed into repricing periods based upon historical balance performance 
repricing for mortgage loans and for mortgage backed securities includes the effect of expected cash flows 
estimated prepayment effects are applied to these balances based upon industry projections for prepayment speeds 
the corporation s policy limits the cumulative month gap to plus or minus of total earning assets 
the cumulative month gap as of december  was 
the following is a summary of the interest sensitivity gaps for three different time intervals as of december  days days days gap cumulative gap 
simulation of net interest income and of net income is performed for the next twelve month period 
a variety of interest rate scenarios is used to measure the effects of sudden and gradual movements upward and downward in the yield curve 
these results are compared to the results obtained in a flat or unchanged interest rate scenario 
simulation of earnings is used primarily to measure the corporation s short term earnings exposure to rate movements 
the corporation s policy limits the potential exposure of net interest income to of the base case net interest income for every basis point shock in interest rates 
a shock is an immediate upward or downward movement of interest rates across the yield curve based upon changes in the prime rate 
the following table summarizes the expected impact of interest rate shocks on net interest income due to the current low rates  only the basis shock in a downward scenario is shown annual change in net interest rate shock income change bp million bp million bp million bp million economic value of equity estimates the discounted present value of asset cash flows and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for like assets and liabilities 
upward and downward shocks of interest rates are used to determine the comparative effect of such interest rate movements relative to the unchanged environment 
this measurement tool is used primarily to evaluate the longer term repricing risks and options in the corporation s balance sheet 
a policy limit of of economic equity may be at risk for every basis point shock movement in interest rates
