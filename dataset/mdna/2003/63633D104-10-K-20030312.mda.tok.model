item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of the financial statements 
impaired properties include foreclosure properties in washington state  massachusetts  new hampshire  kansas and missouri 
nhi operates these properties and has included the operating revenues and expenses of these facilities in the statements of income since obtaining possession 
nhc has been retained to manage these properties 
we are treating these properties as foreclosure properties for federal income tax purposes with certain elections  unqualified income generated by the properties is expected to be treated as qualified income for up to six years from the purchase date for purposes of the income source tests that must be satisfied by reits to maintain their tax status 
remic certificate valuations on november   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a remic in the form of nine classes of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
on december   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit remic in the form of one class of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
on november   nhi purchased for  a participating interest in a remic in the form of nine classes of certificates issued in the aggregate principal amount of  the remic 
both of the remics represent the entire beneficial ownership interest in a trust fund 
each trust fund consists of pools of mortgage loans  each secured by a first lien on a property that is used in providing long term nursing care and certain other assets 
pursuant to sfas  nhi has classified its investments in the certificates as held to maturity debt securities 
accordingly  the investments in the certificates have been recorded at the amortized cost in our consolidated financial statements 
the effective yields  as calculated  have been used to accrue income based on actual and projected future cash flows that reflect actual and assumed mortgage prepayments and interest rates 
remic during  we were informed by the servicer of the remic that mariner health care mariner and one of the borrowers within the remic had declared bankruptcy and was not making the required debt service payments 
as a result  we wrote off  of the remic value 
at december   the net carrying value of the remic is  prior to  we received  of interest payments from the master servicer of the remic that was not recorded as interest income during those periods because of a potential repayment obligation to the servicer of the remic 
however  in may  mariner reached a settlement with the servicer of the remic  made payments missed in prior periods  and began making principal and interest payments in june as a result  nhi s repayment obligation was reduced by  resulting in the recognition of  of interest income during and leaving no repayment obligation related to the remic at december remic at december   the net carrying value of the remic is  prior to  we received  of interest payments from the servicer of the remic that was not recorded as interest income during those periods because of a repayment obligation to the servicer of the remic 
during  we received  of additional payments from the servicer of the remic that initially was not recorded as interest income 
subsequently  in  based on information received from the servicer of the remic  we reversed a reserve for advances of  resulting in income recorded during of  related to repayment obligations of the remic 
as of december   we have a repayment obligation remaining of  to the servicer of the remic 
quarterly  we monitor the carrying amounts of the and remic investments based on actual cash payments received and revised cash flow projections that reflect updated assumptions about collectibility  interest rates and prepayment rates 
in the opinion of management  no other impairments of the carrying amounts have occurred as of december  loan  realty and security loss during  we determined  based on events occurring during that year and based on the provisions of sfas and sfas  that impairments of certain of the investments mentioned above had occurred 
as discussed above  these investments were affected by bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings  non receipt of payments and judgments about possible refinancing and other collateral values 
at december   we determined that no allowance for loan losses was required 
loan loss provisions and property impairments of  have been recorded during related to six mortgage loans totaling  before writedowns 
the remaining portion of the loan  realty and security loss of  relates to the write down in for the other than temporary impairment in value of ltc properties  inc common stock 
it is possible that additional events could occur that would indicate a further impairment of the net carrying amount of our investments 
if such events occur  we will record additional loan loss provisions and impairment losses in the periods such events are known 
commitments we have received commitment fees to make loans and to fund construction in progress to third parties for million 
commitments include construction financings which have closed but which have not been fully funded as of december  and also investment amounts for which we have received a commitment fee but which have not been funded as of december  the following table sets forth certain information regarding our commitments as of december  commitments facility type facilities current future total in thousands long term care assisted living 

commitments sources of revenues general 
our revenues are derived primarily from mortgage interest income  rental income and the operation of foreclosure properties 
during  mortgage interest income equaled million of which all except 
million was from non nhc borrowers 
rental income totaled million  of which was from properties operated by nhc 
the interest and rental payments are primarily derived from the operations of the health care facilities 
the source and amount of revenues from such operations are determined by i the licensed bed or other capacity of the health care facilities  ii the occupancy rate of the health care facilities  iii the extent to which the services provided at each health care facility are utilized by the patients  iv the mix of private pay  medicare and medicaid patients at the health care facilities  and v the rates paid by private paying patients and by the medicare and medicaid programs 
facility operating revenues are derived from the operations of the foreclosure properties and are determined by similar factors 
governmental and popular concerns regarding health care costs have and may continue to result in significant reductions in payments to health care facilities  and there can be no assurance that future payment rates for either governmental or private health care plans will be sufficient to cover cost increases in providing services to patients 
any changes in reimbursement policies which reduce reimbursement to levels that are insufficient to cover the cost of providing patient care have and could continue to adversely affect revenues of our health related lessees and borrowers and thereby adversely affect those lessees and borrowers abilities to make their lease or debt payments to us 
failure of the lessees or borrowers to make their lease or debt payments would have a direct and material adverse impact on us 
medicare and medicaid 
a significant portion of the revenue of our foreclosure properties and our lessees and borrowers is derived from governmental funded reimbursement programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
medicare is a federal health insurance program under the social security act for individuals age and over and certain chronically disabled individuals 
the balanced budget act of bba made fundamental changes in the medicare program which have resulted in reduced levels of payment for a substantial portion of health care services 
amendments to the bba medicare enactments were made in late and late  which have enhanced operating revenues at medicare certified lessees and borrowers 
medicaid is a joint federal and state program designed to provide medical assistance to medically indigent persons 
these programs are operated by state agencies which adopt their own medical reimbursement formula and standards  and rates and covered services vary from state to state 
however  in many instances  revenues from medicaid programs are insufficient to cover the actual costs incurred in providing care to those patients 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes resulting from legislation  adoption of rules and regulations  and administrative and judicial interpretations of existing law 
moreover  health care facilities have experienced increasing pressures from private payors attempting to control health care costs  and reimbursement from private payors has in many cases effectively been reduced to levels approaching those of government payors 
governmental funding of medicare and medicaid 
government at both the federal and state levels has continued in its efforts to reduce  or at least limit the growth of  spending for health care services  including services to be provided by our lessee s or their operators 
the bba was enacted in august   which contained numerous medicare and medicaid cost saving measures  as well as new anti fraud provisions 
the bba was projected to save billion in medicare spending over the next five years  and billion in the medicaid program 
section of the bba  entitled flexibility in payment methods for hospital  nursing facility  icf mr  and home health services  repealed the boren amendment  which has required that state medicaid programs pay to nursing home providers amounts adequate to enable them to meet government quality and safety standards  the boren amendment was previously the foundation of litigation by nursing homes seeking rate increases 
in place of the boren amendment  the bba requires only that  for services and items furnished on or after october   a state medicaid program must provide for a public process for determination of medicaid rates of payment for nursing facility services  under which proposed rates  the methodologies underlying the establishment of such rates  and justifications for the proposed rates are published  and which give providers  beneficiaries and other concerned state residents a reasonable opportunity for review and comment on the proposed rates  methodologies and justifications 
several of the states in which we have assets are actively seeking ways to reduce medicaid spending for nursing home care by such methods as capitated payments and substantial reductions in reimbursement rates 
the bba also required that nursing homes transition to a prospective payment system under the medicare program during a three year transition period commencing with the first cost reporting period beginning on or after july  substantially all of the health care facilities in which we have invested commenced reimbursement under this program effective january  we believe that the deduction in medicare revenues have negatively impacted our additional percentage rent and  in the case of renegotiated rents for troubled properties  the base rent of our skilled nursing facilities 
the bba also contains several new antifraud provisions 
given the recent enactment of the bba  we are unable to predict the impact of the bba and its potential changes in state medicaid reimbursement methodologies on the operations of its tenants or borrowers  however  any significant reduction in either medicare or medicaid payments could adversely affect their cash flows 
changes in certification and participation requirements of the medicare and medicaid programs have restricted  and are likely to continue to restrict further  eligibility for reimbursement under those programs 
failure to obtain and maintain medicare and medicaid certification by our tenants or borrowers would result in denial of medicare and medicaid payments which could result in a significant loss of revenue to those providers 
in addition  private payors  including managed care payors  increasingly are demanding that providers accept discounted fees or assume all or a portion of the financial risk for the delivery of health care services 
such measures may include capitated payments whereby the provider is responsible for providing  for a fixed fee  all services needed by certain patients 
capitated payments can result in significant losses if patients require expensive treatment not adequately covered by the capitated rate 
efforts to impose reduced payments  greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors are expected to continue 
any reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our tenants or borrowers 
we are unable to predict what reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be adopted in the future or the effect such changes will have on its operations 
no assurance can be given that such reforms will not have a material adverse effect on us  however  we believe the most material negative impact occurred during congress addressed this financial distress in the fall of through enactment of the balanced budget refinement act bbra 
in  congress adjusted further the payment rates to skilled nursing facilities under the benefits improvement and protection act bipa 
the bbra included a percent across the board increase in payments to skilled nursing facilities for fiscal years and and a temporary percent increase to resource utilization groups rugs for patients considered medically complex 
these changes became effective on october  the bipa increased the inflation update to the full market basket in fiscal year and raised the nursing component of the rugs by percent in an effort to improve pps nursing staff ratios 
additionally  the bipa spread the bbra percent increase to the three rehabilitation rugs across all special rehabilitation rugs as a percent increase 
the other rugs changed in the bbra maintained the percent increase 
these changes went into effect on april  the improvements brought about by bbra and bipa including the percent across the board increase in rug payments  the percent increase in nursing component  the changes in the snf market basket  and the percent rugs add ons all expired on september  the actuary for the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms estimates that the combined effect of the expiration of these improvements would translate into a reduction of per medicare patient day 
these changes will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations on our foreclosure properties and the operations of our borrowers and lessees 
licensure and certification 
the health care industry is highly regulated by federal  state and local law  and is directly affected by state and local licensing requirements  facility inspections  state and federal reimbursement policies  regulations concerning capital and other expenditures  certification requirements  and other such laws  regulations and rules 
sanctions for failure to comply with these regulations and laws include but are not limited to loss of licensure  fines  and loss of certification to participate in the medicare and medicaid programs  as well as potential criminal penalties 
the failure of any lessee or borrower to comply with such laws  requirements and regulations could affect its ability to operate the facility or facilities and could adversely affect such lessee s or borrower s ability to make lease or debt payments to us 
in the past several years  due to rising health care costs  there has been an increased emphasis on detecting and eliminating fraud and abuse in the medicare and medicaid programs 
payment of any consideration in exchange for referral of medicare and medicaid patients is generally prohibited by federal statute  which subjects violators to severe penalties  including exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs  fines  and even prison sentences 
in recent years  both federal and state governments have significantly increased investigation and enforcement activity to detect and punish wrongdoers 
in addition  legislation has been adopted at both state and federal levels which severely restricts the ability of physicians to refer patients to entities in which they have a financial interest 
it is anticipated that the trend toward increased investigation and enforcement activity in the area of fraud and abuse  as well as self referral  will continue in future years 
certain of our investments are with lessees or borrowers which are partially or wholly owned by physicians 
in the event that any lessee or borrower were to be found in violation of laws regarding fraud and abuse or self referral  that lessee s or borrower s ability to operate the facility as a health care facility could be jeopardized  which could adversely affect the lessee s or borrower s ability to make lease or debt payments to us and thereby adversely affect us 
certificates of need 
certain health care facilities in which we invest are also generally subject to state statutes which may require regulatory approval  in the form of a certificate of need con prior to the addition or construction of new beds  the addition of services or certain capital expenditures 
con requirements are not uniform throughout the united states and are subject to change 
we cannot predict the impact of regulatory changes with respect to con s on the operations of our lessees and mortgagees  however  in our primary market areas  a significant reduction in new construction of long term care beds has occurred 
investment policies our investment objectives are i to provide current income for distribution to our stockholders through investments primarily in health care related facilities  ii to provide the opportunity to realize capital growth resulting from appreciation  if any  in the residual value of our portfolio properties  and iii to preserve and protect stockholders capital 
there can be no assurance that these objectives will be realized 
it is not our intention to sell our properties and reinvest in other investments for the purpose of realizing gains resulting from the appreciation of value of those properties  we  however  may consider selling properties in the event circumstances should arise which would make a sale advisable or attractive  or to retire principal indebtedness 
we do not anticipate seeking further health care related investment opportunities such as lease or mortgage financing during and will instead focus on monitoring and enhancing our current investments  with specific emphasis on our foreclosure properties 
we plan to continue our goal of maintaining a one to one ratio of debt to shareholder s equity and reinstating our previous investment grade rating 
if we were to make new investments  we would consider such factors  as i the geographic area and type of property  ii the location  construction quality  condition and design of the property  iii the current and anticipated cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs and lease or mortgage obligations and to provide a competitive market return on equity to our investors  iv the growth  tax and regulatory environments of the communities in which the properties are located  v occupancy and demand for similar health care facilities in the same or nearby communities  vi the quality  experience and creditworthiness of the management operating the facilities located on the property  and vii the mix of private and government sponsored patients 
there can be no assurances that investments containing these attributes will be found or closed 
we will not  without the approval of a majority of the board of directors  enter into any joint venture relationships with or acquire from or sell to any director  officer  or employee of nhc or nhi  or any affiliate thereof  as the case may be  any of our assets or other property 
the board of directors  without the approval of the stockholders  may alter our investment policies if they determine that such a change is in our best interests and our stockholders best interests 
the methods of implementing our investment policies may vary as new investment and financing techniques are developed or for other reasons 
we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to make investments in health care related facilities or business when it is advisable in the opinion of the board of directors 
we may negotiate other lines of credit  or arrange for other short or long term borrowings from banks  nhc or otherwise 
we have and may arrange for long term borrowings from institutional investors or through public offerings 
we have invested and may in the future invest in properties subject to existing loans or secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens with favorable terms or remic investments 
advisory agreement we entered into the advisory agreement on october  with nhc as advisor under which nhc provides management and advisory services to us during the term of the advisory agreement 
we believe the advisory agreement benefits us by providing access to nhc s extensive experience in the ownership and management of long term care facilities and retirement centers 
under the advisory agreement  we engaged nhc to use its best efforts a to present to us a continuing and suitable investment program consistent with our investment policies adopted by the board of directors from time to time  b to manage our day to day affairs and operations  and c to provide administrative services and facilities appropriate for such management 
in performing its obligations under the advisory agreement  nhc is subject to the supervision of and policies established by our board of directors 
the advisory agreement was initially for a stated term which expired december  the agreement is now on a year to year term  but terminable on days notice  and we may terminate the advisory agreement for cause at any time 
for its services under the advisory agreement  the advisor is entitled to annual compensation in a base amount of million  payable in monthly installments of  the full fee  although earned  will be prorated to the extent that funds from operations ffo is less than per share 
under the advisory agreement  we reimburse nhc for certain out of pocket expenses including those incurred in connection with borrowed money  taxes  fees to independent contractors  legal and accounting services and stockholder distributions and communications 
for and later years the annual compensation is calculated on a formula which is related to the increase in funds from operations per common share as defined in the advisory agreement 
in  the annual compensation expensed under the advisory agreement was approximately million 
the nhi board  in recognition of the fact that it chose to apply our ffo to debt payments during half of and three quarters of  rather than distribute dividends  amended the advisory agreement to delete the requirement that a per share dividend be paid 
the fee  however  is still dependent upon obtaining the stated ffo objective 
pursuant to the advisory agreement  nhc manages all of our day to day affairs and provides all such services through its personnel 
the advisory agreement provides that without regard to the amount of compensation received by nhc under the advisory agreement  nhc shall pay all expenses in performing its obligations including the employment expenses of the officers and directors and personnel of nhc providing services to us 
the advisory agreement further provides that we shall pay the expenses incurred with respect to and allocable to the prudent operation and business of nhi including any fees  salaries  and other employment costs  taxes and expenses paid to our directors  officers and employees who are not also employees of nhc

as of december   nhi had interests in real estate owned  and investments in mortgages  real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  preferred stock and marketable securities resulting in total invested assets of million 
nhi s mission is to invest in health care real estate which generates current income that will be distributed to stockholders 
nhi has pursued this mission by making mortgage loans and acquiring properties to lease nationwide primarily in the long term health care industry 
current conditions make it unlikely that any material new investments in health care properties will occur during instead  nhi is monitoring and improving its existing properties 
as of december   we were diversified with investments in health care facilities located in states consisting of long term care facilities  one acute care hospital  five medical office buildings  assisted living facilities  seven retirement centers and residential projects for the developmentally disabled 
these investments consisted of approximately million aggregate principal amount of loans to borrowers  million of purchase leaseback transactions with lessees and million invested in remic pass through certificates backed by first mortgage loans to ten operators 
of these facilities  were acquired through foreclosure and are owned and operated by us and are leased to national healthcare corporation nhc 
the owned and operated facilities are managed by subsidiaries of nhc 
nhc is our investment advisor 
consistent with our strategy of diversification  we have reduced the portion of our portfolio operated or managed by nhc from of total invested assets on october  to of total invested assets on december  at december   of the total invested assets of the health care facilities were operated by public operators  by regional operators  and by small operators 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition valuations and impairments to our investments since the long term health care industry has experienced material reductions in government and private insurance reimbursements 
while some legislative relief was granted in and  additional reductions in reimbursement have been imposed effective october  the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing for our lessees and mortgagees 
based on events occurring during each of the last three years and the current year  we determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying amount of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
we evaluate our marketable securities for other than temporary impairments consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accountant standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties  notes receivable  marketable securities and other investments are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  there are certain of our customers for which we have determined  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  that revenue for interest or rent is not realizable 
for these nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income when assured  which we consider to be the period the amounts are collected 
we identify investments as nonperforming if a required payment is not received within days of the date it is due 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to our stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
revenue recognition third party payors approximately two thirds of our facility operating revenues are derived from medicare  medicaid  and other government programs 
amounts earned under these programs are subject to review by the third party payors 
in our opinion  adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from these reviews 
any differences between our estimates of settlements and final determinations are reflected in operations in the year finalized 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of funds we have generated net cash from operating activities during totaling million compared to million in the prior year 
the primary reason for this year s change was due to an increase in net income offset partially by a reduction in the provision for loan  realty  and security losses and by a net gain on sale of real estate 
net cash from operating activities generally includes net income plus non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization and provision for investment losses  and working capital changes

net cash used in financing activities during totaled million compared to million in the prior year 
cash flows used in financing activities for included payments of convertible debentures of million  principal payments on debt of million and dividends paid to stockholders of million 
this compares to prior year activity of payments of credit facilities of million  principal payments on debt of million  payments of convertible debentures of million and dividends paid to stockholders of million 
cash flows provided by financing activities during included proceeds of 
million from debt compared to million in the prior period 
the lack of availability of reasonably priced capital limits our ability to make new investments 
due to the unstable environment in which we operate  we will continue to conservatively review our investment opportunities 
future sale of assets at depressed prices  refinancings of debt at higher interest rates or our inability to repay or extend debt when due would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

by december  only  of these senior subordinated debentures remained outstanding  the balance having converted into common stock

funds from operations we have adopted the definition of funds from operations ffo prescribed by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo is defined as net income loss applicable to common stockholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation of real property and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities in which a reit holds an interest 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operations  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is helpful in evaluating a real estate investment portfolio s overall performance considering the fact that historical cost accounting implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
the following table reconciles net income loss applicable to common stockholders to funds from to operations applicable to common stockholders year ended december  net income loss applicable to common stockholders   adjustments real estate depreciation    other items discontinued operations operating income discontinued  gain on sale of real estate  basic funds from operations applicable to common stockholders  interest on convertible subordinated debentures  diluted funds from operations applicable to common stockholders    basic funds from operations per share

shares for basic funds from operations per share   shares for diluted funds from operations per share   impact of inflation inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting our cost of financing its operations 
our revenues are generated primarily from long term investments and the operation of long term care facilities 
inflation has remained relatively low during recent periods 
in addition  historical reimbursement rates under the medicare and medicaid programs generally have reflected the underlying increases in health care costs and expenses resulting from inflation 
however  there can be no assurance that future medicare or medicaid rate increases will be sufficient to offset future inflation increases 
certain of our leases require increases in rental income based upon increases in the revenues of the tenants

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months when purchased 
all of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
our investment in preferred stock represents an investment in the preferred stock of another real estate investment trust and bears interest at a fixed rate of 
the underlying mortgages included in our investments in real estate mortgage investment conduits remics also bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investment in notes receivable  preferred stock and remics are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december    of our debt bears interest at fixed interest rates 
as of december    of our convertible subordinated debentures bear interest at fixed rates 
because the majority of the interest rates of these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has an immaterial impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
the remaining  of our debt and  of our convertible subordinated debentures bear interest at variable rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates may have a material impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
the future use of such instruments will be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
equity price risk we consider our investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in stockholders equity in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
the investments in marketable securities are recorded at their fair market value based on quoted market prices 
thus  there is exposure to equity price risk  which is the potential change in fair value due to a change in quoted market prices 
hypothetically  a change in quoted market prices would result in a related change in the fair value of our investments in marketable securities 
in addition  a hypothetical change in the quoted market prices of our subordinated convertible debentures would result in a related change in the fair value of the debenture instruments
