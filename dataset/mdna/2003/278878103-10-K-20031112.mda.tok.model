critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united state of america 
the preparation of these statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes  impairment of long lived assets and contingencies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following accounting policies involve its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements

the company recorded an impairment loss on its shrimp farm operation in fiscal year an estimate of the fair value of its assets was made based on external appraisals of the land and buildings and internal estimates of the realizable value of the equipment 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change  the company may be required to record additional impairment losses for its shrimp farm operation or additional charges for disallowed costs on its government contracts
