future trends life science during fiscal  meridian opened its protein production laboratory for business  creating the opportunity to serve as an enabler in the development of new drugs and vaccines 
this protein production laboratory is an extension of meridian s existing antigen manufacturing technologies and capabilities 
it will create a new class of customers  pharmaceutical companies  as well as the opportunity to leverage sales and marketing resources 
sales and marketing resources at meridian s viral antigens and biodesign subsidiaries are being aligned to 
table of contents focus on common customers and complimentary products 
as part of our overall life science strategy  meridian also expects to develop or license unique biological tools and technology 
european diagnostics meridian s european diagnostics operating segment experienced sales growth in fy of  following two successive years of sales declines of in fiscal and in fiscal although currency translation accounts for most of the fiscal increase  sales in local currency  the euro  increased during fiscal  compared to fiscal during the last three years  competitive factors and government reimbursement policies slowed growth in european markets and sales in fiscal and fiscal were also negatively affected by currency translation 
in response to these market conditions  meridian restructured its european distribution operations in fiscal and by moving the export business from germany to belgium  and moving the german in country business to an independent distributor this latter move also affected sales because meridian no longer sells to end user customers on a direct basis in germany 
this restructuring has improved overall operating results for the european diagnostics operating segment by lowering its cost structure 
based on operating results for fiscal and expectations for fiscal  meridian believes that sales levels in local currency have stabilized  and in fact  believes that market conditions have begun to improve and will yield modest growth 
us diagnostics consolidation of the us healthcare industry is expected to continue and potentially affect meridian s customers 
industry consolidation puts pressure on pricing and aggregates buying power 
in response  in the last four years  meridian has entered into  extended or renewed several exclusive multiple year contracts with consolidated healthcare providers and supply agreements with major reference laboratories 
research and development meridian believes that internally developed products will continue to be a critical source of sales and sales growth 
research and development efforts are expected to focus on the development of new products and product improvements where meridian has a dominant market position  or its intellectual property is protected by patents or licenses 
meridian expects its the life science operating segment will serve as a key platform for sourcing biologicals and technologies  by acquisition or license  for development of new products for all of meridian s operating segments 
one of meridian s specific strategies in this area is to target biologicals that have commercial product applications across multiple markets  such as human diagnostics  veterinary diagnostics and therapeutics 
this 
table of contents strategy is expected to leverage research and development resources as products can be developed with all three markets in mind  rather than on a market by market basis 
operating segments as a result of changes that occurred in february in the organization and management of meridian s businesses  effective with the quarter beginning january  meridian s second quarter  meridian changed its reportable operating segments to us diagnostics formerly referred to as meridian bioscience  inc or mbi  european diagnostics formerly referred to as meridian bioscience europe or mbe and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics operating segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in europe  africa and the middle east 
the life science operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee and saco  maine  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad

for the us diagnostics operating segment  the sales increase was primarily related to volume growth in new and existing products 
for new products  meridian began distributing new diagnostic tests for the detection of flu and rsv during the first quarter of fiscal these new products contributed sales of approximately million and are a result of meridian s recent distribution agreement with binax  inc other new products included immunocard stat hpsa  a rapid test for the detection of h 
pylori 
this product was introduced into non us markets in late fiscal non us markets for fiscal contributed a full year of sales of approximately  meridian expects to introduce this product into the us market beginning in fiscal  upon clearance from the fda 
for existing products  volume growth was strong in c

a substantial portion of growth in mycoplasma and h 
pylori products occurred in export markets  including japan 
certain of the sales of mycoplasma product into japan related to the sars outbreak 
this product was used to exclude the diagnosis of certain respiratory ailments having similar symptoms  such as mycoplasma  during the diagnosis of patients potentially infected with sars 
meridian also began selling premier platinum hpsa into japan during the fourth quarter of fiscal  upon the japanese government establishing the amount of insurance reimbursement 
for the european diagnostics operating segment  the sales increase includes currency translation gains in the amount of approximately million 
sales in local currency  the euro  increased 
for the life science operating segment  the decrease in sales for fiscal was primarily due to orders for make to order bulk antigen products with one customer 
this customer provided sales of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
for such products  bulk quantities are manufactured pursuant to customer purchase orders 
sales are recorded upon shipment 
this customer is currently experiencing delays in taking delivery of certain bulk antigen from meridian 
these delays are not related to the quality of meridian s product 
as a result of these delays  the life science operating 
table of contents segment may generate an operating loss for the first quarter of fiscal that would be recouped during the second quarter  upon commencement of shipments to this customer 
although  there can be no assurances that shipments will commence during the second quarter

meridian s premier toxins a b and premier platinum hpsa led the volume growth for these two disease states 
both of these products were developed by meridian and launched in and  respectively 
for the european diagnostics operating segment  the decline in sales during fiscal is net of currency translation gains of  it reflects volume declines attributable to continued deterioration in market conditions in germany  as well as price erosion and volume declines related to competition for certain products in italy and other european markets

table of contents liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis meridian s operating cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets and consideration of acquisition plans 
meridian has historically maintained line of credit availability to respond to acquisition opportunities quickly 
net cash provided by operating activities increased  or  to  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to earning levels and changes in deferred taxes  and also reflects higher investments in receivables and inventories 
net cash used for investing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal  and primarily related to capital expenditures and viral antigens earnout payments during both periods 
the higher level of capital expenditures during fiscal reflects the construction of viral antigens protein production laboratory 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal also included proceeds of  related to the sale of common stock received in the demutualization of two insurance companies during the first quarter 
net cash used for financing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal repayments of debt obligations  including the revolving credit facility  were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  reflecting meridian s intended efforts to pay down debt 
activity on the revolving credit facility during fiscal includes approximately  related to repayment of the mortgage loan for the viral antigens facilities that matured in january net cash flows from operating activities are anticipated to fund working capital requirements  debt service and dividends during fiscal capital resources the following table presents meridian s payments due on financing obligations as of september  amounts in thousands total bank term debt other debt obligations subordinated debentures 
table of contents meridian has a  credit facility with a commercial bank that includes  of term debt and capital lease capacity and a  line of credit that expires in september as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding on the line of credit portion of this facility  and the availability was  during november  meridian commenced an offer to exchange  of its convertible subordinated debentures for an equal principal amount of new convertible subordinated debentures that mature september  and bear interest at 
the exchange offer expires december  the new debentures will be convertible into meridian s common stock at a price of per share 
subsequent to a successful exchange of  of its convertible subordinated debentures  meridian expects to redeem the remaining  at par through the revolving credit facility 
these measures are expected to reduce annual interest expense by approximately  upon completion of the exchange offer and redemptions  the remaining carrying value of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the convertible subordinated debentures   at september   will be charged to expense 
all of the bank term debt is denominated in the euro currency and bears interest at a variable rate tied to euro libor 
a one percentage point increase in the euro libor rate would increase fiscal interest expense by approximately  for this debt 
this debt serves as a natural currency hedge against certain euro denominated intercompany receivables 
the viral antigens acquisition  completed in fiscal  provides for additional purchase consideration up to a maximum remaining amount of  contingent upon viral antigens future earnings through september  earnout consideration is payable each year  following the period earned 
earnout payments  if any  may require financing under the line of credit or other bank credit facility 
earnout consideration in the amount of  related to fiscal is due to be paid in the second quarter of fiscal and will be financed on meridian s line of credit 
meridian s capital expenditures are estimated to be  for fiscal  and may be funded with operating cash flows or availability under the  credit facility discussed above

royalties meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to as much as  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics operating segment 
for one of these license agreements  meridian is engaged in a dispute with the licensor regarding the payment of royalties 
the licensor has claimed additional royalties due from meridian in the amount of approximately  meridian believes that it has satisfactorily complied with all provisions of this license agreement  and therefore  disputes this claim 
in addition  meridian believes that it has valid claims against the licensor under this agreement 
this matter is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations or financial condition 
unconditional purchase commitments meridian has entered into agreements to distribute diagnostic test kits that are manufactured by other diagnostic manufacturing companies 
one of these agreements requires meridian to purchase minimum quantities of diagnostic kits during month measurement periods 
aggregate minimum purchase commitments under this agreement amount to approximately  for fiscal for this agreement  meridian did not meet the minimum purchase provisions contained therein for fiscal due to the actual size of the market for this specific product being smaller than anticipated prior to execution of the agreement 
meridian and the other party to this agreement have subsequently adjusted the minimum purchase provisions to align with current market expectations 
the amendment to this agreement did not result in any further financial obligation for meridian 
contract research and development during fiscal  meridian executed a research and development agreement and an exclusive supply agreement with orasure technologies  inc to commercialize the uplink technology 
these agreements  assuming certain milestones were met  would require meridian to make future payments to orasure to fund research and development activities for specific diagnostic products and to obtain an exclusive license to market and sell such products on a global basis 
these agreements were terminated in november costs to terminate these agreements were not material

meridian has debt obligations in the aggregate amount of  outstanding at september   of which  bears interest at variable rates 
information concerning the maturities of interest rate sensitive debt is included in the discussion of capital resources above 
to date  meridian has not employed a hedging strategy with respect to interest rate risk 
meridian is exposed to foreign currency risk related to its european distribution operations  including foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables  as well as euro denominated term debt 
the euro denominated term debt serves as a natural hedge against a portion of the euro denominated intercompany receivables 
fda matters during january  the fda completed an inspection of meridian s compliance with the quality systems regulations that govern the manufacturing of in vitro diagnostics 
in response to this inspection  in january  meridian submitted a comprehensive plan to the fda outlining specific steps it committed to undertake to improve its quality systems 
in june  meridian received a warning letter from the fda which summarized and reiterated certain of the observations made by the fda during their inspection completed in january in august  the fda completed an on site follow up inspection to its january inspection 
the fda issued several observations  primarily aimed at fine tuning established quality control systems and procedures 
meridian submitted written corrective action plans to address these refinements and continues its periodic communications with the fda on the progress of its comprehensive plan submitted to the fda in january in accordance with the fda s directive in the warning letter  meridian is required to undergo three annual independent audits to evaluate meridian s progress implementing its comprehensive plan 
the first audit was 
table of contents completed in november the second audit was completed in may the reports from these audits substantiated meridian s continued progress in addressing issues raised in the prior fda and independent audits 
meridian responded to the latest observations and recommendations with corrective actions designed to further improve its established quality control systems and procedures 
at present  it is uncertain whether meridian s actions will be sufficient so that no further remedial action or enforcement action by the fda will occur 
during fiscal  meridian incurred costs and asset impairment charges in the amount of  related to implementation of its comprehensive plan submitted to the fda and the discontinuance of manufacturing and distributing approximately products 
of this amount   related to implementation costs of the comprehensive plan  primarily consulting fees 
the remaining  related to asset impairment charges and product recall costs 
impaired assets included inventory and certain intangibles 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition meridian s revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates and cash discounts that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling meridian s products 
management estimates reserves for rebate agreements and cash discounts based on historical statistics  current trends and other factors 
changes to these reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
revenue for the life science operating segment s protein production laboratory is recognized either upon shipment of product or final lot acceptance depending on contract terms 
during fiscal  meridian adopted eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including the reseller of a vendor s products 
eitf no 
affected the manner in which meridian estimates reserves for distributor rebate agreements 
rebate agreements are in place with certain 
table of contents independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling meridian s products 
reserves for rebate agreements include components for reported but unpaid rebates to date and rebates not yet reported 
meridian s reserves for rebate agreements were increased by approximately  upon adoption of eitf no 
inventories meridian s inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis  except for inventories in the viral antigens business for which cost is determined on a last in  first out basis 
meridian establishes reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
management estimates reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory writedowns would be required and this would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
changes to inventory reserves are recorded in the period that they become known 
for the viral antigens purchase business combination  meridian elected to use last in  first out accounting for inventories for financial reporting purposes 
under last in  first out accounting  the stepped up inventory value will be charged to earnings in periods in which inventory quantities decline below those on hand at the acquisition date 
to date  inventory quantities have remained above levels on hand at the acquisition date 
intangible assets meridian s intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  trade names and non compete agreements 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
during the first quarter of fiscal  meridian adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized over their useful lives  but rather  are now subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from the analyses required by sfas no 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers an impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its carrying 
table of contents value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
meridian adopted sfas no 
effective october  there were no impairments from adoption 
meridian s ability to recover its intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
the application of sfas nos 
and requires management to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  this could trigger impairment of intangible assets 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  meridian s provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income for tax purposes 
meridian s deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax asset considered realizable could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in meridian s foreign subsidiaries are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiaries 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
management believes that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid in applicable foreign jurisdictions
