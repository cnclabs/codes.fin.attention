fiscal rental revenue increased  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal although the total leasable space decreased  the area under roof actually increased 
the rental revenue per square foot for the area under roof is significantly higher than the outside area and as a result more than offset for the loss of the revenue from the outside area 
in addition  the revenue also increased as a result of the normal cpi rate increases 
nonetheless  rental revenue does not cover all operating costs and interest expense  yielding deficits of  and  in fiscal years and respectively 
while the company and its retained broker are actively marketing the properties to prospective tenants  there can be no assurance that tenants will be found in the near term or at rates comparable with existing leases
