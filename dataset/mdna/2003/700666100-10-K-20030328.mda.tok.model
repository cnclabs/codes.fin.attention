management has made their best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
the company does not believe that there is great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company does not have off balance sheet arrangements  financings or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons  also known as special purpose entities 
the company currently uses no derivative instruments 
revenue recognition the company recognizes more than of its revenue when title is transferred to unaffiliated customers  typically upon shipment 
the company s remaining revenue  from long term contracts  is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting

the company s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable have been reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
allowances are developed by the individual operating units based on historical losses  adjusting for economic conditions 
the company s policy is to identify and reserve for specific collectibility concerns based on customers financial condition and payment history 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
writeoffs of accounts receivable have historically been low 
allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand with minimal sales activity over the past twelve months  which is compared to estimated future usage and sales 
inventories identified by management as slow moving or obsolete are reserved for based on estimated selling prices less disposal costs 
though the company considers these allowances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on reserve allowances required 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed by management for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during and  the company decided to exit certain under performing product lines and to close or consolidate certain operating facilities and  accordingly  recorded restructuring and impairment charges as discussed above and in note n to the consolidated financial statements

deferred income tax assets and liabilities the company accounts for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently enacted tax rates 
in determining these amounts  management determined the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income and the extended period of time over which the postretirement benefits will be paid 
at december   the company has net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million  which will expire in or in accordance with the provisions of fas accounting for income taxes  the tax benefits related to these carryforwards have been fully reserved as of december  since the company is in a three year cumulative loss position

stock based compensation the company has elected to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  because the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equals the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
compensation expense resulting from fixed awards of restricted shares is measured at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period 
an alternative method of accounting for stock based compensation would be the fair value method defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
fas permits use of the intrinsic value method and does not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
had compensation cost for stock options granted been determined based on the fair value method of fas  the company s net loss and diluted loss per share would have been increased by 
million 
per share in and 
million 
per share in the company s net income would have been reduced by million and diluted earnings by

the company is participating in the cost of certain clean up efforts at several of these sites 
however  the company s share of such costs has not been material and based on available information  management of the company does not expect the company s exposure at any of these locations to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company has been named as one of many defendants in asbestos related personal injury lawsuits 
the company s cost of defending such lawsuits has not been material to date and based upon available information  management of the company does not expect the company s future costs for asbestos related lawsuits to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
the company cautions however that inherent in management s estimates of the company s exposure are expected trends in claims severity  frequency and other factors which may materially vary as claims are filed and settled or otherwise resolved 
seasonality  variability of operating results the company s results of operations are typically stronger in the first six months rather than the last six months of each calendar year due to scheduled plant maintenance in the third quarter to coincide with customer plant shutdowns and to holidays in the fourth quarter 
the timing of orders placed by the company s customers has varied with  among other factors  orders for customers finished goods  customer production schedules  competitive conditions and general economic conditions 
the variability of the level and timing of orders has  from time to time  resulted in significant periodic and quarterly fluctuations in the operations of the company s business units 
such variability is particularly evident at the capital equipment businesses  included in the manufactured products segment  which typically ship a few large systems per year
