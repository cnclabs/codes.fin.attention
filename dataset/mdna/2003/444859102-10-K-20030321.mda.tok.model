item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a description of a number of factors that could adversely affect our results 
business segments we manage our business with two segments commercial and government 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals  and includes three lines of business fully insured medical  administrative services only  or aso  and specialty 
the government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs  and includes three lines of business medicare choice  medicaid  and tricare 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business 
the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing  benefits  and underwriting requirements 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other income  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks  enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 

table of contents strategy our business strategy centers on increasing commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the government segment 
our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer centric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry leading electronic capabilities  including education  tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet 
the intent of our commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction  loyalty and brand awareness 
we are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our commercial strategy 
our products the following table presents our segment membership  premiums and aso fees by product for the year ended december  medical membership specialty membership premiums aso fees total premiums and aso fees percent of total premiums and aso fees commercial fully insured hmo ppo total fully insured administrative services only specialty total commercial government medicare choice medicaid tricare tricare aso total government total our products marketed to commercial segment members new generation of products we have developed a range of innovative products that we believe will be a solution for employers who are consistently facing double digit premium increases as medical costs also continue to rise at that same level 
our new generation of products encompass more choices for the individual consumer  transparency of provider costs  guidance when consumers need it most  and benefit designs that engage consumers in the financial implications of the choices they make with respect to their health care 
innovative tools and technology are available to assist consumers with these decisions  including trade offs between higher premiums and point of service costs at the time consumers choose their plans  and ways in which the consumers can maximize their individual benefits at the point they use their plans 
these products are sold to employers with humana as the sole carrier  but are available as either a fully insured or self funded option to employers 

table of contents hmo our health maintenance organization  or hmo  products provide prepaid health insurance coverage to our members through a network of independent primary care physicians  specialty physicians and other health care providers who contract with the hmo to furnish such services 
primary care physicians generally include internists  family practitioners and pediatricians 
generally  the member s primary care physician must approve access to certain specialty physicians and other health care providers 
these other health care providers include  among others  hospitals  nursing homes  home health agencies  pharmacies  mental health and substance abuse centers  diagnostic centers  optometrists  outpatient surgery centers  dentists  urgent care centers and durable medical equipment suppliers 
because the primary care physician must generally approve access to many of these other health care providers  the hmo product is the most restrictive form of managed care 
an hmo member  typically through the member s employer  pays a monthly fee  which generally covers  with some copayments  health care services received from or approved by the member s primary care physician 
for the year ended december   commercial hmo premium revenues totaled approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
ppo our preferred provider organization  or ppo  products include some elements of managed health care  however  they typically include more cost sharing with the member  through copayments and annual deductibles 
ppos are also similar to traditional health insurance because they provide a member with more freedom to choose a physician or other health care provider 
in a ppo  the member is encouraged  through financial incentives  to use participating health care providers  which have contracted with the ppo to provide services at favorable rates 
in the event a member chooses not to use a participating health care provider  the member may be required to pay a greater portion of the provider s fees 
for the year ended december   commercial ppo premium revenues totaled approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
individual products in june  we introduced humanaone  our first product marketed directly to individuals 
we have introduced this product in select markets where we can utilize our existing networks and distribution channels 
administrative services only we offer an administrative services only  or aso  product to those who self insure their employee health plans 
we receive fees to provide administrative services which generally include the processing of claims  offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs  and responding to customer services inquiries from members of self funded employers 
these products may include all of the same benefit and product design characteristics of our fully insured ppo and hmo products described above  however  under aso contracts  self funded employers retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits 
for the year ended december   commercial administrative services fees totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
specialty products we also offer various specialty products including dental  group life and short term disability 
at december   we had approximately million specialty members 
for the year ended december   specialty product premium revenues were approximately million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 

table of contents our products marketed to government segment members medicare choice product medicare is a federal program that provides persons age and over and some disabled persons certain hospital and medical insurance benefits  which include hospitalization benefits for up to days per incident of illness plus a lifetime reserve aggregating days 
each medicare eligible individual is entitled to receive inpatient hospital care  known as part a care  without the payment of any premium  but is required to pay a premium to the federal government  which is adjusted annually  to be eligible for physician care and other services  known as part b care 
we contract with cms under the medicare choice program to provide health insurance coverage in exchange for a fixed monthly payment per member for medicare eligible individuals residing in the geographic areas in which our hmos operate 
individuals who elect to participate in medicare choice programs receive additional benefits not covered by medicare and are relieved of the obligation to pay some or all of the deductible or coinsurance amounts but are generally required to use exclusively the services provided by the hmo subject to nominal copayments and coinsurance and are required to pay a part b premium to the medicare program 
the medicare choice product involves a contract between an hmo and cms  pursuant to which cms makes a fixed monthly payment to the hmo on behalf of each medicare eligible individual that chooses to enroll for coverage in the hmo 
the fixed monthly payment  payable on the first day of a month  is determined by formula established by federal law 
we sometimes receive the fixed monthly payment early due to a weekend or holiday falling on the first day of a month 
this receipt is significant  the timing of which can cause material fluctuation in operating cash flows 
we also collect additional member premiums from our members in certain of our markets 
at december   we provided health insurance coverage under cms contracts to approximately  medicare choice members for which we received premium revenues of approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees for one such cms contract covered approximately  members in florida and accounted for premium revenues of approximately billion  which represented of our medicare choice premium revenues  or of our total premiums and aso fees for our medicare choice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one year term each december unless terminated days prior thereto 
our average rate of statutory increase under the medicare choice contracts is approximately 
over the last five years  annual increases have ranged from as low as the january increase of to as high as in january  with an average of approximately 
on january   we ceased providing our medicare choice product in counties in kentucky and county in illinois  affecting approximately  members 
on january   we exited certain counties in several of our markets  affecting about  members 
these exits were the result  in part  of lower cms reimbursement rates 
we are working with cms to develop other alternative offerings 
for example  we are participating in a medicare choice pilot program offering a private fee for service product in dupage county  illinois and a ppo product in pinellas county  florida 
tricare tricare provides health insurance coverage to the dependents of active duty military personnel and to retired military personnel and their dependents 
in november  the united states department of defense awarded us our first tricare contract for regions and covering approximately million eligible beneficiaries in florida  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  alabama  tennessee and eastern louisiana 
on july   we began providing health insurance coverage to these approximately million eligible beneficiaries 

table of contents on may   we acquired for million the outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed anthem alliance health insurance company subsidiary responsible for administering tricare benefits for regions and to approximately million eligible members in illinois  indiana  kentucky  michigan  a portion of missouri  north carolina  ohio  tennessee  virginia  wisconsin and west virginia 
we currently are in negotiations with the department of defense to extend our tricare contracts that expire on april  for regions and and june  for regions and we believe we will be able to successfully extend our tricare contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new tricare next generation  or t nex  transition described below 
historical pretax profit margins for our tricare business have generally ranged from to percent 
we expect margins to continue in this range during the department of defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new t nex program 
the department of defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract  although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract 
we submitted a bid in january to participate as a prime contractor for the south region 
additionally  we partnered with aetna government health plans  llc  a subsidiary of aetna  inc to participate as a subcontractor should aetna government health plans  llc be awarded the north region 
an announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late at this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract  or the effective date of the contract 
if we are a successful bidder on the south region  we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  although tricare profits could decline slightly 
tricare membership would not materially change from current levels 
tricare revenues and expenses would decline by approximately as a result of certain benefits  eg pharmacy  which are included under our current contract  being excluded and under separate t nex contracts in the future 
currently  three health benefit options are available to tricare beneficiaries 
in addition to a traditional indemnity option  participants may enroll in an hmo like plan with a point of service option or take advantage of reduced copayments by using a network of preferred providers 
we have subcontracted with third parties to provide various administration and specialty services under the contracts 
for the year ended december   tricare premium revenues were approximately billion  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
at december   we had  tricare aso members for which the department of defense retains the risk of financing the cost of their health benefits 
we obtained these members from our acquisition of regions and  and from two government programs that allow senior members to continue in the tricare program even after becoming medicare eligible  which is normally age the first of these programs  called tricare senior pharmacy  became effective april  under this government administrative services program  senior tricare members receive certain pharmacy benefits not covered under medicare 
on october   the tricare for life program became effective  and expanded coverage to include medical benefits as well 
we are engaged by the department of defense to provide these administrative services through change orders to our existing tricare contracts 
once t nex becomes effective  our participation in these aso programs will allow us to competitively bid for certain of the services under separate contracts 
although we will not bid on the tricare for life contract under t nex  we may bid on other services under separate t nex contracts 
anticipated changes to these benefits contracted separately contribute to the expected decline in total tricare revenue discussed above 
for the year ended december   tricare administrative services fees totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
medicaid product medicaid is a federal program that is state operated to facilitate the delivery of health care services to low income residents 
each state that chooses to do so develops  through a state specific regulatory agency  a 
table of contents medicaid managed care initiative that must be approved by cms 
cms requires that medicaid managed care plans meet federal standards and cost no more than the amount that would have been spent on a comparable fee for service basis 
states currently either use a formal proposal process in which they review many bidders before selecting one or award individual contracts to qualified bidders which apply for entry to the program 
in either case  the contractual relationship with a state is generally for a one year period 
under these contracts  we receive a fixed monthly payment from a government agency for which we are required to provide health insurance coverage to enrolled members 
due to the increased emphasis on state health care reform and budgetary constraints  more states are utilizing a managed care product in their medicaid programs 
effective july   we signed two contracts in puerto rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in puerto rico s medicaid program 
the term of each of these contracts is three years  subject to annual renewal options with the health insurance administration in puerto rico 
our medicaid contracts in florida and illinois generally are annual contracts 
for the year ended december   premium revenues from our medicaid products totaled million  or of our total premiums and aso fees 
at december   we had approximately  medicaid members in puerto rico  or of total medicaid members  and  medicaid members in florida and illinois  or of total medicaid members 
the following table summarizes our medical membership at december   by market and product commercial government percent of total hmo ppo aso medicare choice medicaid tricare total in thousands florida illinois texas puerto rico ohio kentucky wisconsin georgia virginia north carolina arizona south carolina tennessee indiana alabama michigan missouri kansas mississippi colorado tricare aso others totals provider arrangements we provide our members with access to health care services through our networks of health care providers with whom we have contracted  including hospitals and other independent facilities such as outpatient surgery centers  primary care physicians  specialist physicians  dentists and providers of ancillary health care services and facilities 
we have approximately  contracts with health care providers participating in our networks  
table of contents which consist of approximately  physicians   hospitals  and  ancillary providers and dentists 
these ancillary services and facilities include ambulance services  medical equipment services  home health agencies  mental health providers  rehabilitation facilities  nursing homes  optical services and pharmacies 
our membership base and the ability to influence where our members seek care generally enable us to obtain contractual discounts with providers 
we use a variety of techniques to provide access to effective and efficient use of health care services for our members 
these techniques include the coordination of care for our members  product and benefit designs  hospital inpatient management systems  or hims  and enrolling members into various disease management programs 
the focal point for health care services in many of our medicare choice and hmo networks is the primary care physician who  under contract  provides services  and may control utilization of appropriate services  by directing or approving hospitalization and referrals to specialists and other providers 
some physicians may have arrangements under which they can earn bonuses when certain target goals relating to the provisions of patient care are met 
our hims programs use specially trained physicians to effectively manage the entire range of an hmo members medical care during a hospital admission and to effectively coordinate the members discharge and post discharge care 
we have available a variety of disease management programs related to specific medical conditions such as congestive heart failure  coronary artery disease  prenatal and premature infant care  asthma related illness  end stage renal disease  diabetes and breast cancer screening 
we also may focus on certain rare conditions where disease management techniques benefit members in a more cost effective manner 
we typically contract with hospitals on either a per diem rate  which is an all inclusive rate per day  a case rate  which is an all inclusive rate per admission  or at a discounted charge for inpatient hospital services 
outpatient hospital services are generally contracted at a flat rate by type of service or at a discounted charge 
these contracts are often multi year agreements with rates that are adjusted for inflation annually based on the consumer price index or other nationally recognized inflation index 
outpatient surgery centers and other ancillary providers are typically contracted at flat rates per service provided or are reimbursed based upon a nationally recognized fee schedule such as the medicare allowable fee schedule 
our contracts with physicians typically are automatically renewed each year  unless either party gives written notice to the other party of their intent to terminate the arrangement 
most of the physicians in our ppo networks and some of our physicians in our hmo networks are reimbursed based upon a fixed fee schedule  which typically provides for reimbursement based upon a percentage of the standard medicare allowable fee schedule 
capitation for of our december  medical membership  we contract with hospitals and physicians to accept financial risk for a defined set of hmo membership 
in transferring this risk  we prepay these providers a monthly fixed fee per member  known as a capitation payment  to coordinate substantially all of the medical care for their capitated hmo membership  including some health benefit administrative functions and claims processing 
for these capitated hmo arrangements  we generally agree to reimbursement rates that target a medical expense ratio ranging from to 
providers participating in hospital based capitated hmo arrangements generally receive a monthly payment for all of the services within their system for their hmo membership 
providers participating in physician based capitated hmo arrangements generally have subcontracted directly with hospitals and specialist physicians  and are responsible for reimbursing such hospitals and physicians for services rendered to their hmo membership 
for of our december  medical membership  we contract with physicians under risk sharing arrangements whereby physicians have assumed some level of risk for all or a portion of the medical costs of their hmo membership 
although these arrangements do include capitation payments for services rendered  we process substantially all of the claims under these arrangements 

table of contents physicians under these types of arrangements typically have stop loss coverage so that a physician s financial risk for any single member is limited to a maximum amount on an annual basis 
we remain financially responsible for health care services to our members in the event our providers fail to provide such services

table of contents accreditation assessment our accreditation assessment program consists of several internal programs such as those that credential providers and those designed to meet the audit standards of federal and state agencies and external accreditation standards 
we also offer quality and outcome measurement and improvement programs such as the health plan employer data information sets  or hedis  which is used by employers  government purchasers and the national committee for quality assurance  or ncqa  to evaluate hmos based on various criteria  including effectiveness of care and member satisfaction 
physicians participating in our hmo networks must satisfy specific criteria  including licensing  patient access  office standards  after hours coverage and other factors 
most participating hospitals also meet accreditation criteria established by cms and or the joint commission on accreditation of healthcare organizations  or jcaho 
recredentialing of participating providers occurs every two to three years  depending on applicable state laws 
recredentialing of participating physicians includes verification of their medical license  review of their malpractice liability claims history  review of their board certification  if applicable  and review of any complaints  including any member appeals and grievances 
committees  composed of a peer group of physicians  review the applications of physicians being considered for credentialing and recredentialing 
we request accreditation for certain of our hmo plans from ncqa and the american accreditation healthcare commission utilization review accreditation commission  or aahc urac 
accreditation or external review by an approved organization is mandatory in the states of florida and kansas for licensure as an hmo 
accreditation specific to the utilization review process is also required in the state of georgia for licensure as an hmo or ppo 
certain commercial businesses  like those impacted by united auto workers contracts and those where the request comes from the employer  require or prefer accredited health plans 
ncqa performs reviews of standards for quality improvement  credentialing  utilization management  preventative health  and member rights and responsibilities 
we continue to maintain accreditation in select markets through ncqa 
three markets maintain ncqa accredited status for all hmo product lines humana health plan of ohio  inc in cincinnati  ohio excellent  humana medical plan  inc in north florida commendable  and central florida commendable 
aahc urac performs reviews of standards for utilization management  and for health plan standards in quality management  credentialing  rights and responsibilities  and network management 
seven markets have achieved urac health plan accreditation for all hmo product lines humana medical plan  inc in north florida  south florida  central florida daytona  tampa and orlando  humana health plan of ohio  inc in cincinnati  ohio  and humana health plan  inc in kentucky and in kansas 
the atlanta market has urac utilization management accreditation for hmo and ppo product lines 
aahc urac utilization management accreditation was received for humana military healthcare services  inc  which administers the tricare program and for the green bay service center 
some of our hmo entities are unaccredited  because we sought accreditation only where regulatory requirements were in place  such as in florida  which requires accreditation for hmo licensing  or in market areas where commercial groups use it as a variable in choosing carriers 
as the requirements of accreditation have become less focused on factors under our control and more focused on other factors such as provider behavior  we have concluded that these programs do not add value for our customers 
we are piloting iso certification as an alternative to accreditation 
iso is the international standards organization  which has developed an international commercial set of certifications as to quality and process  called iso at this time  two clinical programs within the innovation center of humana have received iso registration transplant management and centralized clinical operations providing personal nurse services 

table of contents sales and marketing individuals become members of our commercial hmos and ppos through their employers or other groups which typically offer employees or members a selection of health insurance products  pay for all or part of the premiums and make payroll deductions for any premiums payable by the employees 
we attempt to become an employer s or group s exclusive source of health insurance benefits by offering a variety of hmo  ppo and specialty products that provide cost effective quality health care coverage consistent with the needs and expectations of the employees or members 
we use various methods to market our commercial  medicare choice and medicaid products  including television  radio  the internet  telemarketing and mailings 
at december   we used approximately  licensed independent brokers and agents and approximately licensed employees to sell our commercial products 
many of our employer group customers are represented by insurance brokers and consultants who assist these groups in the design and purchase of health care products 
we generally pay brokers a commission based on premiums  with commissions varying by market and premium volume 
at december   we employed approximately sales representatives  who are each paid a salary and or per member commission  to market our medicare choice and medicaid products in the continental us we also employed approximately telemarketing representatives who assisted in the marketing of medicare choice and medicaid products by making appointments for sales representatives with prospective members 
risk management through the use of internally developed underwriting criteria  we determine the risk we are willing to assume and the amount of premium to charge for our commercial products 
in most instances  employer and other groups must meet our underwriting standards in order to qualify to contract with us for coverage 
small group reform laws in some states have imposed regulations which provide for guaranteed issue of certain health insurance products and prescribe certain limitations on the variation in rates charged based upon assessment of health conditions 
underwriting techniques are not employed in connection with medicare choice products because cms regulations require us to accept all eligible medicare applicants regardless of their health or prior medical history 
we also are not permitted to employ underwriting criteria for the medicaid product  but rather we follow cms and state requirements 
in addition  with respect to our tricare business  we do not employ any underwriting techniques because we must accept all eligible beneficiaries who choose to participate 
competition the health benefits industry is highly competitive and contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid or renewed annually 
our competitors vary by local market and include other publicly traded managed care companies  national insurance companies and other hmos and ppos  including hmos and ppos owned by blue cross blue shield plans 
many of our competitors have larger memberships and or greater financial resources than our health plans in the markets in which we compete 
our ability to sell our products and to retain customers is  or may be  influenced by such factors as benefits  pricing  contract terms  number and quality of participating physicians and other managed health care providers  utilization review  claims processing  administrative efficiency  relationships with agents  quality of customer service and accreditation results 
government regulation government regulation of health care products and services is a changing area of law that varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to issue regulations and interpret 
table of contents and enforce laws and rules 
changes in applicable laws and regulations are continually being considered  and the interpretation of existing laws and rules also may change periodically 
these regulatory revisions could affect our operations and financial results 
also  it may become increasingly difficult to control medical costs if federal and state bodies continue to consider and enact significant and sometimes onerous managed care laws and regulations 
enforcement of health care fraud and abuse laws has become a top priority for the nation s law enforcement entities 
the funding of such law enforcement efforts has increased dramatically in the past few years and is expected to continue 
the focus of these efforts has been directed at participants in federal government health care programs such as medicare choice  medicaid and the federal employee health benefits program  or fehbp 
we participate extensively in these programs and have continued our stringent regulatory compliance efforts for these programs 
the programs are subject to very technical rules 
when combined with law enforcement intolerance for any level of noncompliance  these rules mean that compliance efforts in this area continue to be challenging 
we are subject to various governmental audits  investigations and enforcement actions 
these include possible government actions relating to the employee retirement income security act  as amended  or erisa  fehbp  federal and state fraud and abuse laws  and other laws relating to medicare choice  including adjusted community rating development  special payment status  and various other areas 
adjusted community rating development is the government defined rating formula used to justify the medicare choice benefits we offer individuals eligible for medicare benefits based on a particular community and certain other factors 
special payment status refers to  among others  medicare choice members who are institutionalized  medicaid eligible  or members who have contracted end stage renal disease 
the medicare choice plan receives a higher payment for members who qualify for one or more of these statuses 
we are currently involved in various government investigations  audits and reviews  some of which are under erisa  and the authority of state departments of insurance 
on may   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement with the office of the inspector general for the department of health and human services as part of a settlement of a medicare overpayment issue arising from an audit by the office of the inspector general 
although any of the pending government actions could result in assessment of damages  civil or criminal fines or penalties  or other sanctions against us  including exclusion from participation in government programs  we do not believe the results of any of these actions  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
of our seven licensed and active hmo subsidiaries as of march   five are qualified under the federal health maintenance organization act of  as amended 
to obtain federal qualification  an hmo must meet certain requirements  including conformance with benefit  rating and financial reporting standards 
in certain markets  and for certain products  we operate hmos that are not federally qualified because this provides greater flexibility with respect to product design and pricing than is possible for federally qualified hmos 
as of march   humana medical plan  inc  humana health plan of texas  inc  and humana health plan  inc 
each hold cms contracts under the medicare choice program to sell medicare hmo products in a total of six states 
in addition  humana insurance company holds a cms contract under a medicare choice pilot program to sell a private fee for service product in dupage county  illinois and a ppo product in pinellas county  florida 
cms conducts audits of hmos qualified under its medicare choice program at least biannually and may perform other reviews more frequently to determine compliance with federal regulations and contractual obligations 
these audits include review of the hmos administration and management  including management information and data collection systems  fiscal stability  utilization management and physician incentive arrangements  health services delivery  quality assurance  marketing  enrollment and disenrollment activity  claims processing  and complaint systems 

table of contents cms regulations require submission of quarterly and annual financial statements 
in addition  cms requires certain disclosures to cms and to medicare choice beneficiaries concerning operations of a health plan contracted under the medicare choice program 
cms s rules require disclosure to members upon request of information concerning financial arrangements and incentive plans between an hmo and physicians in the hmos networks 
these rules also require certain levels of stop loss coverage to protect contracted physicians against major losses relating to patient care  depending on the amount of financial risk they assume 
the reporting of certain health care data contained in hedis is another important cms disclosure requirement 
our medicaid products are regulated by the applicable state agency in the state in which we sell a medicaid product and by the health insurance administration in puerto rico  in conformance with federal approval of the applicable state plan  and are subject to periodic reviews by these agencies 
the reviews are similar in nature to those performed by cms 
laws in each of the states and the commonwealth of puerto rico in which we operate our hmos  ppos and other health insurance related services regulate our operations  including the scope of benefits  rate formulas  delivery systems  utilization review procedures  quality assurance  complaint systems  enrollment requirements  claim payments  marketing and advertising 
the hmo  ppo and other health insurance related products we offer are sold under licenses issued by the applicable insurance regulators 
under state laws  our hmos and health insurance companies are audited by state departments of insurance for financial and contractual compliance  and our hmos are audited for compliance with health services standards by respective state departments of health 
most states laws require such audits to be performed at least once every three years 
our licensed subsidiaries are subject to regulation under state insurance holding company and commonwealth of puerto rico regulations 
these regulations generally require  among other things  prior approval and or notice of new products  rates  benefit changes  and certain material transactions  including dividend payments  purchases or sales of assets  intercompany agreements and the filing of various financial and operational reports 
certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  require minimum levels of equity  and limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 
as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of  million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries 
each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated million 
although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume  product mix  and the quality of assets held  minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level 
certain states rely on risk based capital requirements  or rbc  to define the required levels of equity 
rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity s solvency 
this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels 
some states are in the process of phasing in these rbc requirements over a number of years 
if rbc were fully implemented by all states at december   each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance  and we would have million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under rbc 
one tricare subsidiary under the regions and contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities 
we were in compliance with this requirement at december  our management works proactively to ensure compliance with all governmental laws and regulations affecting our business 

table of contents health care reform there continue to be diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to address aspects of the nation s health care system 
federal in  congress passed the medicare  medicaid and state childrens health benefits improvement and protection act  or bipa  amending certain provisions of the balanced budget act of  and certain provisions of the medicare  medicaid and state children s health insurance program balanced budget refinement act of the balanced budget act changed the way health plans are compensated for medicare members by eliminating over five years amounts paid for graduate medical education  increasing the blend of national cost factors applied in determining local reimbursement rates over a six year phase in period and directing cms to implement a risk adjusted mechanism on its monthly member payment to medicare plans over the same period 
these changes have had the effect of reducing reimbursement in high cost metropolitan areas with a large number of teaching hospitals 
congress has subsequently lengthened this timetable to allow the risk adjusted mechanism to be fully implemented by bipa  among other things  enacted modest increases to the payment formula for medicare choice plans 
while we believe that these increases and modifications restore some medicare choice reimbursement  pending legislative and regulatory initiatives could cause us to again consider increasing enrollee out of pocket costs  modifying benefits or exiting markets 
on january   we exited our medicare product in counties in kentucky and county in illinois affecting approximately  members 
on january   we exited certain counties in several of our markets  affecting about  members 
these county exits were the result  in part  of lower cms reimbursement rates 
we are working with cms to develop other alternative offerings 
for example  we are participating in a medicare choice pilot program offering a private fee for service product in dupage county  illinois and a ppo product in pinellas county  florida 
on november   the department of labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under erisa 
the claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by erisa  whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are self funded 
as a result  the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and union sponsored health and disability plans  except church and government plans 
similar to legislation recently passed by many states  the new erisa claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals 
according to the department of labor  however  its erisa claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines  unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new erisa regulation impossible 
unlike its state counterparts  the erisa claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions 
instead  the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid state mandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court 
the new erisa claims and appeals rules generally became effective july  or the first day of the first plan year beginning after july   whichever is later 
in any case  health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after january  the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions  establishing uniform health care provider  payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules  we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions 
the compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to october  based on our submission of a compliance plan  including work plan and implementation strategy to the secretary of health and human services 
under the new hipaa privacy rules  by april  we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information  establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health 
table of contents information is disclosed 
regulations issued in february set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april  violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties 
compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements  training and administrative effort 
the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws  but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 
hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 
further in  congress passed the financial services modernization act  or gramm leach bliley act  that includes provisions related to privacy standards for personal information to be implemented by both the federal government and the states 
this law became effective in july many states are currently enacting laws or regulations to implement the federal law 
we are complying with such provisions 
there are several other legislative proposals under consideration that include  among other things  a patient bill of rights  expansion of a patient s right to sue and mandatory external review of health plan coverage decisions 
under some versions of this bill  our exposure to large jury verdicts could be increased 
in addition  congress is evaluating proposals to include establishing additional protections for personal health information  tax credits for the uninsured  proposals to reduce the number of medical errors by health care providers and systems of care  and various state and federal purchasing plans to allow individuals and small employers to purchase health insurance 
also  congress is evaluating proposals to expand medicare benefits to cover prescription drugs for medicare eligible seniors including a pharmacy discount card 
many of these proposals may require additional administrative costs to ensure compliance and we are currently assessing their cost and impact on premiums for the future 
state we continue to encounter regulation on health care claims payment practices at the state level 
this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose us to additional liability and penalties 
supplemental legislation includes among other provisions claims submission content and electronic submission 
we view electronic submission as a favorable development that will simplify claims interactions 
a few states are considering proposals that place new limits on insurer contacts with hospitals and physicians 
these proposals include provisions to expand payment disclosure  limit implementation of claims payment procedures  and extend an insurer payment liability where intermediaries fail to pay and restrict recoupment 
some states are proposing the creation of small employer pooled purchasing arrangements 
although these pooled purchasing arrangements may affect the small group market  most of the proposals require these purchasing arrangements to comply with the standard small group market regulations 
similar arrangements enacted in the early s had a very limited affect on the small group insurance market 
a limited number of states are considering additional restrictions on the use of health status in small group rating 
mandate free benefit plans are pending in a number of states 
some of these proposals could allow insurers more flexibility in the use of member cost sharing 
there is activity in some states supporting an expansion of disclosure by hospitals  physicians and other health care providers of quality and charge data either directly to patients or to state agencies that must make it publicly available 
medical malpractice reform is receiving significant attention 
pending medical malpractice reform proposals differ substantially relative to the entities covered by the reforms 
since the substance of the reforms remains under discussion and the scope of covered entities has not been resolved in most states  management is unable to predict future activity under these laws 
we are unable to predict how existing federal or state laws and regulations may be changed or interpreted  what additional laws or regulations affecting our businesses may be enacted or proposed  when and which of the proposed laws will be adopted or what effect any such new laws and regulations will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents other captive insurance company we bear general business risks associated with operating our company such as professional and general liability  employee workers compensation  and officer and director errors and omissions risks 
professional and general liability risks may include  for example  medical malpractice claims and disputes with members regarding benefit coverage

we reduce exposure to our own general business risks by insuring levels of coverage for losses in excess of our retained limits with a number of third party insurance companies 
we remain liable in the event these insurance companies are unable to pay their portion of the losses 
in an effort to minimize credit risk  we insure our risks with a number of insurance companies having a long history of strong financial ratings 
beginning january   we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates 
we provide a detail of the significant assets and liabilities related to our captive insurance subsidiary in note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents item legal proceedings securities litigation in late  three purported class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of florida by former stockholders of physician corporation of america  or pca  and certain of its former directors and officers 
we acquired pca by a merger that became effective on september  the three actions were consolidated into a single action entitled in re physician corporation of america securities litigation 
the consolidated complaint alleges that pca and the individual defendants knowingly or recklessly made false and misleading statements in press releases and public filings with respect to the financial and regulatory difficulties of pca s workers compensation business 
on may   plaintiffs moved for certification of the purported class  and on august   the defendants moved for summary judgment 
on january   defendants were granted leave to file a third party complaint for declaratory judgment on insurance coverage 
the defendants seek a determination that the defense costs and liability  if any  resulting from the class action defense are covered by an insurance policy issued by one insurer and  in the alternative  declaring that there is coverage under policies issued by two other insurers 
on april   the court dismissed the third party complaint without prejudice finding that it could be refiled in the future if the insurance claims are not otherwise resolved 
on july   the court denied the defendants motion for summary judgment and set the case on the court s trial calendar for december  the court subsequently postponed the trial 
the court is expected to set a date which is days after it rules on the plaintiff s motion for class certification 
managed care industry purported class action litigation we are involved in several purported class action lawsuits that are part of a wave of generally similar actions that target the health care payer industry and particularly target managed care companies 
as a result of action by the judicial panel on multi district litigation  most of the cases against us  as well as similar cases against other companies in the industry  have been consolidated in the united states district court for the southern district of florida  and are styled in re managed care litigation 
the cases include separate suits against us and five other managed care companies that purport to have been brought on behalf of members  which are referred to as the subscriber track cases  and a single action against us and eight other companies that purports to have been brought on behalf of providers  which is referred to as the provider track case 
in the subscriber track cases  the plaintiffs seek a recovery under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act  or rico  for all persons who are or were subscribers at any time during the four year period prior to the filing of the complaints 
plaintiffs also seek to represent a subclass of policyholders who purchased insurance through their employers health benefit plans governed by erisa  and who are or were subscribers at any time during the six year period prior to the filing of the complaints 
the complaints allege  among other things  that we intentionally concealed from members certain information concerning the way in which we conduct business  including the methods by which we pay providers 
the plaintiffs do not allege that any of the purported practices resulted in denial of any claim for a particular benefit  but instead  claim that we provided the purported class with health insurance benefits of lesser value than promised 
the complaints also allege an industry wide conspiracy to engage in the various alleged improper practices 
on february   the court issued its ruling on the defendants motions to dismiss the second consolidated amended complaint the amended complaint 
the amended complaint was filed on june   after the court dismissed most of the claims in the original complaints  but granted leave to refile 
in its february   ruling  the court dismissed the rico claims of ten of the sixteen named plaintiffs  including three of the four involving us  on the ground that the mccarran ferguson act prohibited their claims because they interfered with the state regulatory processes in the states in which they resided florida  new jersey  california and virginia 
with respect to erisa  the court dismissed the misrepresentation claims of current members  finding that they have adequate remedies under the law and failed to exhaust administrative remedies 
claims for former members were not dismissed 
the court also refused to dismiss claims by all plaintiffs for breach of fiduciary duty arising from alleged interference with the doctor patient relationship by the use of so called gag clauses that assertedly prohibited doctors from freely communicating with members 
the plaintiffs 
table of contents sought certification of a class consisting of all members of our medical plans  excluding medicare and medicaid plans  for the period from to on september   the court denied the plaintiffs request for class certification 
on october   the plaintiffs asked the court to reconsider its ruling on that issue 
the court denied the motion on november  the court has set a trial date on the individual named plaintiffs claims for september  in the provider track case  the plaintiffs assert that we and other defendants improperly paid providers claims and downcoded their claims by paying lesser amounts than they submitted 
the complaint alleges  among other things  multiple violations under rico as well as various breaches of contract and violations of regulations governing the timeliness of claim payments 
we moved to dismiss the provider track complaint on september   and the other defendants filed similar motions thereafter 
on march   the court dismissed certain of the plaintiffs claims pursuant to the defendants several motions to dismiss 
however  the court allowed the plaintiffs to attempt to correct the deficiencies in their complaint with an amended pleading with respect to all of the allegations except a claim under the federal medicare regulations  which was dismissed with prejudice 
the court also left undisturbed the plaintiffs claims for breach of contract 
on march   the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint  which  among other things  added four state or county medical associations as additional plaintiffs 
two of those  the denton county medical society and the texas medical association  purport to bring their actions against us  as well as against several other defendant companies 
the medical association of georgia and the california medical association purport to bring their actions against various other defendant companies 
the associations seek injunctive relief only 
the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on april  on september   the court granted the plaintiffs request to file a second amended complaint  adding additional plaintiffs  including the florida medical association  which purports to bring its action against all defendants 
on october   the defendants moved to dismiss the second amended complaint 
the court has not yet ruled 
also on september   the court certified a global class consisting of all medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by any defendant from august   to september  the class includes two subclasses 
a national subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured by a defendant when the doctor has a claim against such defendant and is not required to arbitrate that claim 
a california subclass consists of medical doctors who provided services to any person insured in california by any defendant when the doctor was not bound to arbitrate the claim 
on october   the defendants asked the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit to review the class certification decision 
on november   the court of appeals agreed to review the class issue 
the district court has ruled that discovery can proceed during the pendency of the request to the eleventh circuit  and the eleventh circuit rejected a request to halt discovery 
the court has set a trial date of december  other the academy of medicine of cincinnati  the butler county medical society  the northern kentucky medical society and several physicians have filed antitrust suits against aetna health  inc  humana health plan of ohio  inc  anthem blue cross blue shield  and united healthcare of ohio  inc  alleging that the defendants have conspired to fix the reimbursement rates paid to physicians in the greater cincinnati and northern kentucky region 
the companion suits are filed in state courts in ohio and kentucky and allege violation  respectively  of the ohio and kentucky antitrust laws 
each suit seeks class certification  damages and injunctive relief 
plaintiffs cite no evidence that any such conspiracy existed  but base their allegations on assertions that physicians in the greater cincinnati region are paid less than physicians in other major cities in ohio and kentucky 
the hamilton county court of common pleas ohio and the boone county circuit court kentucky have denied motions by the defendants to compel arbitration or alternatively to dismiss 
defendants have filed notices 
table of contents of appeal with respect to the orders denying arbitration 
the ohio court has agreed to stay proceedings pending resolution of the appeal  and a similar request has been filed with the kentucky court 
the plaintiffs have filed motions to certify a class in each case 
the purported classes allegedly consist  respectively  of all physicians who have practiced medicine at any time since january   in a four county region in southwestern ohio or a three county region in northern kentucky 
we intend to continue to defend these actions vigorously 
government audits and other litigation and proceedings in july  the office of the florida attorney general initiated an investigation  apparently relating to some of the same matters that are involved in the purported class action lawsuits described above 
while the attorney general has filed no action against us  he has indicated that he may do so in the future 
on september   the texas attorney general initiated a similar investigation 
these investigations are ongoing  and we have cooperated with the regulators in both states 
on may   we entered into a five year corporate integrity agreement  or cia  with the office of inspector general  or oig  of the department of health and human services 
under the cia  we are obligated to  among other things  provide training  conduct periodic audits and make periodic reports to the oig 
in addition  our business practices are subject to review by various state insurance and health care regulatory authorities and federal regulatory authorities 
there has been increased scrutiny by these regulators of the managed health care companies business practices  including claims payment practices and utilization management practices 
we have been and continue to be subject to such reviews 
some of these have resulted in fines and could require changes in some of our practices and could also result in additional fines or other sanctions 
we also are involved in other lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of our business operations  including claims of medical malpractice both for direct negligence and for vicarious liability for negligence of network providers  bad faith  nonacceptance or termination of providers  failure to disclose network discounts and various other provider arrangements  and challenges to subrogation practices 
we also are subject to claims relating to performance of contractual obligations to providers and others  including failure to properly pay claims and challenges to the use of certain software products in processing claims 
pending state and federal legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
in addition  some courts recently have issued decisions which could have the effect of eroding the scope of erisa preemption  thereby exposing us to greater liability for medical negligence claims 
personal injury claims and claims for extracontractual damages arising from medical benefit denials are covered by insurance from our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary and excess carriers  except to the extent that claimants seek punitive damages  which may not be covered by insurance in certain states in which insurance coverage for punitive damages is not permitted 
in addition  insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability has become increasingly costly and may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
beginning january   we reduced the amount of coverage purchased from third party insurance carriers and increased the amount of risk we retain due to substantially higher insurance rates 
we do not believe that any pending or threatened legal actions against us or audits by agencies will have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  the likelihood or outcome of current or future suits  like the purported class action lawsuits described above  or governmental investigations  cannot be accurately predicted with certainty 
in addition  the increased litigation  which has accompanied the negative publicity and public perception of our industry  adds to this uncertainty 
therefore  such legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

introduction headquartered in louisville  kentucky  humana inc is one of the nation s largest publicly traded health benefits companies  based on our revenues of billion 
we offer coordinated health insurance coverage and related services through a variety of traditional and internet based plans for employer groups  government sponsored programs  and individuals 
as of december   we had approximately million members in our medical insurance programs  as well as approximately million members in our specialty products programs 
we have approximately  contracts with physicians  hospitals  dentists and other providers to provide health care to our members 
in  approximately of our premiums and administrative services fees resulted from members located in florida  illinois  texas  kentucky  and ohio 
we derived approximately of our premiums and administrative services fees from contracts with the federal government in under two federal government contracts with the department of defense  we provide health insurance coverage to tricare members  accounting for approximately of our total premiums and administrative services fees in under one federal government contract with the centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  we provide health insurance coverage to approximately  medicare choice members in florida  accounting for approximately of our total premiums and administrative services fees in we manage our business with two segments commercial and government 
the commercial segment consists of members enrolled in products marketed to employer groups and individuals  and includes three lines of business fully insured medical  administrative services only  or aso  and specialty 
the government segment consists of members enrolled in government sponsored programs  and includes three lines of business medicare choice  medicaid  and tricare 
we identified our segments in accordance with the aggregation provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information which is consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in managing our business 
the segment information aggregates products with similar economic characteristics 
these characteristics include the nature of customer groups and pricing  benefits and underwriting requirements 
the results of each segment are measured by income before income taxes 
we allocate all selling  general and administrative expenses  investment and other income  interest expense  and goodwill  but no other assets or liabilities  to our segments 
members served by our two segments generally utilize the same medical provider networks  enabling us to obtain more favorable contract terms with providers 
our segments also share overhead costs and assets 
as a result  the profitability of each segment is interdependent 
our business strategy centers on increasing commercial segment profitability while maintaining our existing strength in the government segment 
our strategy to increase commercial segment profitability focuses 
table of contents on providing solutions for employers to the rising cost of health care through the use of innovative and consumer centric product designs which are supported by service excellence and industry leading electronic capabilities  including education  tools and technologies provided primarily through the internet 
the intent of our commercial segment strategy is to enable us to further penetrate high potential commercial markets and to transform the traditional consumer experience for both employers and members to result in a high degree of consumer satisfaction  loyalty and brand awareness 
we are in the process of reducing our administrative cost structure primarily to support our commercial strategy 
restructuring charge during the fourth quarter of  we finalized a plan to reduce our administrative cost structure with the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction 
the following table presents the components of the restructuring charge we recorded for the year ended december  charge cash payments non cash balance at december  expected future cash outlays in thousands severance and related employee benefits long lived asset impairment leased equipment discontinuance costs total restructuring charges severance during the fourth quarter of  we recorded severance and related employee benefit costs of million million after tax in connection with customer service center consolidation and an enterprise wide workforce reduction 
severance costs were estimated based upon the provisions of the company s existing employee benefit plans and policies 
the plan to reduce our administrative cost structure is expected to affect approximately  positions throughout the entire organization including customer service  claim administrations  clinical operations  provider network administration  as well as other corporate and field based positions 
as part of the plan  we expect to hire approximately employees to support newly consolidated operations  thereby resulting in a net reduction of approximately  employees 
as of december   approximately positions had been eliminated 
we expect the remaining positions to be eliminated by december   with most of the severance being paid in as a result of these actions  we expect a reduction in historical compensation expense will improve our pretax results by approximately million million after tax in and million million after tax annually thereafter and after tax cash flows from operating activities by approximately million in including estimated severance payments of approximately million and million annually thereafter 
long lived asset impairment our decision to eliminate three customer service centers prompted a review during the fourth quarter of for the possible impairment of long lived assets used in these operations 
we will continue to use some long lived assets associated with these customer service center operations until mid  the expected completion date for consolidating these operations 
we are currently evaluating alternatives with respect to future use of these long lived assets  including possible sale 
our impairment review indicated that future estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to our business supported by our san antonio  texas customer service operations were insufficient to recover the carrying value 
table of contents of certain long lived assets  primarily buildings used in these operations 
accordingly  we adjusted the carrying value of these long lived assets to their estimated fair value resulting in a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax 
estimated fair value was based on an independent third party appraisal of the buildings 
by the end of the first quarter of  we expect the estimated future undiscounted cash flow attributable to our business supported by our jacksonville  florida customer service operations will be insufficient to recover the carrying value of additional long lived assets  primarily a building used in our florida operations 
accordingly  we expect to record a non cash impairment charge of approximately million million after tax during the first quarter of additionally  we expect to record a non cash impairment charge of approximately million during the first quarter of million after tax related to accelerated depreciation of software we will cease using with these operations 
as a result of these actions  we expect a reduction in historical depreciation and rent expense will improve our pretax results by approximately million million after tax in and million million after tax annually thereafter 
the impact on operating cash flows is not expected to be material 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we continuously evaluate our estimates and those critical accounting policies related primarily to medical cost and revenue recognition as well as accounting for impairments related to our investment securities  goodwill  and long lived assets 
these estimates are based on knowledge of current events and anticipated future events  and accordingly  actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
medical cost recognition medical costs include claim payments  capitation payments  allocations of certain centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to members  as well as estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided prior to the balance sheet date 
capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to primary care physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members 
we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other medical expense payments using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns  medical cost inflation  historical developments such as claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns  and other relevant factors  and record medical claims reserves for future payments 
we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 
medical cost inflation  among other items  may significantly impact our estimate of medical costs 
medical cost inflationary trends today are substantially higher than other segments of the economy 
in the early s employer driven migration to hmo enrollment was popular and resulted in several years of very low medical cost trends 
today  there are very few economic forces existing to mitigate increases in the utilization of hospital and physician services  prescription drugs and new medical technologies  and the inflationary trend on the cost per unit for each of these expense components 
additionally  as we are realigning our operating model around our commercial strategy  we continue to reduce the level of traditional utilization management functions such as pre authorization of services  monitoring of inpatient admissions and requirements for physician referrals 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may also impact cost trends 

table of contents any of the items above  or other unforeseen circumstances  may result in actual medical cost trends differing materially from our estimates and a relatively small variance between our estimates of medical cost trends and actual trends could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of our medical claims reserves and our overall financial position 
for example  a basis point  or percent  change in the estimate of our medical and other expenses payable at december   which represents of total liabilities  would require an adjustment of million in a future period in which the revision in the estimate becomes known 
a basis point change in estimated medical expense trends would have changed annual pretax results of our commercial segment by million and our government segment by million in note in our consolidated financial statements presents a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances for medical and other expenses payable 
the table includes the changes in estimates of medical claims payable subsequently recorded to each year 
a summary of these changes in estimates and percentage of beginning medical claim reserves follows year ended december  amount percentage of beginning reserves percentage of medical expenses variance in millions unfavorable development favorable development favorable development revenue recognition we generally establish one year commercial membership contracts with employer groups  subject to cancellation by the employer group s written notice 
our tricare contracts with the federal government and our contracts with various state medicaid programs are generally multi year contracts subject to annual renewal provisions 
our medicare choice contracts with the federal government renew annually 
we bill and collect premium and administrative fee remittances from employer groups and some individual medicare choice members monthly 
we receive monthly premiums and administrative fees from the federal government and various states according to government specified reimbursement rates and various contractual terms 
premium revenues are recognized as income in the period members are entitled to receive services  and are net of estimated uncollectible amounts and retroactive membership adjustments 
retroactive membership adjustments result from enrollment changes not yet processed  or not yet reported by an employer group or the government 
we routinely monitor the collectibility of specific accounts  the aging of receivables  historical retroactivity trends  as well as prevailing and anticipated economic conditions  and any required adjustments are reflected in current operations 
administrative services only fees  or aso  are earned as services are performed 
administrative services fees cover the processing of claims  offering access to our provider networks and clinical programs  and responding to customer service inquiries from members of self funded employers 
under aso contracts  self funded employers and  for tricare aso  the department of defense  retain the risk of financing the cost of health benefits 
premium and aso receivables are shown net of allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts and retroactive membership adjustments 
premiums and aso fees received prior to the period members are entitled to receive services are recorded as unearned revenues 

table of contents tricare revenues base premium revenues as originally specified in our tricare contracts are recognized ratably throughout each contract year as eligible beneficiaries are entitled to receive services 
tricare revenues also include estimates for amounts recoverable from the federal government as a result of bid price adjustments  or bpas  and change orders 
under our tricare contracts  we retain the financial risk of contractual discounts in the provider networks  same store utilization of services and administrative overhead 
however  the federal government retains the financial risk associated with changes in usage levels at military treatment facilities  or mtf  changes in the number of persons eligible for tricare benefits and medical unit cost inflation 
bpas are utilized to retroactively adjust premium revenues for the impact of the items for which the federal government retains risk 
we work closely with the federal government to obtain and review eligibility and mtf workload data  and to quantify and negotiate amounts recoverable or payable under our contractual bpa requirements 
we record revenues applicable to bpas when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
because final settlement of bpas occurs only at specified intervals  typically in excess of months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions  cumulative amounts receivable or payable under bpas may be outstanding in excess of a year 
amounts receivable or payable within a year are classified as premiums receivable or trade accounts payable and accrued expenses  respectively  in our consolidated balance sheets 
amounts receivable or payable for longer than one year are classified as other long term assets or other long term liabilities  respectively 
as a result of the events of september   the subsequent build up of military personnel to support military operations in afghanistan and the continuing build up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions  the magnitude of bpa activity is currently much more significant than in prior years 
tricare change orders occur when we perform services or incur costs under the directive of the federal government that were not originally specified in our contracts 
under federal regulations we are entitled to an equitable adjustment to the contract price  which results in additional premium revenues 
examples of items that have necessitated substantial change orders in recent years include congressionally legislated increases in the level of benefits for tricare beneficiaries and the administration of new government programs such as tricare for life and tricare senior pharmacy 
like bpas  we record revenue applicable to change orders when these amounts are determinable and the collectibility is reasonably assured 
unlike bpas  where settlement only occurs at specified intervals  change orders may be negotiated and settled at any time throughout the year

table of contents our tricare contracts also contain risk sharing provisions with the federal government to minimize any losses and limit any profits in the event that medical costs for which we are at risk differ from the levels targeted in our contracts 
amounts receivable from the federal government under such risk sharing provisions are included in the bpa receivable above  while amounts payable to the federal government under these provisions of approximately million are included in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
investment securities investment securities totaled  million  or of total assets at december  debt securities totaled  million  or of our total investment portfolio 
the average duration of our debt securities was approximately years and more than of our debt securities were of investment grade quality with an average of aa by standard poor s at december  most of the debt securities that are below investment grade are rated at the higher end of the non investment grade spectrum 
our investment policy limits investments in a single issuer and requires diversification among various asset types 
our investment securities are categorized as available for sale and  as a result  are stated at fair value 
fair value of publicly traded debt and equity securities are based on quoted market prices 
non traded debt securities are priced independently by a third party vendor 
fair value of strategic venture capital debt and equity securities that are privately held  or where an observable quoted market price does not exist  are estimated using a variety of valuation methodologies 
such methodologies include reviewing the value ascribed to the most recent financing  comparing the security with securities of publicly traded companies in a similar line of business  and reviewing the underlying financial performance including estimating discounted cash flows 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are included as a component of stockholders equity until realized from a sale or impairment 
gross unrealized losses totaled million  or of our total investment portfolio at december  compared to million  or at december  we had no material unrealized loss on any one individual investment security or within any one industry at december  we regularly evaluate our investment securities for impairment 
we consider factors affecting the investee  factors affecting the industry the investee operates within  and general debt and equity market trends 
we consider the length of time an investment s fair value has been below carrying value  the near term prospects for recovery to carrying value and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or market recovery is realized 
if and when a determination is made that a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary  the related investment is written down to its estimated fair value through earnings 
the risks inherent in assessing the impairment of an investment include the risk that market factors may differ from our expectations  facts and circumstances factored into our assessment may change with the passage of time  or we may decide to subsequently sell the investment 
the determination of whether a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary requires us to exercise significant diligence and judgment 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 
gross realized losses in included impairment losses of million related to privately held investment securities after an evaluation indicated that a decline in fair value below the cost basis was other than temporary 
goodwill and long lived asset at december   goodwill and other long lived assets represented of total assets and of total stockholders equity 

table of contents goodwill is no longer amortized but must be tested at least annually for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as the reporting unit and more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
a reporting unit is one level below our commercial and government segments 
the commercial segment s two reporting units consist of fully and self insured medical and specialty 
the government segment s three reporting units consist of medicare choice  tricare and medicaid 
goodwill was assigned to the reporting unit that was expected to benefit from a specific acquisition 
if goodwill was expected to benefit multiple reporting units  we allocated goodwill in connection with our transitional impairment test as of january  based upon the reporting units relative fair value 
this process resulted in the allocation of million of goodwill to the commercial segment and million of goodwill to the government segment 
our long range business plan and annual planning process supports our goodwill impairment tests 
these tests are based primarily on an evaluation of future discounted cash flows under several scenarios 
we used a range of discount rates that correspond to our weighted average cost of capital 
key assumptions including changes in membership  premium yields  medical cost trends and certain government contract extensions are consistent with those utilized in our long range business plan and annual planning process 
if these assumptions differ from actual  the estimates underlying our goodwill impairment tests could be adversely affected 
long lived assets consist of property and equipment and other intangible assets 
these assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful life  and are subject to impairment reviews 
we periodically review long lived assets whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing recoverability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine if an impairment loss may exist  and  if so  estimate fair value 
we also must estimate and make assumptions regarding the useful life we assign to our long lived assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment losses or change the useful life  including accelerating depreciation for these assets 
in  we recognized long lived asset impairment losses of million as a result of our decision to eliminate three customer service centers 
we expect to recognize additional long lived asset impairment losses of approximately million in related to these service center consolidation initiatives

recent transactions acquisitions on may   we acquired the outstanding shares of common stock of a newly formed anthem health insurance company subsidiary responsible for administering tricare benefits in regions and for million in cash  net of direct transaction costs 
during  in separate transactions  we acquired a houston based health plan  two operating shell entities for future business initiatives  and a hospital in patient management services firm for million in cash  net of direct transaction costs 
we accounted for each of these acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  our consolidated results of operations include the results of the acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
for each acquisition  we allocated the purchase price to net tangible and other intangible assets based upon their fair values 
any remaining value not assigned to net tangible or other intangible assets was then allocated to goodwill 
other intangible assets primarily relate to government  subscriber and provider contracts and the cost of the acquired licenses 
goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisitions were million in and million in the other intangible assets are being amortized over periods ranging from to years  with a weighted average life of years

premium revenues and medical membership premium revenues increased to billion for  compared to billion for higher premium revenues resulted primarily from significant commercial premium yields and an increase in tricare premiums 
premium yield represents the percentage increase in the average premium per member over the comparable period in the prior year 
items impacting premium yield include changes in premium rates  changes in government reimbursement rates  changes in geographic mix of membership  and changes in the mix of benefit plans selected by our membership

additionally  our fully insured commercial medical membership increased or  members  to  at december  compared to  at december  we have been pricing premiums using the assumption that medical cost trends will accelerate slightly and accordingly  anticipate commercial premium yields in the to range

government segment premium revenues increased to billion for  compared to billion for this increase was primarily attributable to our tricare business  partially offset by a reduction in our medicare choice membership 
tricare premium revenues were billion  an increase of million  or compared to million of the increase in tricare premium revenues is attributable to the acquisition of regions and on may   with the remainder of the increase attributable to the annual increase in our contractually determined base revenues and increases in premium revenues recorded as a result of bid price adjustments  or bpas  and change orders 

table of contents increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with bpas resulted from an increase in the number of eligible tricare beneficiaries and a decrease in the use of military treatment facilities  or mtfs  by tricare beneficiaries 
the number of tricare beneficiaries has increased as a result of the events of september   the subsequent build up of military personnel to support military operations in afghanistan and the continuing build up of military personnel surrounding other international tensions 
a decline in the usage of mtfs occurred for some periods after september  when certain mtfs were restricted by the department of defense resulting in a greater use of our provider network by retired military personnel and the dependents of both active duty and retired military personnel 
increasing premium revenues recorded in connection with change orders primarily resulted from expanded benefits for tricare beneficiaries as mandated by congress which includes  among other items  a reduction of beneficiary out of pocket maximum cost and the elimination of certain copayments 
collectively  all of these actions resulted in higher medical expenses during since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts  we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments via the change order and bid price adjustment process 
we recognized revenues related to these adjustments when the settlement amount became determinable and the collectibility was reasonably assured 
medicare choice premium revenues were billion in  a decrease of from billion in medicare choice membership was  at december   compared to  at december   a decline of  members  or

administrative services fees administrative services fees for were million  an increase of million from million for for the commercial segment  administrative services fees increased million  or  to million 
this increase corresponds to the higher level of aso membership at december   which was  members  compared to  members at december  and also reflects an increase in the average fees received per member

table of contents membership to a heavier concentration of larger group sizes 
large group commercial membership represents approximately of our fully insured commercial membership at december  compared to at december  large group membership traditionally experiences a higher medical expense ratio and a lower selling  general and administrative expense ratio than does our small group membership 
the government segment medical expense ratio for was  increasing basis points from for this increase primarily was attributable to tricare 
as discussed previously  tricare medical expense increased due to expanded benefits for tricare beneficiaries mandated by congress  an increase in eligible beneficiaries  and an increase in the use of humana s provider network rather than military treatment facilities 
since these actions were not originally specified in our contracts or were for items that the department of defense retains financial risk  we were entitled to equitable revenue adjustments through the change order and bid price adjustment processes 
these higher medical expenses combined with the associated higher premium revenues resulted in an overall increase in the government medical expense ratio

of the total million of administrative expenses  which amounts to a basis point increase in the sg a expense ratio  million impacted our commercial segment and million impacted our government segment 
the commercial segment s sg a expense ratio was for  decreasing basis points from of 
the pca items discussed above accounted for a basis point increase in this ratio 
the remaining basis point decline in the sg a ratio was driven primarily by the changing mix of members towards more larger group members and reductions in the number of our employees due to operational efficiencies gained from streamlining various processes through technology and other initiatives 
costs to distribute and administer our products to large group members are lower than that of small group members 
the government segment s sg a expense ratio was for  increasing basis points compared to in this increase resulted from a higher proportion of revenues generated from administrative services fees  primarily from the tricare regions and acquisition and the implementation of the tricare for life benefit programs effective october   as discussed above 
aso business carries a much higher sg a ratio than fully insured business 
we expect our total sg a expense ratio to decline by approximately basis points in due to our plan to realign our operating model around our commercial strategy and reductions in our administrative cost structure  including the consolidation of seven customer service centers into four and an enterprise wide workforce reduction

table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate in of decreased compared to the effective tax rate in the lower effective tax rate in primarily resulted from the cessation of non deductible goodwill amortization on january   partially offset by higher state income taxes and a lower proportion of tax exempt investment income to pretax income 
in addition  during  the internal revenue service completed their audit of all open years prior to which resulted in a favorable adjustment to the estimated accrual for income taxes of approximately million 
this was offset by an increase of approximately million in the capital loss valuation allowance after we reevaluated probable capital gain realization in the allowable carryforward period based upon our capital gain experience beginning in and consideration of alternative tax planning strategies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete reconciliation to the federal statutory rate

the timing of bpa collections occurs at contractually specified intervals  typically in excess of months after the end of a contract year for our largest regions 
we classified a portion of the total bpa receivables associated with our regions and tricare contract as long term because the federal government is not obligated to pay us the amounts until january we also have a bpa amount payable within one year under the regions and contract of approximately million at december   which is classified in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets

interest rate swap agreements  which are considered derivatives  are contracts that exchange interest payments on a specified principal amount  or notional amount  for a specified period 
our interest rate swap agreements exchange the fixed interest rate under our senior notes for a variable interest rate  which was at december  the million swap agreements mature on august   and have the same critical terms as our senior notes 
changes in the fair value of the senior notes and the swap agreements due to changing interest rates are assumed to offset each other completely  resulting in no impact to earnings from hedge ineffectiveness 
our swap agreements are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value with an equal and offsetting adjustment to the carrying value of our senior notes 
the fair value of our swap agreements are estimated based on quoted market prices of comparable agreements and reflects the amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the agreements at the reporting date 
at december   the million fair value of our swap agreements is included in other long term assets 
likewise  the carrying value of our senior notes has been increased million to its fair value 
the counterparties to our swap agreements are major financial institutions with which we also have other financial relationships 
credit agreements we maintain two unsecured revolving credit agreements consisting of a million  year revolving credit agreement and a million  day revolving credit agreement with a one year term out option 
a one year term out option converts the outstanding borrowings  if any  under the credit agreement to a one year term loan upon expiration 
the year revolving credit agreement expires in october in october  we renewed the day revolving credit agreement which expires in october  unless extended 
there were no balances outstanding under either agreement at december  under these agreements  at our option  we can borrow on either a competitive advance basis or a revolving credit basis 
the revolving credit portion of both agreements bear interest at either a fixed rate or floating rate based on libor plus a spread 
the spread  which varies depending on our credit ratings  ranges from to basis points for our year agreement  and to basis points for our day agreement 
we also pay an annual facility fee 
table of contents regardless of utilization 
this facility fee  currently basis points  may fluctuate between and basis points  depending upon our credit ratings 
the competitive advance portion of any borrowings under either credit agreement will bear interest at market rates prevailing at the time of borrowing on either a fixed rate or a floating rate basis  at our option 
these credit agreements contain customary restrictive and financial covenants as well as customary events of default  including financial covenants regarding the maintenance of net worth  and minimum interest coverage and maximum leverage ratios 
the terms of each of these credit agreements also include standard provisions related to conditions of borrowing  including a customary material adverse effect clause which could limit our ability to borrow 
we have not experienced a material adverse effect and we know of no circumstances or events which would be reasonably likely to result in a material adverse effect 
we do not believe the material adverse effect clause poses a material funding risk to humana in the future 
the minimum net worth requirement was  million at december  and increases by of consolidated net income each quarter 
the minimum interest coverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing interest expense into earnings before interest and tax expense  or ebit 
the maximum leverage ratio is generally calculated by dividing debt into earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense  or ebitda 
ebit and ebitda used to calculate compliance with these financial covenants is based upon four consecutive quarters 
the current minimum interest coverage ratio of  increases to effective december  the current maximum leverage ratio of declines to effective december  at december   our net worth of  million  interest coverage ratio of  and leverage ratio of were all in compliance with the applicable requirements 
additionally  we would have been in compliance assuming the more restrictive future financial covenant requirements were applicable at december  commercial paper programs we maintain indirect access to the commercial paper market through our conduit commercial paper financing program 
under this program  a third party issues commercial paper and loans the proceeds of those issuances to us so that the interest and principal payments on the loans match those on the underlying commercial paper 
the million  day revolving credit agreement supports the conduit commercial paper financing program of up to million 
the weighted average interest rate on our conduit commercial paper borrowings was at december  the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rate on the borrowings varies at market rates 
we also maintain and may issue short term debt securities under a commercial paper program when market conditions allow 
the program is backed by our credit agreements described above 
aggregate borrowing under both the credit agreements and commercial paper program cannot exceed million 
other borrowings other borrowings of million at december  represent financing for the renovation of a building  bear interest at and are payable in various installments through shelf registration on october   we filed a universal shelf registration with the sec to register debt or equity securities  from time to time  up to a total of million  with the amount  price and terms to be determined at the time of the sale 
once it becomes effective  we will have the ability to use the net proceeds from any future sales of our securities for our operations and for other general corporate purposes  including repayment or refinancing of borrowings  working capital  capital expenditures  investments  acquisitions  or the repurchase of our outstanding securities 

table of contents contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements we are contractually obligated to make payments for years subsequent to december  as follows payments due by period total year years years after years in thousands debt operating leases total debt payments could be accelerated upon violation of debt covenants 
we believe the likelihood of a debt covenant violation is remote 
we lease facilities  computer hardware  and other equipment under long term operating leases that are noncancelable and expire on various dates through we sublease facilities or partial facilities to third party tenants for space not used in our operations which partially mitigates our operating lease commitments 
an operating lease is a type of off balance sheet arrangement 
assuming we acquired the asset  rather than leased  we would have recognized a liability for the financing of these assets 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
our year and year airplane operating leases which are included above provide for a residual value guarantee of no more than million at the end of the lease terms which expire december  for the year leases and january  for the year lease 
we have the right to exercise a purchase option with respect to the leased equipment or the equipment can be sold to a third party 
if we decide not to exercise our purchase option at the end of the lease  we must pay the lessor a maximum amount of million related to the year leases and million related to the year lease 
the amount will be reduced by the net sales proceeds of the airplanes to a third party 
a million gain in connection with a sale leaseback transaction is being deferred until the residual value guarantee is resolved at the end of the lease term 
we do not believe that we will have any payment obligation at the end of the lease because we will exercise the purchase obligation  or the net proceeds from the sale of the airplanes will exceed the maximum amount payable to the lessor 
we have million in undrawn letters of credit outstanding at december  letters of credit totaling million have been issued to ensure our payment to a beneficiary for assumed obligations of our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary related to pre professional liability risks for which the beneficiary remains directly liable 
other letters of credit totaling million were issued to ensure our payment to various beneficiaries for miscellaneous contractual obligations 
these letters of credit renew automatically on an annual basis unless the beneficiary otherwise notifies us 
in february  a million letter of credit supporting miscellaneous contractual obligations of ours expired without renewal 
over the past years  we have not had to fund any letters of credit 
through indemnity agreements approved by the state regulatory authorities  certain of our regulated subsidiaries generally are guaranteed by humana inc  our parent company  in the event of insolvency for member coverage for which premium payment has been made prior to insolvency  benefits for members then hospitalized until discharged  and payment to providers for services rendered prior to insolvency 
other liquidity factors our investment grade credit rating at december  was baa according to moody s investors services  inc  or moody s and bbb  according to standard poor s corporation  or s p 
a downgrade to ba or lower by moody s and bb or lower by s p would give the counterparty of one of our interest rate swap agreements with a million notional amount  the right  but not the obligation  to cancel the interest rate swap agreement 
if cancelled  we would pay or receive an amount based on the fair market value of the swap 
table of contents agreement 
assuming this swap agreement had been cancelled on december   we would have received million 
other than the swap agreement  adverse changes in our credit ratings will not create  increase  or accelerate any liabilities 
adverse changes in our credit rating will increase the rate of interest we pay and may impact the amount of credit available to us in the future 
related parties no related party transactions had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain immaterial related party transactions are discussed in our proxy statement for the meeting to be held may  see certain transactions with management and others 
regulatory requirements certain of our subsidiaries operate in states that regulate the payment of dividends  loans or other cash transfers to humana inc  our parent company  require minimum levels of equity  and limit investments to approved securities 
the amount of dividends that may be paid to humana inc by these subsidiaries  without prior approval by state regulatory authorities  is limited based on the entity s level of statutory income and statutory capital and surplus 
in most states  prior notification is provided before paying a dividend even if approval is not required 
as of december   we maintained aggregate statutory capital and surplus of  million in our state regulated health insurance subsidiaries 
each of these subsidiaries was in compliance with applicable statutory requirements which aggregated million 
although the minimum required levels of equity are largely based on premium volume  product mix  and the quality of assets held  minimum requirements can vary significantly at the state level 
certain states rely on risk based capital requirements  or rbc  to define the required levels of equity 
rbc is a model developed by the national association of insurance commissioners to monitor an entity s solvency 
this calculation indicates recommended minimum levels of required capital and surplus and signals regulatory measures should actual surplus fall below these recommended levels 
some states are in the process of phasing in these rbc requirements over a number of years 
if rbc were fully implemented by all states at december   each of our subsidiaries would be in compliance  and we would have million of aggregate capital and surplus above the minimum level required under rbc 
one tricare subsidiary under the regions and contract with the department of defense is required to maintain current assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities 
we were in compliance with this requirement at december  future liquidity needs we believe that funds from future operating cash flows and funds available under our credit agreements and commercial paper program are sufficient to meet future liquidity needs 
we also believe these sources of funds are adequate to allow us to fund selected expansion opportunities  as well as to fund capital requirements 
market risk sensitive financial instruments and positions the level of our pretax earnings is subject to risk due to changes in investment income from our fixed income portfolio which is partially offset by both our debt position and the short term duration of the fixed income investment portfolio 
we evaluated the impact on our investment income and debt expense resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates of  and basis points over the next twelve month period  as reflected in the following table 
the modeling technique used to calculate the pro forma net change considered the cash flows related to fixed income investments and debt  which are subject to interest rate changes during a prospective twelve month

this evaluation measures parallel shifts in interest rates and may not account for certain unpredictable events that may effect interest income  including  among others  unexpected changes of cash flow into and out of the portfolio  shifts in the asset mix between tax and tax exempt securities  and spread changes specific to various investment categories 
in the past ten years  annual changes in month libor rates have exceeded basis points twice  have not changed between and basis points and have changed between and basis points once

government contracts our medicare choice contracts with the federal government are renewed for a one year term each december unless terminated days prior thereto 
legislative proposals are being considered which may revise the medicare choice program s current reimbursement rates 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact they may have on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
we currently are in negotiations with the department of defense to extend our tricare contracts that expire on april  for regions and and june  for regions and we believe we will be able to successfully extend our tricare contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a 
table of contents one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new tricare next generation  or t nex  transition described below 
historical pretax profit margins for our tricare business have generally ranged from to percent 
we expect margins to continue in this range during the department of defense recently announced a plan to consolidate the total number of prime contracts from seven to three under the new t nex program 
the department of defense has stated that a bidder can be awarded only one prime contract  although a bidder would be allowed to secondarily participate in another contract 
we submitted a bid in january to participate as a prime contractor for the south region 
additionally  we partnered with aetna government health plans  llc  a subsidiary of aetna  inc to participate as a subcontractor should aetna government health plans  llc be awarded the north region 
an announcement of the awards is expected in mid to late with transition to the new regions not expected until mid to late at this time we are unable to predict whether we will be awarded a contract  or the effective date of the contract 
if we are a successful bidder on the south region  we do not expect a material change to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows  although tricare profits could decline slightly 
tricare membership would not materially change from current levels 
tricare revenues and expenses would decline by approximately as a result of certain benefits  eg pharmacy  which are included under our current contract  being excluded and under separate t nex contracts in the future 
effective july   we signed two contracts in puerto rico covering beneficiaries in two of the eight regions in puerto rico s medicaid program  which represents of our total medicaid membership as of december  the term of each of these contracts is three years  subject to annual renewal options with the health insurance administration in puerto rico 
our medicaid contracts in florida and illinois generally are annual contracts 
the loss of any of these government contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action  including reductions in premium payments to us  or increases in member benefits without corresponding increases in premium payments to us  may have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
legal proceedings we are party to a variety of legal actions in the ordinary course of business  including employment matters  breach of contract actions  tort claims  and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under legal proceedings of item in part we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in defense of these matters 
in addition  recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
cautionary statements this document includes both historical and forward looking statements 
the forward looking statements are made within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of we intend such forward looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  and we are including this statement for purposes of complying with these safe harbor provisions 
we have based these forward looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events 
these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions  including  among other things  the information discussed below 
in making these statements  we are not undertaking to address or update each factor in future filings or communications regarding our business or results 
our business is highly complicated  regulated and competitive with many different factors affecting results 

table of contents if the premiums we charge are insufficient to cover the cost of health care services delivered to our members  or if our estimates of medical claim reserves are inadequate  our profitability could decline 
we use a significant portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members 
these costs include claims payments  capitation payments  allocations of some centralized expenses and various other costs incurred to provide health insurance coverage to our members 
these costs also include estimates of future payments to hospitals and others for medical care provided to our members 
generally  premiums in the health care business are fixed for one year periods 
accordingly  costs we incur in excess of our medical cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums 
we estimate the costs of our future medical claims and other expenses using actuarial methods and assumptions based upon claim payment patterns  medical inflation  historical developments  including claim inventory levels and claim receipt patterns  and other relevant factors 
we also record medical claims reserves for future payments 
we continually review estimates of future payments relating to medical claims costs for services incurred in the current and prior periods and make necessary adjustments to our reserves 
however  increased utilization or unit cost  competition  government regulations and many other factors may and often do cause actual health care costs to exceed what was estimated and reflected in premiums 
these factors may include increased use of medical facilities and services  including prescription drugs  increased cost of such services  termination of capitation arrangements resulting in the transfer of membership to fee for service arrangements  changes or reductions of our utilization management functions such as preauthorization of services  concurrent review or requirements for physician referrals  catastrophes or epidemics  the introduction of new or costly treatments  including new technologies  medical cost inflation  new government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  and increased use of health care  including doctors office visits and prescriptions resulting from terrorists attacks and subsequent terrorists threats  including bioterrorism 
failure to adequately price our products or estimate sufficient medical claim reserves may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
if we fail to effectively implement our operational and strategic initiatives  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our future performance depends in large part upon our management team s ability to execute our strategy to position the company for the future 
this strategy includes the growth of our commercial segment business  introduction of new products and benefit designs  the successful implementation of our e business initiatives and the selection and adoption of new technologies 
we believe that the adoption of new technologies will contribute toward a reduction in administrative costs as we more closely align our workforce with our membership 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our operational and strategic initiatives that are intended to position the company for future growth 
failure to implement this strategy may result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents if we do not design and price our products properly and competitively  our membership and profitability could decline 
we are in a highly competitive industry 
many of our competitors are more established in the health care industry and have a larger market share and greater financial resources than we do in some markets 
in addition  other companies may enter our markets in the future 
contracts for the sale of commercial products are generally bid upon or renewed annually 
while health plans compete on the basis of many factors  including service and the quality and depth of provider networks  we expect that price will continue to be a significant basis of competition 
in addition to the challenge of controlling health care costs  we face competitive pressure to contain premium prices 
premium increases  introduction of new product designs  and our relationship with our providers in various markets  among others  could affect our membership levels 
other actions that could affect membership levels include the possible exit of medicare choice service and the exit of commercial products in some markets 
if we do not compete effectively in our markets  if membership does not increase as we expect  or if it declines  or if we lose accounts with favorable medical cost experience while retaining accounts with unfavorable medical cost experience  our business and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
if we fail to manage prescription drug costs successfully  our financial results could suffer 
in general  prescription drug costs have been rising over the past few years 
these increases are due to the introduction of new drugs costing significantly more than existing drugs  direct consumer advertising by the pharmaceutical industry that creates consumer demand for particular brand name drugs  and members seeking medications to address lifestyle changes 
in order to control prescription drug costs  we have implemented multi tiered copayment benefit designs for prescription drugs  including our four tiered copayment benefit design  rx we are also evaluating other multi tiered designs 
we cannot assure that these efforts will be successful in controlling costs 
failure to control these costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we are involved in various legal actions  which  if resolved unfavorably to us  could result in substantial monetary damages 
we are a party to a variety of legal actions that affect our business  including employment and employment discrimination related suits  employee benefit claims  breach of contract actions  tort claims and shareholder suits involving alleged securities fraud 
we and some of our competitors in the health benefits business are defendants in a number of purported class action lawsuits 
these include separate suits against us and five of our competitors that purport to be brought on behalf of members of managed care plans  which we refer to as the subscriber track cases 
in addition  there is a single action against us and eight of our competitors that purports to be brought on behalf of health care providers  which we refer to as the provider track case 
these suits allege breaches of federal statutes  including erisa and rico 
in addition  because of the nature of the health care business  we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations  including the design  management and offering of products and services 
these include and could include in the future claims relating to the denial of health care benefits  challenges to the use of some software products used in administering claims  medical malpractice actions  allegations of anti competitive and unfair business activities  
table of contents provider disputes over compensation and termination of provider contracts  disputes related to self funded business  including actions alleging claim administration errors  claims related to the failure to disclose some business practices  and claims relating to customer audits and contract performance 
in some cases  substantial non economic or punitive damages as well as treble damages under the federal false claims act  rico and other statutes may be sought 
while we currently have insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities  other potential liabilities may not be covered by insurance  insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded 
in addition  some types of damages  like punitive damages  may not be covered by insurance  particularly in those jurisdictions in which coverage of punitive damages is prohibited 
insurance coverage for all or some forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future 
a description of material legal actions in which we are currently involved is included under legal proceedings of item in part i 
we cannot predict the outcome of these suits with certainty  and we are incurring expenses in the defense of these matters 
in addition  recent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims 
therefore  these legal actions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a government contractor  we are exposed to additional risks that could adversely affect our business or our willingness to participate in government health care programs 
a significant portion of our revenues relates to federal  state and local government health care coverage programs  including the medicare choice  medicaid and tricare programs 
these programs involve various risks  including the possibility of reduced or insufficient government reimbursement in the future  the possibility that we will not be able to extend or renew any of the contracts relating to these programs 
these contracts also are generally subject to frequent change  including changes that may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible to enroll  reduce the revenue we receive or increase our administrative or health care costs under those programs 
we currently are in negotiations with the department of defense to extend our tricare contracts that expire on april  for regions and and june  for regions and we believe we will be able to successfully extend our tricare contracts under substantially the same terms for one additional year plus a one year renewal option which should continue our contracts through the new tricare next generation  or t nex 
in the event government reimbursement were to decline from projected amounts  our failure to reduce the health care costs associated with these programs could have a material adverse effect on our business 
changes to these government programs in the future may also affect our ability or willingness to participate in these programs 
the loss of these contracts or significant changes in these programs as a result of legislative action  including reductions in payments or increases in benefits without corresponding increases in payments  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  at december   under one of our cms contracts  we provided health insurance coverage to approximately  members in florida 
this contract accounted for approximately of our total premiums and aso fees for the year ended december  the termination of this contract would likely have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  higher comparative medical costs  
table of contents government regulatory and reporting requirements  higher marketing and advertising costs per member as a result of marketing to individuals as opposed to groups  the possibility of temporary or permanent suspension from participating in government health care programs  including medicare and medicaid  if we are convicted of fraud or other criminal conduct in the performance of a health care program or if there is an adverse decision against us under the federal false claims act  and state budget constraints 
increased litigation and negative publicity could increase our cost of doing business 
the managed care industry continues to receive significant negative publicity reflecting the public perception of the industry 
this publicity and perception have been accompanied by increased litigation  including some large jury awards  legislative activity  regulation and governmental review of industry practices 
these factors may adversely affect our ability to market our products or services  may require us to change our products or services  may increase the regulatory burdens under which we operate and may require us to pay large judgments or fines 
any combination of these factors could further increase our cost of doing business and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our industry is currently subject to substantial government regulation  which  along with possible increased governmental regulation or legislative reform  increases our costs of doing business and could adversely affect our profitability 
the health care industry in general  and health management organizations  or hmos  and preferred provider organizations  or ppos  in particular  are subject to substantial federal and state government regulation  including regulation relating to minimum net worth  licensing requirements  approval of policy language and benefits  mandated benefits and processes  provider compensation arrangements  member disclosure  premium rates  and periodic examinations by state and federal agencies 
state regulations require our licensed  operating subsidiaries to maintain minimum net worth requirements and restrict some investment activities 
additionally  those regulations restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make dividend payments  loans  loan repayments or other payments to us 
in recent years  significant federal and state legislation affecting our business has been enacted 
state and federal governmental authorities are continually considering changes to laws and regulations applicable to us and are currently considering regulations relating to mandatory benefits and products  including a medicare pharmacy benefit or discount card  rules tightening time periods in which claims must be paid  patients bill of rights  
table of contents defining medical necessity  health insurance access  provider compensation and contract language  disclosure of provider fee schedules and other data impacting payments to providers  health plan liability to members who fail to receive appropriate care  disclosure and composition of physician networks  physicians ability to collectively negotiate contract terms with carriers  including fees  and mental health parity 
all of these proposals could apply to us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain or maintain required governmental approvals or licenses or that legislative or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain required approvals  or moratoria imposed by regulatory authorities  could adversely affect our revenue or the number of our members  increase costs or adversely affect our ability to bring new products to market as forecasted 
the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  has adopted risk based capital requirements  also known as rbc  which is subject to state by state adoption and to the extent implemented  sets minimum capitalization requirements for insurance and hmo companies 
the naic recommendations for life insurance companies were adopted in all states and the prescribed calculation for hmos has been adopted in most states in which we operate 
the hmo rules may increase the minimum capital required for some of our subsidiaries 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  includes administrative provisions directed at simplifying electronic data interchange through standardizing transactions  establishing uniform health care provider  payer and employer identifiers and seeking protections for confidentiality and security of patient data 
under the new hipaa standard transactions and code sets rules  we must make significant systems enhancements and invest in new technological solutions 
the compliance date for standard transactions and code sets rules has been extended to october  based on our submission of a compliance plan  including work plan and implementation strategy to the secretary of health and human services 
under the new hipaa privacy rules  by april  we must comply with a variety of requirements concerning the use and disclosure of individuals protected health information  establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and enter into business associate contracts with those companies to whom protected health information is disclosed 
regulations issued in february set standards for the security of electronic health information requiring compliance by april  violations of these rules will subject us to significant penalties 
compliance with hipaa regulations requires significant systems enhancements  training and administrative effort 
the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws  but rather preempt all inconsistent state laws unless the state law is more stringent 
hipaa could also expose us to additional liability for violations by our business associates 
another area receiving increased focus in is the time in which various laws require the payment of health care claims 
many states already have legislation in place covering payment of claims within a specific number of days 
however  due to provider groups advocating for laws or regulations establishing even stricter standards  procedures and penalties  we expect additional regulatory scrutiny and supplemental legislation with respect to claims payment practices 
the provider sponsored bills are characterized by stiff penalties for late payment  including high interest rates payable to providers and costly fines levied by state insurance departments and attorneys general 
this legislation and possible future regulation and oversight could expose our company to additional liability and penalties 

table of contents on november   the department of labor published its final regulation on claims and appeals review procedures under erisa 
the claims procedure regulation applies to all employee benefit plans governed by erisa  whether benefits are provided through insurance products or are self funded 
as a result  the new claims and appeals review regulation impacts nearly all employer and union sponsored health and disability plans  except church and government plans 
similar to legislation recently passed by many states  the new erisa claims and appeals procedures impose shorter and more detailed procedures for processing and reviewing claims and appeals 
according to the department of labor  however  its erisa claims and appeals regulation does not preempt state insurance and utilization review laws that impose different procedures or time lines  unless complying with the state law would make compliance with the new erisa regulation impossible 
unlike its state counterparts  the erisa claims and appeals rule does not provide for independent external review to decide disputed medical questions 
instead  the federal regulation will generally make it easier for claimants to avoid state mandated internal and external review processes and to file suit in federal court 
the new erisa claims and appeals rules generally became effective july  or the first day of the first plan year beginning after july   whichever is later 
in any case  health plans must comply with the new rules with respect to all claims filed on or after january  we are also subject to various governmental audits and investigations 
these can include audits and investigations by state attorneys general  centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  the office of the inspector general of health and human services  the office of personnel management  the department of justice and state departments of insurance and departments of health 
these activities could result in the loss of licensure or the right to participate in various programs  or the imposition of fines  penalties and other sanctions 
in addition  disclosure of any adverse investigation or audit results or sanctions could negatively affect our reputation in various markets and make it more difficult for us to sell our products and services 
if we fail to maintain satisfactory relationships with the providers of care to our members  our business could be adversely affected 
we contract with physicians  hospitals and other providers to deliver health care to our members 
our products encourage or require our customers to use these contracted providers 
these providers may share medical cost risk with us or have financial incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost effective manner 
in any particular market  providers could refuse to contract with us  demand higher payments  or take other actions that could result in higher health care costs for us  less desirable products for customers and members or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements 
in some markets  some providers  particularly hospitals  physician hospital organizations or multi specialty physician groups  may have significant market positions and negotiating power 
in addition  physician or practice management companies  which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency and marketing leverage  may  in some cases  compete directly with us 
if these providers refuse to contract with us  use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage  our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be adversely affected 
we currently are in negotiations with hca inc regarding our contracts in florida covering hospitals  which expire on april  although we have included estimated hospital rate increases in our commercial premium rates and in our medicare benefit designs  we are currently unable to predict the outcome of these negotiations  but believe such outcome will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in some situations  we have contracts with individual or groups of primary care physicians for an actuarially determined  fixed  per member per month fee under which physicians are paid an amount to provide all required medical services to our members ie capitation 
the inability of providers to properly manage costs under these arrangements can result in the financial instability of these providers and the termination of their relationship 
table of contents with us 
in addition  payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts can result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members 
the financial instability or failure of a primary care provider to pay other providers for services rendered could lead those other providers to demand payment from us  even though we have made our regular fixed payments to the primary provider 
there can be no assurance that providers with whom we contract will properly manage the costs of services  maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers 
any of these events could have an adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations 
our ability to obtain funds from our subsidiaries is restricted 
because we operate as a holding company  we are dependent upon dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries to fund the obligations of humana inc  the parent company 
these subsidiaries generally are regulated by state departments of insurance 
in most states  we are required to seek prior approval by these state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from these subsidiaries that exceed specified amounts  or  in some states  any amount 
we are also required by law to maintain specific proscribed minimum amounts of capital in these subsidiaries 
one tricare subsidiary under the regions and contract with the department of defense is required to maintain assets at least equivalent to its current liabilities 
in addition  we normally notify the state departments of insurance prior to making payments that do not require approval
