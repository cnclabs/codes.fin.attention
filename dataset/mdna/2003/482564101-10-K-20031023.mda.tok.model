item selected financial data the selected statement of operations  per share data and balance sheet data for each of the five years ended july  set forth below have been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the company 
the comparability of the data is affected by the company s purchases of product registrations and other assets related to rabon products in fiscal and msma products in fiscal and by the adoption of sfas in fiscal see  item  managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes to consolidated financial statements 
years ended july  amounts in thousands except per share data income statement data net sales net income net income per basic shares outstanding diluted shares outstanding cash dividends declared per share balance sheet data total assets long term obligations item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation results of operations the following table sets forth the company s net sales and certain other financial data for the three fiscal years ended july  years ended july  net sales gross profit gross profit as percent of net sales selling  general and administrative expense operating income other income expense  net income before taxes provision for income taxes net income sales revenue and gross profit vs 
net sales revenue was up in fiscal as compared with fiscal although wood treating chemical sales were down significantly due to reduced creosote sales  the company benefited from substantial sales in the newly acquired rabon product line 
a supply shortfall in the northeast united states hampered creosote sales in fiscal and sales also suffered because certain railroads  as a cost containment measure  specified petroleum and creosote blends for crosstie treatment rather than specifying creosote alone 
creosote sales improved in the last quarter of fiscal  however  and the company believes that will continue during the balance of the calendar year since several major railroads have indicated that their demand for treated crossties will be greater than in calendar penta products pricing was increased in june but net sales revenue from penta over the entire year was flat 
msma sales were also unchanged from the prior year 
gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal declined to from because the company experienced higher raw material costs and lower production volume on which to allocate fixed production costs 
the company expects that increased costs and depressed volume will affect gross margins adversely over the balance of the calendar year 
vs 
net sales revenue was down in fiscal as compared with fiscal wood treating chemical sales were significantly less due to reduced penta sales 
penta is used primarily to treat utility poles 
although penta sales experienced some improvement in the second half of fiscal  penta sales for fiscal were down as compared to fiscal because of soft demand in the utility pole market beginning late in calendar year creosote net sales were generally flat over the two year period 
a combination of factors appears to have caused net sales of msma products in the us to be down in fiscal over dry weather conditions in the southern us cotton growing states limited weed growth and the need for multiple applications of herbicides and distribution chain inventories from the prior year were greater than usual 
farmers in the us also continued to expand their use of the glyphosate herbicides that compete with msma 
gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal improved to from due in part to lower raw material costs 
in addition  fiscal cost of goods sold was reduced thousand as a result of reducing certain estimated accrued liabilities that had been established in prior years  primarily in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were thousand higher than fiscal and fiscal was thousand higher than fiscal in fiscal the company incurred depreciation expense associated with the msma plant during months in which the plant was not producing product because of a company decision to alternate the production of msma and penta 
the company also incurred increased registration expenses because of increased activity in the product reauthorization process being conducted by the epa and the addition of the rabon product line in december these increased expenses were offset by a decrease in amortization expense by approximately thousand per month because of the effect of new accounting rules 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal the company incurred its first full year of environmental regulatory expenses attributable to the msma business it purchased in october and it added a chief financial officer 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents in fiscal were essentially unchanged from the prior year  million at the end of fiscal as compared with approximately million and million at the end of fiscal and the million decline in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal was because trade receivables related to msma expanded as the company responded to the competitive environment by offering the extended payment terms characteristic of that business 
the company provided for the operating cash requirements of its msma business by borrowing million in fiscal under its working capital line of credit under a revolving loan agreement as amended from time to time  the revolving credit facility with southtrust bank southtrust 
under the company s revolving credit facility  the company may borrow up to the lesser of million or a borrowing base as defined therein 
the revolving credit facility contains various representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants applicable to kmg  including a limitation that equity investments or loans by kmg not exceed thousand and a requirement to obtain the lender s consent prior to replacing the president and chairman of the board of directors of kmg  david l 
hatcher  or any merger  reorganization or recapitalization of kmg 
in addition  the revolving credit facility requires kmg to maintain i a tangible net worth as defined therein of not less than million  ii a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to  and iii a ratio of liabilities to tangible net worth of not more than to as of september   the company had no borrowings under its revolving credit facility with southtrust and its borrowing base availability under that loan was million 
the company s purchase for million of the rabon product line was financed with a senior credit facility from southtrust that also refinanced the company s existing term loan facility with that bank 
as refinanced  the principal balance outstanding on september  under the company s term loan with southtrust was million 
the principal amount of the loan is being amortized monthly over ten years but the maturity date is december  the loan carries interest at a varying rate equal to libor plus but in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap transaction with southtrust which effectively fixed the interest rate at for the remainder of the term 
management believes that the term loan and the revolving credit facility adequately provide for the company s anticipated need for liquidity and capital resources in fiscal for the company s current operations 
the company s capital expenditures in fiscal were down significantly to only thousand and reflected a return to more normal expenditure levels 
in fiscal and the company incurred substantial capital expenditures of million and million  most of which were for purchase of msma assets or for relocation and construction of the new msma plant 
the company s capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters  excluding testing and data submission costs  were approximately thousand in fiscal and thousand and thousand in fiscal and the fiscal expenditures reflect a return to more normal expenditure levels while the higher amount in fiscal was attributable to the msma business 
the company estimates that its capital expenditures and operating expenses for environmental matters other than testing and data submission will be approximately thousand in fiscal the company expensed approximately thousand for testing and data submission costs in fiscal and approximately thousand and thousand in fiscal and the increased registration expenses was due of increased activity in the product reauthorization process being conducted by the epa and the addition of the rabon product line in december for those reasons  management believes that total testing and data submission costs will increase in fiscal to approximately million 
since environmental laws have traditionally become increasingly stringent  costs and expenses relating to environmental control and compliance may increase in the future 
while the company does not believe that the cost of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations  there can be no assurance that costs of compliance will not exceed current estimates 
the company conducts periodic ground water sampling at its facility in tuscaloosa  alabama as required by the alabama department of the environmental management adem 
a sampling revealed the presence of penta contamination and more recent sampling continues to show some contamination  although in lesser amounts 
adem has not required any additional response at this time beyond the continuation of periodic monitoring 
the company does not believe that costs for environmental investigation and remediation will materially impact liquidity or have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations  although there can be no assurances to this effect 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements

new accounting rules effective august   the company adopted a statement promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  amortization expense decreased by approximately  per month 
see note to the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
in february  sfas no 
was issued  accounting for stock based compensation a comparison of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and its related interpretations  and iasb proposed ifrs  share based payments 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based compensation 
the company has chosen not to voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation but has adopted the disclosure rules of sfas no 
the company has adopted sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has adopted sfas no 
accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement requires issuers to classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability instead of equity 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting principles that we believe are the most important to aid in fully understanding our financial results are the following revenue recognition the company essentially has only one revenue recognition transaction in which the company s chemical products sold in the open market are recognized as revenue as risk of loss and title to the products transfer to customers  which usually occurs at the time a shipment is made 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company provides an allowance for accounts receivable it believes it may not collect in full 
a provision for bad debt expense recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses increases the allowance 
accounts receivable that are written off the company s books decrease the allowance 
the amount of bad debt expense recorded each period and the resulting adequacy of the allowance at the end of each period are determined using a combination of the company s historical loss experience  customer by customer analyses of the company s accounts receivable balances each period and subjective assessments of the company s future bad debt exposure 
inventories inventories consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods that the company holds for sale in the ordinary course of business 
it uses the first in  first out method to value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
management believes the company has not incurred impairments in the carrying value of its inventories 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets held and used and assets to be disposed of  including supply contracts and other intangible assets  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of long lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment on a product line basis 
the company has concluded on the basis of its evaluation that the long lived assets are not impaired 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the ordinary course of business  primarily from changes in foreign exchange rates 
the company generally does not utilize derivative financial instruments or hedging transactions to manage that risk 
however  the company did enter into an interest rate swap transaction in february  that effectively fixed the interest rate on its term loan at for the remainder of the loan s term 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not affect the company s earnings or cash flow over the life of the term loan because the interest rate swap serves to fix the interest rate at 
should the financial market s expectations for interest rates in the future increase then the value of the swap  recorded as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets  would increase 
conversely  a drop in the financial market s expectations for future interest rates would cause a drop in the value of that recorded asset 
it is possible that the future expectations for interest rates could decline enough to cause the swap to be recorded no longer as an asset  but as a liability  until the swap expires
