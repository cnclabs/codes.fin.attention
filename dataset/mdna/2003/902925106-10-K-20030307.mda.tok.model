item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
the company s greatest resource requirements include qualified drivers  tractors  trailers and related costs of operating its equipment such as diesel fuel fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of qualified drivers and the market for new and used tractors and trailers 
because the company is completely self insured for physical damage to its tractors and trailers  with the exception that the company carries catastrophic physical damage coverage to protect the company against natural disasters  and is partially self insured for cargo loss and damage  bipd claims  and physical damage claims on its trucks and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  the weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from years to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example years for a tractor are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
estimates of accrued liabilities for liability insurance claims  physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and long term are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates  including negative development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
revenues are recognized based on a method whereby revenue is allocated between fiscal years based on relative transit time in each period and direct expenses are expensed as incurred 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain items to operating revenues  before fuel surcharge  for the years indicated year ended december  revenue  before fuel surcharge operating expenses and costs salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization purchased transportation operations and maintenance insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses communications and utilities other operating income other expenses income interest expense gain loss on disposal of assets other  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net of fuel surcharge year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues  before fuel surcharge  increased to million in from million in the company believes this increase is due primarily to an increase of in the average number of tractors operated from  including owner operators in to  including owner operators in and to a increase in pl and brokerage revenues to million in from million for and  to a lesser extent  the increase in the average revenue per mile 
direct expenses associated with pl and brokerage revenues and owner operator fees comprise purchased transportation expense 
average revenue per mile exclusive of fuel surcharge increased to in from in primarily due to the abovementioned increase in pl and brokerage revenues and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the average rate per mile charged 
the number of shipments increased to  in from  in miles per tractor per week decreased from  in to  in primarily due to an increase in the percentage of unmanned tractors from of the fleet in to of the fleet in the increase in the percentage of unmanned tractors was primarily the result of an increase in the number of company owned tractors and driver turnover exceeding the number of drivers hired 
the empty mile factor decreased to of paid miles in from of paid miles in the decreased empty mile factor was primarily the result of improved freight demand in the company s operating areas and  to a lesser extent  reduced quantities of inbound loads into areas where there are few available outbound loads 
operating expenses and costs as a percentage of revenues  before fuel surcharge  decreased to in from in the decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits costs  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was primarily the result of the company implementing a per diem pay program for its drivers during april and increases in pl and brokerage revenues and the company s owner operator fleet 
the average number of owner operators in the company s fleet increased from in to in the decrease in fuel and fuel taxes costs  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was primarily due to a decrease in fuel prices and the abovementioned increases in pl and brokerage revenues and the company s owner operator fleet 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was primarily the result of the abovementioned increases in pl and brokerage revenues and the company s owner operator fleet 
these increases were partially offset by slightly higher depreciation expense on extended lived tractors see item business revenue equipment acquisition program 
the increase in purchased transportation costs  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was primarily due to the abovementioned increases in pl and brokerage revenues and the company s owner operator fleet described above 
the decrease in operations and maintenance costs  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was primarily the result of the abovementioned increases in pl and brokerage revenues and the company s owner operator fleet and a reduction in operations and maintenance costs per company owned tractor 
the reduction in operations and maintenance costs per company owned tractor is due to the company performing a greater percentage of maintenance work at its terminal facilities and implementing more cost effective methods for purchasing tires and equipment parts 
the increase in insurance and claims costs  as a percentage of revenue  before of fuel surcharge  was primarily due to a increase in liability  cargo and workers compensation insurance premiums in compared to and  to a lesser extent  a increase in adverse claims accruals for compared to these increases were partially offset by the abovementioned increases in pl and brokerage revenues and the company s owner operator fleet 
as a result of the foregoing factors  operating income increased to million  or of revenue  before fuel surcharge  in from million  or of revenue  before fuel surcharge  in interest expense decreased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from interest rate decreases on the company s senior credit facility as defined under liquidity and capital resources herein and  to a lesser extent  from a decrease in average borrowings under the company s senior credit facility described under the liquidity and capital resources section herein

the principal means of competition in the truckload segment of the industry are service and rates  with rate discounting being particularly intense during economic downturns in order to maintain desired revenue levels 
although the company competes primarily on the basis of its service provided to its customers rather than rates charged  rate discounting continues to be a factor in obtaining and retaining business 
the number of firms competing in the truckload segment of the industry has increased dramatically since the deregulation of the industry in also  a depressed economy tends to increase the competitive pressure placed on rate and service from alternative modes of transportation such as less than truckload and railroads 
the company s management believes that the truckload segment of the market has reached a certain level of maturity as the market exists currently and that the company s further growth in the truckload segment of the industry is likely to be attained by increasing its market share rather than through an increase in the overall size of the market 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating revenues  before fuel surcharge  increased to million in from million in the company believes this increase is due primarily to the reduction in unmanned tractors  additional business from existing customers and  to a lesser extent  the marketing efforts by the company s logistics division 
all expenses associated with pl and brokerage revenues and owner operator fees comprise purchased transportation expense 
average revenue per mile exclusive of fuel surcharge increased to in from in primarily due to an increase in brokerage and pl revenue

in this increase was partially offset by a decrease in salaries  wages and employee benefits  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  other than driver wages 
the decrease in fuel and fuel taxes costs  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was primarily the result of a decrease in fuel cost resulting from a 
decrease in the average price per gallon in from and an improvement in fuel efficiency to miles per gallon in from miles per gallon in fuel efficiency is affected by several factors including tractor idle time management  driver quality  engine technology and weather conditions in north america 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expense  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  resulted from a increase in tractor utilization from to  as mentioned above  and a increase in revenue per mile partially offset by slightly higher depreciation rates on certain groups of equipment 
the increase in purchased transportation costs  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  was primarily due to the abovementioned increases in brokerage and pl revenue described above 
the decrease in insurance and claims costs  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  resulted from a decrease in the number of accidents from  in to  in despite a increase in fleet miles 
the decrease in other expenses  as a percentage of revenue  before fuel surcharge  resulted primarily from reduced recruiting and training costs brought about by a lower driver turnover rate and a more competitive driver compensation program 
as a result of the foregoing factors  operating income increased to million  or of revenue  before fuel surcharge  in from million or  of revenues  before fuel surcharge  in interest expense decreased to million in from million in  resulting primarily from significantly lower outstanding debt balances and lower interest rates

inflation the effect of inflation on revenue and operating costs has been minimal in recent years 
most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with increases in inflation generally resulting in increased operating costs and expenses 
the effect of inflation driven cost increases on the company s overall operating costs would not be expected to be greater for the company than for its competitors 
seasonality in the trucking industry generally  revenues decrease as customers reduce shipments during the winter holiday season and as inclement weather impedes operations 
at the same time  operating expenses increase  due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs 
future revenues could be impacted if customers reduce shipments due to temporary plant closings  which historically have occurred during july and december 
fuel availability and cost the motor carrier industry is dependent upon the availability of fuel  and fuel shortages or increases in fuel taxes or fuel costs have adversely affected  and may in the future adversely affect the profitability of usa truck  inc fuel prices have fluctuated widely and fuel taxes have generally increased in recent years 
the company has not experienced difficulty in maintaining necessary fuel supplies  and in the past the company generally has been able to recover most of the increases in fuel costs and fuel taxes from customers through increased freight rates 
overall  the company experienced lower fuel prices in  however  fuel prices increased throughout the year 
there also can be no assurance that the company will be able to recover any future increases in fuel costs and fuel taxes through increased rates
