technologies  products and services vcr plus our first proprietary system  the vcr plus system for selecting television programming for recording  was introduced in since then  our vcr plus technology has been adopted as the industry standard for vcr recording of television programming by virtually every major consumer electronics manufacturer worldwide 
vcr plus is offered internationally in more than countries 
it is incorporated into vcrs and televisions by licensed consumer electronics manufacturers and enables consumers to record a television program by simply entering a proprietary one to eight digit pluscode number  via a remote control unit  into a vcr or television set 
pluscode numbers are printed next to television listings in participating newspapers and television program guides 
pluscode numbers are generated through a patented process developed by the company and are now carried by over  publications worldwide  with a combined circulation of over million  including the new york times  the los angeles times  tv guide  the asahi shimbun japan  the sun uk  the daily mirror uk and the guangdong dianshi zhoubao china 
in north america  we pay an agency to manage  collect and remit payments from owners of newspapers and magazines that publish our pluscodes  we also sell our pluscodes to a data company that bundles the codes with other data sold to owners of newspapers and magazines 
in europe  australia  new zealand and asia other than taiwan  japan and south korea  our subsidiaries directly handle our pluscode publication contracts and manage and collect the fees under those contracts 
our infomedia subsidiary also collects  processes and distributes television listings data for more than countries in europe

upon the closing of our initial public offering  the stock of these entities was spun off to entities that were controlled by former stockholders and executives of our predecessor company 
the current ownership of these entities is unknown 
also upon the closing of our initial public offering  these entities entered into service contracts with the company for pluscode publication that have since expired  although the company has continued to fund their operations to enable performance under the expired service contracts 
in june  gemstar japan transferred certain trademark registrations back to the company 
the company is currently exploring whether to renew the service contracts with these entities  or to pursue other forms of distribution for our pluscodes in japan  south korea and taiwan 
we continue to develop and introduce additional features based on the vcr plus technology that manufacturers can license from the company to enhance the functionality of the vcr plus system 
these features include functions that are capable of automating the vcr plus setup procedures  controlling set top boxes and updating the clock and cable channel lineup information 
the vcr plus system and all its attendant enhancement functions are also licensed for incorporation into digital devices such as hard disk recorders and dvd recorders 
interactive program guides our ipgs allow television viewers to retrieve program listings and content information on demand and to perform various interactive functions designed to enhance the television viewing experience 
we believe that interactive television guidance technology is quickly becoming a must have tool for television viewers bombarded with an increasing number of programming choices  an increasing number of digital cable and satellite television channels  and video on demand and subscription video on demand 
we also believe that our ipgs will become an entry point for consumers to avail themselves of a range of new services and content that will be available on television screens

other functions offered by our ipgs include parental control features  reminder notices to viewers  programming features for recording and pay per view and video on demand integration 
in addition  some of our ipgs allow viewers to record television programming for later viewing 
as of december  the company had deployed over million guide plus ipgs  which are incorporated into consumer electronics devices  and over million tv guide interactive ipgs  which are incorporated into digital cable set top boxes 
in addition  the company s ipg technologies have been incorporated into tuner cards for use in pcs 
we currently market and license our ipg technology  ipg products and ipg services to consumer electronics manufacturers and to service providers and manufacturers that supply service providers with cable and satellite set top boxes 
in the consumer electronics business  our ipg technology enables licensed manufacturers to enhance the functionality and appeal of their products and to realize additional revenue through premium pricing 
in the service provider business  our ipg technology enables service providers to deliver advertising and market additional services and content to subscribers 
our ipg technology allows service providers to customize certain elements of our ipgs for their subscribers and also allows them to upgrade over time the features and services they can offer to their subscribers 
our ipgs are compatible with service providers subscription management and pay per view operations 
ipgs also allow programmers and programming distributors to continuously disseminate updated program information 
our ipg technology  ipg products and or ipg services have been licensed to significant consumer electronics manufacturers and msos 
we recently announced a multi year licensing agreement with consumer electronics manufacturer royal philips electronics philips to incorporate our new tv guide on screen ipg into dvd recorders and television sets  and to use other electronic program guides in dbs set top boxes 
this agreement does not have minimum aggregate licensing fee or volume commitments 
we currently have contracts with cable system operators and telephone companies in the united states that license our ipg products and services for distribution to their subscribers in television sets and set top boxes 
in the computer and internet business  we have licensed our ipg technology to a leading software company  which has adopted our ipg technology in a number of its product offerings 
our ipg technology  ipg products and ipg services have also been licensed by one of the largest tuner card manufacturers in the united states and incorporated into tuner cards for use in pcs 
electronic book publishing in early  we entered the ebook business with the acquisition of softbook press  inc softbook and nuvomedia  inc 
nuvomedia  two pioneering companies in the ebook business  and later  les editions h  an electronic publisher in europe our european ebook operations are being discontinued 
we earn revenues in our ebook business through licensing technology and selling e book devices and content 
at this time  the company s ebook business is still in a development stage  and the company is evaluating strategic alternatives for the business  including a joint venture with one or more financial or strategic investors or divestiture 
interactive platform services our data service used in conjunction with our ipg products continually updates the data that appears on these products 
that data includes the most currently available program listings and advertising data  which we regularly accumulate from our shared listings databases  and specialized advertising systems for distribution to our ipg products and licensees 
we use both our internal data operations and external commercial suppliers to obtain program listings data 
advertising data is accumulated and entered into specialized advertising systems as specified by our advertising customers 
we process and format the program listings and advertising data into proprietary data formats and deliver it via a variety of transmission means  including land line telephone link  broadcast signals and satellite feed 
generally  to populate consumer electronics appliances  the data is fed to our insertion equipment located in network headends  cable headends and broadcast stations for inclusion in the vertical blanking interval vbi of television signals 
norpak corporation  a majority owned canadian subsidiary of the company  manufactures and supplies us with the vbi insertion equipment 
we have arrangements for carriage of our data in the vbi of television stations included in the public broadcasting network  independently owned stations  and stations owned and operated by various station group owners 
in exchange for the right to transmit our data in a station s vbi  we generally provide the station with a preferred position on the ipg in its designated market area 
to populate cable set top boxes  the data is continuously delivered to local affiliate cable systems for delivery to set top boxes in subscribers homes via out of band data frequencies 
we began efforts to sell advertising on our ipg platforms in our ipg advertisers today include some of the most recognized names in american product and service marketing and some significant programmers and entertainment distributors 
since the ipg is a new and unique advertising medium  advertising sales volume is still relatively small 
the majority of advertising on our ipgs is advertising from third parties with which we have other business relationships 
in many cases  these relationships require us to make payments to the advertiser in the form of market development or similar funds related to our ipgs  or to provide economic incentives to such advertisers through the use of advertising inventory on other company advertising platforms 
we account for such transactions as multiple element arrangements see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  substantially all of the revenues from these advertisers are recognized in other sectors 
we expect to continue to account for ipg advertising associated with multiple element arrangements in this manner until such time as we conclude that we can determine the fair value of ipg advertising in a reliable  verifiable and objective manner 
at this time  in all instances in which ipg advertising is part of a multiple element transaction  no revenue is allocated to ipg advertising or the interactive platform sector for accounting purposes  and all revenue is allocated to other elements of the transaction and other sectors 
see note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  to consolidated financial statements 
the company is currently reviewing its commitment to ipg advertising as part of its re evaluation of its ipg business strategy 
the company also conducts electronic commerce on its www 
skymall 
com and www 
tvguide 
com web sites 
at this time  our electronic commerce activities are still in a development stage 
tv guide magazine tv guide magazine has been published continuously since and is the most widely circulated paid weekly magazine in the united states 
tv guide magazine offers television viewers both television program listings and descriptions and editorial content  including feature articles covering programming  entertainers and the entertainment industry 
we expect the program listing aspect of tv guide magazine to decrease in value as the number of channels and programming choices increases and alternative means of obtaining program schedule information continue to proliferate including ipgs and online services 
on the other hand  we expect the editorial aspect of tv guide magazine to increase in value as the need for guidance and recommendations on what to watch increases because of the increase in programming choices due to digital technologies 
the company plans to follow a strategy based on these predictions by building tv guide magazine into a valued planning tool to guide program choices and complement the other guidance tools that the company deploys  all under one trusted brand tv guide 
as of december   tv guide magazine had a circulation of over million copies that reached approximately million readers each week  according to mediamark research  inc we publish over separate digest and ultimate size editions of this magazine weekly  including geographic and cable specific editions 
on a monthly basis  we also publish the cable guide  which has approximately  subscribers 
in addition  our custom publishing unit produces a monthly pay per view guide for more than cable systems in the united states 
tv guide magazine attracts new subscribers to its cable specific editions through the continued customization of the magazine for regional cable systems and through customer marketing programs in conjunction with the country s largest msos 
tv guide magazine s rate base  the volume of circulation guaranteed to advertisers  as of december  was unchanged from million as of december  the magazine s rate base was last adjusted from million in june to million 
tv guide magazine fully complies with the audit bureau of circulations audit requirements 
tv guide magazine s circulation is comprised of a number of sources  including newsstand sales  individually paid subscriptions and subscriptions sold in bulk 
bulk sold subscriptions increased from million copies at december  to million copies at december  bulk sold subscriptions produce little or no circulation contribution and are of substantially lesser economic value than other sources of circulation 
tv guide magazine revenues have accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for each of the last three fiscal years 
in the nine months and year ended december   and in the years ended december  and december   tv guide magazine s revenues accounted for   and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues for such years 
tv guide magazine s circulation revenues are derived from four primary sources new subscriptions through insert cards in tv guide magazine  direct mail and direct mail agents  subscription renewals  single copy newsstand sales  and subscriptions and subscription renewals for cable and satellite specific editions 
tv guide magazine circulation revenues decreased in and due to declines in the number of new subscribers  lower renewal rates and reduced newsstand sales 
the decrease in circulation revenues due to declines in the number of new tv guide magazine subscribers  however  has been partially offset by an increase in the number of subscribers to cable and satellite specific editions of the magazine 
the overall decrease in circulation revenues of tv guide magazine may continue and could be significant 
in the year ended december   tv guide magazine carried more than  total advertising pages 
the national feature section  which has traditionally attracted general appeal category advertisers such as food  drug  automobile  entertainment and packaged goods companies  comprised approximately of these pages 
network and cable tune in advertising  traditionally included in the listings section  comprised of total advertising pages  and insert advertising represented approximately of these pages 
tv guide magazine sells advertising principally through an internal advertising sales force  tv guide media sales 
advertisers may purchase pages on either a national or regional basis in tv guide according to their needs 
the printing of tv guide magazine and the other publications published by the tv guide magazine group is outsourced to seven independent commercial printers located throughout the united states 
we believe that there is an adequate supply of alternative printing services available to publish tv guide magazine at competitive prices should the need arise 
the principal raw materials used in the publication of tv guide magazine are coated and uncoated paper 
paper prices are affected by a variety of factors  including demand  capacity  pulp supply and general economic conditions 
material changes in the price of coated and uncoated paper could have a material adverse effect on tv guide magazine s operating performance 
the company does not hedge against increases in paper costs 
postage for product distribution and direct mail solicitations is also a significant expense to tv guide magazine and a material increase in postage prices could affect the magazine s operating performance 
prior to  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company provided newsstand distribution for tv guide magazine and magazines published by unaffiliated parties 
in  we shut down this distribution company and effectively exited the distribution business 
the decision to exit the business was driven by the general level of consolidation in the magazine distribution industry  which made it economically impractical for tv guide magazine to maintain its own distribution operation 
our former distribution business was responsible for billing and collections for all non affiliated publishers  a practice that increased our accounts receivable collection risk 
the shutdown was achieved by contracting with an outside company for distribution of tv guide magazine and assigning existing contracts with unaffiliated publishers to that company 
tv guide channel the tv guide channel offers multichannel video providers a fully customized and localized television network  continuously delivering updated entertainment information that promotes the provider s networks and programs 
tv guide channel s hosted format is designed to appeal to cable operators  advertisers and consumers 
tv guide channel generated a prime time total household nielsen rating of during the fourth quarter of  exceeding nielsen ratings received by other well known information networks such as cnbc  msnbc  the weather channel  and vh tv guide channel is typically included in a basic or expanded basic viewing package offered by programming distributors to their subscribers  and is available in both analog and digital form 
subscribers do not need additional equipment converters or sidecars to receive the channel 
the screen for tv guide channel is divided into two components  with the upper half devoted to programming that drives the cable operator s primary revenue generators  such as pay per view or video on demand  creates an entertainment environment in which media buyers want to place their clients advertising and gives consumers up to the minute  customized entertainment information on every aspect of upcoming programs 
this portion of the screen combines behind the scenes footage  in depth interviews and localized information with reviews  recommendations and previews related to upcoming programming options 
the lower half of the screen displays listings that contain viewing times  channel numbers  network identification  program titles  weather  movie descriptions  program ratings and ordering instructions for pay per view services  updated in  cable tv distribution headends around the country on a daily basis 
we seek to establish the tv guide channel as the premier source for programming guidance in video form 
tvg network we own of tvg network 
we produce  market and distribute tvg network  a cable and satellite sports entertainment television network that combines live horseracing from many of the premier horse racetracks in the united states with the convenience of interactive wagering from home 
tvg network has entered into exclusive and non exclusive agreements with horse racetracks to deliver racing content to and accept wagers from subscribers in return for a fee based on a percentage of gross wagering handled by tvg network and transaction fees 
as of december   tvg network s television network is available in more than million us households on echostar satellite corporation s dish network dish network satellite service basic tier  c band satellite systems and on cable systems in regional areas 
in certain states  tvg network customers may establish wagering accounts to wager on the horse races through patented  proprietary interactive applications utilizing automated telephone  online virtual private network and digital set top box remote control software developed or in development by the company 
in early  tvg network began to offer wagering services to residents of california  the most substantial revenue producing opportunity for the business to date 
with the development of television distribution in california and other major racing markets and the expansion of markets from which accounts are accepted  we believe that increased fee revenue  network advertising  merchandising and data delivery  home shopping  e commerce and interactive advertising opportunities may become available 
tvg network is a development stage business in which the company has made substantial investment 
growth in the business will depend on the legislative and regulatory environment on both federal and state levels  the continued expansion of cable and satellite television distribution and the integration of interactive wagering technologies for online and interactive television applications

superstar netlink direct to home satellite programming services we own approximately of superstar netlink 
superstar netlink markets and distributes entertainment programming to c band home satellite dish owners in the united states in subscription periods of one  three  six and twelve months 
the c band business is declining primarily as a result of competition from dbs and cable television systems 
dbs providers such as dish network and directv transmit on the ku band  which uses a higher power signal than c band satellites  enabling dbs customers to use smaller  less obtrusive satellite dishes 
in addition  dbs and digital cable operators transmit digital signals that allow for a larger number of channels  including local network stations  with better audio and video quality than analog systems 
to further its strategy of reducing operational involvement in this business while maximizing profitability  in  superstar netlink entered into a marketing alliance agreement to promote and solicit orders for dish network 
in exchange  superstar netlink receives an initial commission for each superstar netlink subscriber who subscribes to dish network and a monthly residual commission over the life of the agreement  which expires at the end of during the year ended december   the number of c band subscribers decreased by to approximately  subscribers 
at december   superstar netlink provided service to  of these subscribers  a decrease of from the subscribers served by superstar netlink at december  we expect the decline in our c band business to continue and this decline may be accelerated by our agreement with dish network 
uvtv satellite distribution of video entertainment services through our uvtv subsidiary  we market and distribute television superstations wpix new york and ktla los angeles to cable systems and direct to home subscribers  including c band and dbs 
in addition  we market and distribute the denver television stations 
during  we ceased to operate a separate business that sold programming packages to satellite master antenna television systems serving hotels and multi unit dwellings 
spacecom satellite transmission services for private networks our spacecom subsidiary provides point to multipoint and commercial point to point two way broadband satellite communications for various industries throughout north and south america  including radio programmers  paging network operators  financial information providers  news services  internet service providers and other private business networks 
spacecom leases two ku band satellite transponders and several portions of other ku and c band transponders  communications on which originate from its teleport facility 
we believe that this business is non core to our overall business strategy and are evaluating strategic alternatives for this business  including divestiture 
intellectual property rights and proprietary information we operate in an industry in which innovation  investment in new ideas and protection of our intellectual property rights are important for success 
the company protects its innovations and inventions via a variety of means  including but not limited to applying for patent protection internationally and domestically 
we believe we have one of the world s most extensive portfolios of intellectual property in the area of interactive program guides  which broadly covers fundamental advances related to interactive program guide information delivery  storage  retrieval  advertising  two way interaction  electronic commerce  and related user interfaces  including those relevant to online and interactive television services 
our technology and intellectual properties have been licensed to significant consumer electronics manufacturers and msos 
we currently market ipgs under brands that include guide plus and tv guide interactive  and have entered into an agreement to market our tv guide on screen ipg in consumer electronics devices manufactured by philips 
the company currently has over issued us patents in the general area of audio visual technologies with more than  claims  and over issued foreign patents 
each of the company s issued patents will expire at a different time based on the particular filing date or issue date of that respective patent  with expiration dates as late as the company continues to actively pursue a worldwide intellectual property program and currently has approximately us and  foreign patent applications pending

competition the company s technologies  products and services compete with those of other companies 
many of the company s present and potential future competitors have  or may have  substantially greater resources than the company to devote to further technological and new product developments 
the company believes that it will compete effectively based primarily on the originality of its concepts  the speed with which it can introduce such concepts to the market  the uniqueness of its designs  the focus of its business approach  the strength of its intellectual property portfolio  the extensiveness of its business relationships  the quality and innovation of its technologies and its ability to identify and meet consumer needs 
vcr plus system the company is not aware of any product other than the vcr plus system that allows the user to program a vcr by entering a numerical code 
however  several products on the market offer other simplified vcr programming functions and thus compete with the vcr plus system 
such products include on screen program guides incorporating point and click recording capability 
in addition  some new products permit consumers to record programs directly from air or cable for later viewing through the use of memory chips and hard disk drives contained in the devices 
worldwide shipments of vcrs decreased in and are expected to continue to decrease in future years due to the introduction of these new digital recording devices 
the vcr plus system is beginning to be incorporated into some of these digital recording devices  notably hard disk recorders and dvd recorders 
however  to the extent that electronic program guides with recording capability offered by companies other than the company are widely adopted  such guides may reduce the need for vcr plus 
all electronic program guides  including those that do not have a point and click recording feature  may compete with the printed television guides  and may adversely affect the company s pluscode number coverage and publication license income 
interactive program guides competition in the market for the delivery of television program schedule information is intense 
there are a number of companies that produce and market television schedule information in various formats and that compete or will compete with the company s ipg products and services 
these alternative formats currently include traditional printed television guides including our own tv guide magazine and other printed cable guides  as well as passive and interactive on screen electronic guide services  printed television guides in newspapers and weekly publications  and local cable television guides  many of which are similar to other products of the company 
improvements in software porting and in software substitutability  together with government mandated introduction of so called open cable platforms  will increasingly permit the creation of new guides and their quick placement in set top boxes both those purchased from service providers and those purchased at retail 
we intend to modify and improve our technology to be competitive on these new platforms 
many of the company s competitors and other companies and individuals have obtained  and may be expected to obtain in the future  patents that may directly or indirectly affect the products or services offered or under development by the company 
the company is currently developing a variety of enhancements to its ipgs 
we cannot assure you that any enhancements developed by the company would not be found to infringe patents that are currently held or may be issued to others 
patents of third parties may have an important bearing on the company s ability to offer certain of its products and services 
there can be no assurance that the company is or will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by the company s products and services 
in addition  patent applications in the united states are generally confidential until a patent is issued  so the company cannot evaluate the extent to which certain products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications 
in general  if one or more of the company s products or services were to infringe patents held by others  the company may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services  to obtain licenses to develop and market the services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims 
the company cannot assess the extent to which it may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others  whether such licenses would be available or  if available  whether the company would be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
if the company were unable to obtain such licenses  the company may not be able to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
although the company believes that its ipgs are in a strong competitive position with respect to its known competitors  there may be competitors with additional strengths that are unknown to the company 
such potential competitors  which may include hardware manufacturers  software developers  broadcasters or service providers  could be larger  more established companies with greater resources in the program information delivery market 
electronic book publishing the market for ebooks is developing 
however  a number of companies of significant size and strength such as microsoft  hewlett packard and palm have introduced products to compete in the field 
in addition  the company faces competition from the distribution of electronic content over the internet 
tv guide magazine and tv guide channel tv guide magazine and tv guide channel have the following primary sources of competition television listings included in local and national newspapers  as well as free supplements in sunday newspapers  niche cable guide publications  general entertainment and other magazines and television programming focused on television stars and programs  other electronic  interactive and online programming guides  and the company s own interactive and internet program listings guide services 
in addition  tv guide channel competes with other programming for limited analog cable television system channel slots 
this competition has increased  and the company believes will continue to increase  as programming distributors recapture analog channels to launch digital services 
to date  the impact of channel recapture has not been significant to tv guide channel 
in addition  the tv guide channel also faces competition from cable television operators  which may wish to launch their own programming guide channels  and from zapit  a unit of tribune media 
superstar netlink the c band direct to home satellite industry is declining primarily as a result of competition from dbs and cable television systems 
dbs providers such as dish network and directv transmit on the ku band  which uses a higher power signal than c band satellites  enabling dbs customers to use smaller  less obtrusive satellite dishes 
in addition  dbs and digital cable operators transmit digital signals that allow for a larger number of channels  including local network stations  with better audio and video quality than analog systems  and subscribers of c band programming are encountering reduced availability of programming as the number of channels broadcast as analog signals capable of being received and descrambled by a typical c band satellite dish decreases 
research and development the market for the company s products and services is subject to rapid and significant changes in technology and frequent new service and product introductions 
the company believes that one of the keys to its future success will be its ability to enhance its existing technologies and to introduce products and services using such new technologies on a competitive basis 
accordingly  the company will continue to engage in significant research and development activities 
the company s expenditures for research and development for the year ended december   the year ended december  and the nine months ended december  were million  million and million  respectively 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will successfully complete the development of any future technology or that such technology will be compatible with  accepted by or incorporated in the products and services of the company or in products of third parties 
any significant delay or failure to develop new or enhanced technology could have a material adverse effect on the company 
regulation the satellite transmission  cable and telecommunications industries are subject to federal regulatory conditions  including federal communications commission fcc licensing and other requirements 
the industries are also often subject to extensive regulation by local and state authorities 
although most cable and telecommunication industry regulations do not apply directly to the company  they affect programming distributors  a primary customer for the company s products and services 
the company monitors pending legislation and administrative proceedings to ascertain relevance  analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments within the industry 
satellite home viewer improvement act of the satellite home viewer improvement act of shvia was signed into law november   as part of an appropriations bill 
shvia applies new rules  exemptions and added regulatory requirements to the c band and dbs industry generally  the combined effect of which restricts and may ultimately make uneconomic the up linking and distribution of distant network stations and superstations to dish owners by uvtv 
in addition  although superstar netlink is not a satellite carrier  certain programming sold by superstar netlink  such as denver  is subject to these rules 
uvtv s denver  wpix and ktla services  as satellite carriers  are subject to the new provisions and rules adopted under shvia 
local into local shvia provides satellite carriers a new compulsory copyright license  which is permanent and royalty free  for the delivery of local network stations into local markets defined as the station s designated market area  or dma  and county of license 
the company has no plans to distribute local signals in the c band markets 
dbs carriers have announced plans to serve all television markets with local stations 
the distribution of local signals will enhance direct broadcast carriers ability to compete with cable and may enhance  subject to the limitations above  the distribution of superstations and distant network stations to dbs subscribers 
the availability of local signals to dbs  without corresponding local signals for c band  may contribute to the ongoing decline of c band subscribers 
interactive television matters on january   the fcc issued a notice of inquiry noi concerning interactive television interactive tv 
the noi is still pending before the fcc and no final action has been taken 
the noi raised a series of questions that suggest that cable systems might be regarded as essential  open platforms of spectrum for non discriminatory third party access  rather than facilities based providers competing in a wider market 
interactive tv is a service so new that the fcc had difficulty defining it  but the fcc stated in the noi that it considered interactive tv to embrace at least electronic program guides  interactive video content  and supplementary signals that wrap around video and provide additional content or services 
the noi sought comments on the nature of interactive tv eg  what is it  who will provide it  how will it be provided  what are the business models for its provision  and whether cable systems will be a superior platform for the provision of interactive tv 
although positioned as a notice of inquiry which cannot lead directly to the adoption of rules  the noi asked very detailed questions many of which arise from a common regulatory premise that cable operators who are affiliated with interactive tv providers should not be permitted to discriminate in favor of their own interactive tv services with respect to spectrum usage  and that interactive tv providers affiliated with cable operators may need to be subjected to non discrimination rules so that they may not obtain leverage from any exclusive arrangement they would otherwise negotiate with popular programmers 
the outcome of the noi will determine whether or not a subsequent rulemaking will be held in order to create regulations for the interactive television industry 
any regulation of this industry could have a direct impact on tv guide interactive as well as tvg network  but at this time  it is too speculative to determine what those rules or their impact may be 
vbi and digital data carriage matters the company uses the vbi  or vertical blanking interval  in the analog television signals of the local affiliates of major broadcast networks such as pbs through national datacast  abc  cbs  nbc  fox and national cable stations to supply updates throughout the day of program listing information to its guide plus branded consumer electronics devices in the united states 
on december   time warner cable  a division of aol time warner  obtained a ruling from the fcc that it is within the discretion of a cable mso to retransmit or strip out data transmitted in the vbi lines of broadcast stations carried on that mso s system 
on january   the company filed a petition for reconsideration of this ruling  supported by parties including the consumer electronics association  the association for maximum service television  inc  national datacast  the media access project  the center for digital democracy  consumers union  consumer federation of america and the united church of christ  office of communication  inc notwithstanding the foregoing  the company has commercial arrangements with many of the largest cable msos to provide for carriage of the company s data 
at this time  it is too early to assess what the economic impact  if any  of a denial by the fcc of the company s reconsideration petition would be on the company s guide plus interactive program guide service 
in the digital television context  the local affiliates of major broadcast networks and national cable stations plan to carry guide plus updating information in their digital broadcast signals 
in january  the fcc suggested that in many instances  electronic program guide enabling data in the digital context would not be considered program related and therefore cable systems would not be required to pass through to subscribers such data when transmitted as part of the digital signals of broadcast stations carried on those systems 
the company has asked the fcc to reconsider this decision  and the fcc is currently evaluating how ultimately to define program related in the digital context 
at this time  it is too early to assess what economic impact  if any  a final decision by the fcc that electronic program guide data in digital signals is not program related  would have on the company s guide plus and tv guide on screen interactive program guide services

certain risks affecting business  operating results and financial condition this section highlights specific risks affecting our business  operating results and financial condition 
the order in which the risks appear is not intended as an indication of their relative weight or importance 
risks related to recent developments our senior management team only recently joined the company 
recently  our senior management team has undergone major changes with the addition of a new chief executive officer and acting chief financial officer and several other senior executives  including a new senior management team at tv guide magazine 
we are currently conducting a search for a permanent chief financial officer 
the structure of our board of directors also has been significantly changed 
we are subject to certain risks associated with this new management structure  including  among others  risks relating to employee and business relations  managerial efficiency and effectiveness and overall familiarity with our business and operations 
we cannot assure you that this major restructuring of our board of directors and senior management team will not adversely affect our results of operations 
our new management has spent considerable time and effort dealing with internal and external investigations 
in addition to the challenges of the sec investigation  class action and related lawsuits and ongoing patent and antitrust litigation described below  our new management has spent considerable time and effort dealing with internal and external investigations involving our previous accounting policies  disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance procedures 
we cannot assure you that the significant time and effort spent will not adversely affect our operations 
we cannot assure you that we will not discover additional instances of historical breakdowns in controls  policies and procedures affecting our previously issued financial statements 
following our management and corporate governance restructuring  we have made significant changes in our internal controls  our disclosure controls  policies and procedures  and our corporate governance policies and procedures 
while the company believes that the restructuring and our newly implemented controls  policies and procedures will prevent the occurrence of financial reporting problems in the future  there can be no assurance that we will not discover additional instances of historical breakdowns in our internal controls  policies and procedures of the types that led to the recent restatements of our historical financial results 
we face risks related to an sec investigation and securities litigation 
the sec has issued a formal order of investigation to determine whether the company has violated the federal securities laws 
although the company has fully cooperated with the sec in this matter and intends to continue to fully cooperate  the sec may determine that the company has violated federal securities laws 
we cannot predict when this investigation will be completed or its outcome 
if the sec makes a determination that the company has violated federal securities laws  the company may face sanctions  including  but not limited to  significant monetary penalties and injunctive relief 
in addition  the company has been named a defendant in a number of class action and related lawsuits 
the findings and outcome of the sec investigation may affect the class action and derivative lawsuits that are pending 
we are generally obliged  to the extent permitted by law  to indemnify our directors and our former directors and officers who are named defendants in some of these lawsuits 
we are unable to estimate what our liability in these matters may be  and we may be required to pay judgments or settlements and incur expenses in aggregate amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
on august   the company received a nasdaq staff determination that its securities are subject to delisting from the nasdaq stock market because the company failed to file its form q for the quarter ended june  on or before august  on november   the nasdaq listing qualifications panel nasdaq panel granted the company s request for an exception to continue its listing on the nasdaq stock market subject to satisfying certain conditions 
the company has satisfied these conditions as of the date hereof 
however  to remain in compliance with nasdaq s order  the company must solicit proxies and hold an annual meeting of stockholders on or before june  the company has scheduled an annual meeting for may   and expects to mail proxy materials in april 
furthermore  to fully comply with the terms of this exception  the company must be able to demonstrate compliance with all requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq stock market 
if the company fails to meet any of these conditions  our securities may be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
in addition  the nasdaq panel reserved the right to modify  alter or extend the terms of this exception 
if the nasdaq panel altered or modified the terms of this exception and the company was unable to meet the modified terms  our securities may be delisted from the nasdaq stock market 
risks related to our business the marketing and market acceptance of our interactive program guides may not be as rapid as we expected 
the market for our ipgs has only recently begun to develop  is rapidly evolving and is increasingly competitive 
demand and market acceptance for our ipgs are subject to uncertainty and risk 
we cannot predict whether  or how fast  this market will grow or how long it can be sustained 
for guide plus and tv guide on screen  which are incorporated in consumer electronics products  the deployment rate will depend on the strength or weakness of the consumer electronics industry  and in particular  the sale of television sets  hard disk recorders and dvd recorders 
for tv guide interactive  which is incorporated into digital set top boxes  the deployment rate will be dependent on the growth of digital cable television subscribers and our penetration for the market for ipgs for these subscribers 
purchases of consumer electronics products and digital cable television subscriptions are largely discretionary and may be affected by general economic trends in the countries or regions in which such products or subscriptions are offered 
if the market for our ipgs develops more slowly than expected or becomes saturated with competitors  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
we are re evaluating the strategy for our us cable and satellite ipg business in light of increased competition  slower than expected growth in distribution and advertising revenue  and unexpected adverse rulings in certain cases 
we depend on revenues from digital cable subscribers 
we derive subscription revenues and other revenue streams from the carriage of our ipg and tvg network on digital cable systems 
digital cable television subscriptions are generally priced at a premium to analog cable television service and represent discretionary expenditures for consumers 
consequently  general economic trends may result in fluctuations in the number of subscribers and the amount of revenue received by the company under this recurring revenue model 
vcr plus revenues have declined and may decline further due to full penetration of the product in a declining market 
revenues derived from vcr plus have declined and may decline further due to the fact that virtually all major vcr manufacturers have licensed the vcr plus technology and the fact that we have already expanded into most major markets worldwide 
the worldwide shipment of vcrs is expected to decline as vcrs are replaced by digital recording devices such as hard disk recorders and dvd recorders 
although vcr plus is now being incorporated into some digital recording devices  there is no assurance that this practice will become widespread 
in addition  our ipg technology may be more relevant than our vcr plus technology for these digital recording devices 
tv guide magazine  which is a significant business  has experienced significant declines in circulation and operating results and such declines may continue 
we provide tv guide magazine to households and newsstands and customized monthly program guides to customers of cable and satellite service providers 
tv guide magazine has seen circulation decline significantly over the past several years 
the primary cause of this decline is increased competition from free television listings included in local newspapers  electronic program guides incorporated into digital cable and satellite services  and other sources 
declines in tv guide magazine s circulation and operating results may continue and could be significant 
our c band business  which is a significant business  is declining as a result of competition from superior technologies 
we market and distribute entertainment programming to c band satellite dish owners in the united states through our approximately owned subsidiary  superstar netlink 
the c band business is declining primarily as a result of competition from dbs and cable television systems 
dbs providers such as dish network and directv transmit on the ku band  which uses a higher power signal than c band satellites  enabling dbs customers to use smaller  less obtrusive satellite dishes 
in addition  dbs and digital cable operators transmit digital signals that allow for a larger number of channels  including local network stations  with better audio and video quality than analog systems 
in  superstar netlink entered into a marketing alliance agreement to promote and solicit orders for dish network 
in exchange  superstar netlink receives an initial commission for each superstar netlink subscriber who subscribes to dish network and a monthly residual commission over the life of the agreement  which expires at the end of we expect the decline in our c band business to continue and this decline may be accelerated by our agreement with dish network 
continued consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry could change the terms of existing agreements  the impact of these changes is not certain 
we have entered into agreements with a large number of cable msos for distribution of our ipgs 
if  as expected  consolidation of the cable and satellite broadcasting industry continues  some of these agreements may be affected by mergers  acquisitions or system swaps 
although the company has sought to protect itself against any negative consequences resulting from such transactions with provisions in our agreements with cable msos  it is conceivable that certain combinations of events could change the terms of the agreements and such changes could negatively affect our results of operations 
in addition  some of our agreements with msos allow for the agreement to be terminated prior to the scheduled expiration date at the option of the service provider 
the exercise of such unilateral termination rights could have a material adverse effect on the amount of revenue received by the company under these agreements 
our business may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for consumer electronics devices employing our technologies 
we derive significant revenues from manufacturer license fees for our vcr plus and ipg technologies based on the number of units shipped 
we do not manufacture hardware  but rather depend on the cooperation of consumer electronics manufacturers to incorporate our technology into their products 
many of our license agreements do not require manufacturers to include our technology in any specific number or percentage of units  and only a few of these agreements guarantee a minimum aggregate licensing fee 
demand for new consumer electronics devices  such as television sets  vcrs  integrated satellite receiver decoders  dvd recorders  hard disk recorders  personal computers and internet appliances  may be adversely impacted by increasing market saturation  durability of products in the marketplace  new competing products and alternate consumer entertainment options 
as a result  our future operating results may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in sales of consumer electronics devices employing our technologies 
dependence on the cooperation of cable systems  television broadcasters  publications and data providers could adversely affect our revenues 
ipg program data and advertising data is delivered to network headends  cable headends  and broadcast stations for inclusion in the vbi of television signals for delivery to consumer electronics devices and to local affiliate cable systems for delivery to set top boxes in subscribers homes via the out of band frequencies of local cable systems 
there can be no assurance that these delivery mechanisms will distribute the data without error or that the agreements governing certain of these relationships can be maintained on economical terms 
to populate consumer products devices  we have arrangements for carriage of our data in the vbi of television stations included in the public broadcasting network  independently owned stations  and stations owned and operated by various station group owners 
our contract related to the public broadcasting network stations covers substantially all of the territory required to be covered to effectively transmit our data for delivery to consumer product devices incorporating our ipgs 
we nevertheless continue to rely on arrangements  which are not long term  with station group owners and operators and independently owned stations for vbi carriage of our program guide and advertising data 
until we fully deploy our vbi carriage contract related to the public broadcasting network stations  we cannot assure you that our carriage arrangements with station group owners and operators and independently owned operators will continue 
furthermore  even if we have full deployment  our data broadcast through the vbi can be  and has been in the past in certain markets  deleted or modified by some of the local cable systems 
widespread deletion or modification of such data could have a material adverse impact on the company s guide plus or tv guide on screen business 
in addition  we purchase some of our program guide information from commercial vendors 
the quality  accuracy or timeliness of such data may not continue to meet our standards or be acceptable to consumers 
our vcr plus system relies on consumer access to pluscode numbers through licensed publications 
we are dependent on the maintenance and renewal of agreements governing the pluscode publications to ensure the distribution of the pluscodes 
distribution of tv guide channel is subject to voluntary arrangements with service providers 
the success of tv guide channel is dependent upon achieving broad distribution by msos and other service providers 
the majority of tv guide channel s service provider customers are not under long term license agreements  which could result in termination of the service at anytime with minimal prior notice of such discontinuation 
a significant decline in distribution of the tv guide channel could have a material adverse effect on the amount of licensing and advertising revenue received by the company 
seasonality and variability of consumer electronic product shipments and newsstand sales of our print products may affect our revenues and results of operations on a quarterly or annual basis 
shipments of consumer electronics products tend to be higher in the third and fourth calendar quarters 
general advertising also tends to be higher in the fourth quarter 
in addition  manufacturer shipments vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including retail inventory levels and retail promotional activities 
newsstand sales of our print products tend to be higher in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
as a result  we may experience variability in our licensing and advertising revenues 
paper and postal price increases can materially raise our costs associated with the production and delivery of the tv guide print products  including tv guide magazine 
the price of paper can be a significant factor affecting tv guide magazine s operating performance 
we do not hedge against increases in paper costs 
if paper prices do increase and we cannot pass these costs on to our customers  the increases may have a material adverse effect on us 
postage for product distribution and direct mail solicitations is also a significant  uncontrollable expense to us 
postal rates increased in february  july and again in june and are likely to increase in the future 
we may not be able to comply with our bank covenants 
our wholly owned subsidiary  tv guide  inc tv guide  has a million six year revolving credit facility and a million term loan 
the credit facility and the term loan expire in february and contain certain financial covenants with which we must comply 
the debt level and the covenants contained in these debt instruments could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business because certain financing options may be limited or prohibited 
in particular  tv guide may not be able to maintain compliance with a financial covenant in its term loan agreement during the coming twelve months 
while the company believes that its current financial position provides adequate liquidity to refinance the loans or seek other alternatives before the financial covenant is violated  we cannot assure you that any measures taken to maintain compliance or to mitigate the effects of any noncompliance will be successful 
our stock price has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock has historically been volatile 
it is likely that the market price of our common stock will continue to be subject to significant fluctuations 
we believe that future announcements concerning us  our competitors or our principal customers  including technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  litigation or changes in earnings estimated by analysts or any future decision to restate any of our financial statements may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially in the future 
sales of substantial amounts of outstanding common stock in the public market could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
further  in recent years the stock market has experienced extreme price fluctuations in equity securities of technology and media companies 
such price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  such as armed hostilities  acts of terrorism  civil disturbances  recessions  international currency fluctuations  or tariffs and other trade barriers  may materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
any infringement by us on patent rights of others could result in litigation 
patents of third parties may have an important bearing on our ability to offer certain products and services 
many of our competitors as well as other companies and individuals have obtained  and may be expected to obtain in the future  patents that concern products or services related to the types of products and services we plan to offer 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be aware of all patents containing claims that may pose a risk of infringement by our products and services 
in addition  patent applications in the united states are generally confidential until a patent is issued  so we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products and services may be covered or asserted to be covered by claims contained in pending patent applications 
if one or more of our products or services is found to infringe patents held by others  we may be required to stop developing or marketing the products or services  to obtain licenses to develop and market the products or services from the holders of the patents or to redesign the products or services in such a way as to avoid infringing the patent claims 
we cannot assess the extent to which we may be required in the future to obtain licenses with respect to patents held by others  whether the licenses would be available or  if available  whether we would be able to obtain the licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
if we were unable to obtain the licenses  we might not be able to redesign our products or services to avoid infringement 
an unfavorable outcome of intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings may adversely affect our business and operating results 
our results may be affected by the outcome of pending and future litigation and the protection and validity of patents and other intellectual property rights 
our patents and other intellectual property rights are important competitive tools and many generate income under license agreements 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the united states or abroad 
furthermore  we are subject to various antitrust claims asserted by third parties in connection with pending intellectual property litigation 
some of these matters involve potential compensatory  punitive or treble damage claims  or sanctions that  if granted  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
unfavorable rulings in the company s legal proceedings  including those described in item  legal proceedings  and in note  legal proceedings  to consolidated financial statements  may have a negative impact on the company that may be greater or smaller depending on the nature of the rulings 
in addition  we are currently  and from time to time in the future may be  subject to various other claims  investigations  legal and administrative cases and proceedings whether civil or criminal or lawsuits by governmental agencies or private parties 
if the results of such investigations  proceedings or suits are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to successfully defend against third party lawsuits  we may be required to pay money damages or may be subject to fines  penalties  injunctions or other censure that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
even if we adequately address the issues raised by an investigation or proceeding or successfully defend a third party lawsuit or counterclaim  we may have to devote significant money and management resources to address these issues  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan or back up system  and a disaster could severely damage our operations 
we currently do not have a comprehensive disaster recovery plan in effect and do not have fully redundant systems for certain critical operations 
although we have some technology redundancy and back up capabilities for our production  publishing and transmission capabilities  there are single points of failure within our processes and technology that  in the event of a catastrophic disruption  would cause us to lose our ability to provide transmission or publishing capabilities 
in that event  we would have to operate at reduced service levels that could severely negatively affect our relationships with our customers  our revenue generation and our brand 
there are initiatives underway to prioritize our recovery requirements and we are developing strategies for our mission critical business operations and technology 
this will be the basis for the development and implementation of business continuity and disaster recovery plans 
our interests may diverge from those of substantial stockholders 
news corporation has significant influence over our business because of its beneficial ownership of our common stock and the number of its executives who serve on our board of directors 
there can be no assurance that its interests are aligned with that of the company s other shareholders 
investor interests can differ from each other and from other corporate interests and it is possible that this significant stockholder with a stake in corporate management may have interests that differ from those of other stockholders and of the company itself 
if news corporation were to sell large amounts of its holdings  our stock price could decline and we could find it difficult to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
in addition  this concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring control over us at a premium over the then current market price of our common stock 
risks related to our industry we face competition in many areas and the competition could negatively impact our operating results 
we face competition from a wide range of other companies in the communications  advertising  media  entertainment  publishing  information  internet services  software and technology fields 
the competitive environment could  among other results  require price reductions for our products  require increased spending on marketing and product development  limit our ability to develop new products and services  limit our ability to expand our customer base or even result in attrition in our customer base 
any of these occurrences could negatively impact our operating results 
many of our competitors have greater financial and human resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors can compete more effectively by offering customers better pricing and other terms and conditions  including indemnifying customers against patent infringement claims 
new products and rapid technological change may adversely affect our operations 
the emergence of new consumer entertainment products and technologies  changes in consumer preferences and other factors may limit the life cycle of our technologies and any future products we might develop 
our future operations could be adversely impacted by our ability to identify emerging trends in our markets and to develop and market new products and services that respond to competitive offerings  technological changes and changing consumer preferences in a timely manner and at competitive costs 
although we believe that we will continue to develop attractive new products  the industry in which we operate is characterized by rapid changes  including technological changes 
the process of developing and marketing new products is inherently complex and uncertain  and there are a number of risks  including the following we cannot assure you that we will have adequate funding and resources necessary for investments in new products and technologies  we cannot assure you that our long term investments and commitment of significant resources will result in successful new products or technologies  we cannot assure you that we can anticipate successfully the new products and technologies which will gain market acceptance and that such products can be successfully marketed  we cannot assure you that our newly developed products or technologies can be successfully protected as proprietary intellectual property rights or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others  and our products may become obsolete due to rapid advancements in technology and changes in consumer preferences 
our failure to anticipate adequately changes in the industry and the market  and to develop attractive new products  including any of the risks described above  may reduce our future growth and profitability and may adversely affect our business results and financial condition 
digital recapture could adversely affect carriage of our analog products 
cable television is transmitted on a limited frequency spectrum that must be allocated between multiple analog and digital channels 
as digital penetration increases  msos are reclaiming analog bandwidth to launch more digital networks and interactive television services  and are likely to continue this recapture until such time as they rebuild their plants to increase bandwidth or there is stability in the mix of analog and digital carriage 
if this trend continues  digital recapture may result in a significant decline in the distribution of our analog tv guide channel  which could negatively impact our operating results 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the satellite transmission  cable and telecommunications industries are subject to federal regulatory conditions  including fcc licensing and other requirements 
these industries are also often subject to extensive regulation by local and state authorities 
while most cable and telecommunications industry regulations do not apply directly to the company  they affect programming distributors  a primary customer for our products and services 
certain programming sold by our superstar netlink subsidiary is subject to the satellite home viewer improvement act of in  the fcc issued a notice of inquiry concerning interactive television services  which may indicate that the fcc intends to promulgate rules that could directly or indirectly affect our ipg business 
in addition  our tvg network is subject to certain state and federal laws and regulations applicable to pari mutuel wagering on horse races and its growth may be significantly affected by such laws and regulations 
future developments relating to any of these regulatory matters may adversely affect our business

in response  on september   diva filed an adversary complaint against the company for breach of contract and other claims purportedly based upon the company s decision to terminate the asset purchase agreement

in late  we engaged a new independent accounting firm to audit our historical consolidated annual financial statements and to review the company s historical consolidated unaudited interim financial statements 
since that engagement  we have conducted a review of our accounting policies and the application of those policies to various types of transactions 
that review is now complete 
as a result of the review  we have made various adjustments that have been included in restatements of certain of our historical financial statements 
the restatements are described in the amendments to our annual report on form k for our fiscal year ended december   and to our quarterly reports on form q for each of our fiscal quarters ended march   june  and september   which were filed with the sec concurrently with the filing of this annual report on form k 
the aggregate effect that these restatements  when combined with those previously reported in our filings with the sec in november  have had on our results of operations for the year ended december   the nine months ended december  and the year ended march  is as follows consolidated revenues have decreased by million  million and million  respectively  and consolidated loss has increased by million  million and decreased by million  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting the estimates could differ markedly from our current expectations 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial statements 
revenue recognition general we follow the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition sop and staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  for revenue recognition 
under sop and sab  four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized i there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or service has been rendered  iii the price is fixed or determinable and iv collection is reasonably assured 
we have entered into various arrangements that contain multiple elements  including licensing fees and advertising on various platforms  which may be in more than one of our segments multiple element arrangements 
for example  a customer may license certain of our technology and purchase an advertising package from us to provide the customer with print advertising in tv guide magazine  an online platform or on the ipg platform 
multiple element arrangements may include situations where we are both a vendor and a cooperative advertiser 
see multiple element arrangements below 
license fees we license our proprietary technologies to consumer electronics manufacturers and to service providers including msos and other owners and operators of cable television systems  telephone networks  internet service providers  internet websites  direct to home broadcast satellite providers  wireless systems and other multi channel video programming distributors 
it is our normal practice to enter into written agreements with our customers 
we generally recognize such license fees based on a per unit shipped model with consumer electronics manufacturers or a per subscriber model with service providers 
our revenues from per unit license fees are based on units reported shipped in the period by the manufacturers 
revenues from per subscriber fees are recognized in the month services are provided by a licensee  as reported to us by the licensee 
see multiple element arrangements below 
revenues from annual and other license fees generally are recognized based on the specific terms of the license agreements 
for instance  we had an arrangement under which substantial flat fees were paid upfront in addition to ongoing per unit license fees 
in such cases  the pre paid fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement 
in certain cases  we will license our technology for an unlimited number of units over a specified period of time and for which we have continuing obligations 
we record the fees associated with these arrangements on a straight line basis over the specified term 
in addition  we have licensing arrangements with msos under which we share a portion of the interactive platform advertising revenue that we generate through the mso 
in some cases  we guarantee that a substantial portion of the mso s license fees paid to us will be reimbursed to the mso through our ad sharing obligation 
to the extent the ad sharing fees are not sufficient to meet these guarantees  we are obligated to purchase advertising on the mso s platform 
because the license fee is not fixed nor determinable until resolution of the sharing or advertising buyback  which is typically settled quarterly  the advertising buyback guarantees and advertising sharing are netted against the license fees so that only a net license fee amount is recognized 
from time to time  the license agreement between us and a licensee may expire 
while a new license agreement is being negotiated  the licensee may continue to ship the same units or the same services may continue to be deployed containing our patented or proprietary technologies and the licensee continues to report units shipped or subscriber information on a periodic basis 
license and subscriber fees may continue to be received at the old contract rates and on a timely basis 
in such cases  we continue to recognize license and subscriber fee revenue 
however  revenue is not recognized when collection is not reasonably assured and in no case when payment is not received for greater than days which is the longest standard customer payment term related to certain mso contracts 
multiple element arrangements in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue by each of the sectors  as discussed above 
revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar cash arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
when sufficient evidence of the fair values of the individual elements does not exist  revenue is not allocated among them until that evidence exists 
instead  the revenue is recognized as earned using revenue recognition principles applicable to the entire arrangement as if it were a single element arrangement 
at this time  in all instances where ipg advertising is part of a multiple element transaction  no revenue is allocated to ipg advertising or the interactive platform sector for accounting purposes  and all revenue is allocated to other elements of the transaction and other sectors 
for accounting purposes  we expect to record ipg advertising associated with multiple element arrangements in this manner until such time as we conclude that we can determine the fair value of ipg advertising in a reliable  verifiable and objective manner 
purchase accounting the company s acquisitions of tv guide and skymall have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly impact net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset  there may be less amortization expense recorded in a given period 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
as permitted by the accounting rules  we used the one year period following the consummation of the acquisitions to obtain the information necessary to finalize estimates of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired 
one of the areas that requires more judgment in determining fair values and useful lives is intangible assets 
to assist in this process  we obtained appraisals from independent valuation firms for certain significant tangible and intangible assets and liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets  long lived assets to be disposed of and intangible assets we review our long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends or if future performance is below historical trends 
we periodically review intangible assets and goodwill for impairment using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
we have a significant amount of property and equipment and intangible assets 
the determination as to whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable involves management s judgment 
in addition  should we conclude that recoverability of an asset is in question  the estimate of undiscounted future operating cash flows is used to determine whether an asset is recoverable and  if not  the final determination of the fair value of the asset is also based on the judgment of management 
these judgments can be impacted by a variety of underlying assumptions  such as the general business climate  effectiveness of competition and supply and cost of resources 
accordingly  actual results can differ significantly from the assumptions made by management in making its estimates 
future changes in management s estimates could result in indicators of impairment and actual impairment charges where none exists as of the date of this report 
new accounting standards effective january   eliminate the impairment recoverability tests for certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and require that such assets be valued at the lower of their carrying value or fair value 
goodwill is no longer amortized but remains subject to an annual impairment test performed at the reporting unit level 
fair value is determined primarily using the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset under review  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
changes in estimates of future cash flows could result in a write down of the asset in a future period 
absent any interim evidence of impairments  we will perform our annual impairment test of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles for all reporting units on october of each year 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
we have income both from foreign and domestic sources 
in the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating both our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
assessment of our actual current tax exposure includes assessing tax strategies  the status of tax audits and open audit periods with the taxing authorities 
to the extent that we have deferred tax assets  we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable temporary differences  tax strategies or future taxable income and to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
as of december   we have established a valuation allowance of million against our deferred tax assets 
in the future  we may adjust our estimates of the amount of valuation allowance needed and such adjustment would impact our provision for income taxes in the period of such change 
legal and other loss contingencies a significant amount of management estimation is required in determining when  or if  an accrual should be recorded for a contingent matter and the amount of such accrual  if any 
due to the uncertainty of determining the likelihood of a future event occurring and the potential financial statement impact of such an event  it is possible that upon further development or resolution of a contingent matter  a charge could be recorded in a future period that would be material to the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have significant amounts due to us from our customers 
we continuously evaluate our outstanding accounts receivable for collectibility 
this evaluation involves management s judgment in assessing the aging of the amounts due to us and in reviewing the credit worthiness of each customer 
should a customer s financial condition deteriorate in a manner that could decrease the customer s ability to pay amounts due to us  we might be required to provide additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which would reduce our earnings 
investments our investments include investments available for sale that are carried at fair value  investments accounted for using the cost method of accounting and investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
a judgmental aspect of accounting for investments involves determining whether an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained 
if it has been determined that an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value  by a charge to earnings 
such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that are considered by the company in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the subject investment  and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information such as budgets  business plans or financial statements in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults  and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of the investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs a number of quantitative and qualitative factors in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the value of an investment is deemed to have occurred 
the following table sets forth certain financial information for the company for the years ended december  and and the nine months ended december   to enhance comparability  the table also includes certain financial information for the company for the twelve months ended december year ended december nine months ended december  twelve months ended december  unaudited in thousands statement of operations data revenues operating expenses operating expenses  exclusive of expenses shown below stock compensation depreciation and amortization impairment of intangible assets operating loss interest expense other expense income  net loss before income taxes  extraordinary item and cumulative effect of an accounting change income tax benefit loss before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of an accounting change extraordinary loss on debt extinguishment  net of tax cumulative effect of an accounting change  net of tax net loss other financial data net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities ebitda effective july  and july   the company s consolidated operating results include the operating results of skymall and tv guide  respectively 
skymall and tv guide were acquired in transactions accounted for as purchases 
effective april  the consolidated operating results exclude the operating results of the business that distributes the wgn superstation signal  which was sold 
on november   the board of directors of the company approved the change of the company s fiscal year end from march to december ebitda is defined as operating loss income  excluding stock compensation  depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
due to purchase accounting related to our mergers with tv guide on july  and skymall on july   the results of operations since july  reflect significant increases in depreciation and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  our business sectors are measured based on ebitda 
we believe ebitda to be relevant and useful information as ebitda is the primary measure used by our management to measure the operating profits or losses of our business 
ebitda is one of several metrics used by our management to measure the cash generated from our operations 
ebitda is presented supplementally  as we believe it is a standard measure commonly reported and widely used by analysts  investors and others associated with our industry 
however  ebitda does not take into account substantial costs of doing business  such as income taxes and interest expense 
while many in the financial community consider ebitda to be an important measure of comparative operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  operating income  net income  cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that are presented in the financial statements included in this report 
additionally  our calculations of ebitda may be different than the calculation used by other companies and  therefore  comparability may be affected 
see reconciliation of ebitda to consolidated operating loss income below 
reported results for the transition period from april  to december  have been combined with operating results for the three months ended march  to enhance comparability 
consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were billion  a decrease of million or  compared to the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to a million decrease in tv guide magazine s newsstand and subscription revenues  a million decrease in superstar netlink c band subscriber revenues  and a million decrease in license fees from dss set top box manufacturers  partially offset by a million increase in revenues at tvg network 
tv guide magazine s rate base and circulation was reduced from million copies to million copies in june subsequently  that rate base was maintained through year end and  although bulk sold subscriptions increased from million copies at december  to million copies at december   causing subscription revenue to fall due to the lower margin of bulk versus other paid circulation 
the decrease in rate base and circulation  and general advertising weakness caused tv guide magazine s advertising revenue to decline million  although declines during the first three quarters of were offset in the fourth quarter when advertising revenues increased or million  compared to advertising revenue in the fourth quarter of subscription revenues relating to the company s superstar netlink c band business continued to decline in  as customers switched to cable or dbs services 
the decline in subscribers has been accelerated due to the company s marketing alliance agreement with dish network to convert our c band customers to dish network s dbs service 
license fee revenues relating the sale of proprietary ipg technology to manufacturers of set top boxes for the us dss market declined dramatically in  due to slowing growth in the shipment of set top boxes  lower pricing per box due to shifts in market share  and the expiration of agreements with two key manufacturers 
revenues at tvg more than tripled due to increases in distribution and the launch of the tvg s wagering business in california 
for the year ended december   operating expenses were million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the decrease in operating expenses was a result of the general cost controls in effect throughout the company 
the decreases were also attributable to reductions in tv guide magazine production expenses for paper  printing  and postage  and reduced programming costs for superstar netlink 
these decreases were partially offset by the additional expenses attributable to skymall  professional fees associated with the november management and corporate governance restructuring and the restatement of the company s historical financial statements  and termination fees totaling million associated with this restructuring 
stock compensation expense is primarily comprised of the amortization of the portion of the purchase price of acquired businesses assigned to unearned compensation for unvested stock options assumed by the company 
the unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options using an accelerated method 
also included is the amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of options to the company s former chief executive officer in and amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of restricted stock in connection with the management restructuring 
for the year ended december   stock compensation expense was million  which included million of unearned compensation amortization and million related to restricted stock issued in connection with our management and corporate governance restructuring in in  stock compensation expenses were million 
depreciation and amortization during the year ended december   was million  a decrease of million compared to the decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily a result of the adoption of the provisions of statement  which became effective january  statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement see note  goodwill and other intangible assets  to consolidated financial statements 
other intangible assets with definite lives acquired in transactions accounted for as purchases are still amortized and the amount of that amortization is significant 
impairment of intangible assets in represents a write down of the carrying amount of finite lived intangible assets billion  goodwill billion and indefinite lived intangibles million to their fair values based on analyses performed as of june   october   and december  interest expense was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the decrease in interest expense was attributable to lower debt levels  together with lower interest rates during other expense  net decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in other expense was primarily due to a million decrease in write downs of the carrying value of certain investments  as compared with the prior year 
in  write downs for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments aggregated million compared to million in the company has an interest in three related joint ventures that are each accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
during the year ended december   one of these joint ventures experienced an other than temporary decline in the value of its available for sale equity investments 
as a result of this decline  the company recorded in other expenses a charge of million  representing the company s share of this decline 
at december   the company s carrying value of this investment was million 
during the year ended december   this joint venture s financial condition deteriorated significantly  including a substantial decrease in its revenues and cash shortages 
because of these facts  management has determined that it is not likely that the company s investment will be recovered in the future  and recorded an additional charge of million during the fourth quarter of to write off the remaining carrying value of the company s investment 
this charge was recorded as other expenses income  net 
the company has an investment in an entity engaged in developing a satellite system 
the entity experienced operating difficulties and a failed initial public offering 
because of these and other pertinent circumstances  the company determined that its investment realized a decline in value that was other than temporary  and that the recoverability of this investment was not likely 
as a result  during the company recorded a charge of million to write off the carrying value of this investment 
this charge was recorded as other expenses income  net 
also  during the year ended december   certain other investments experienced significant declines in value and the carrying values were deemed by management to be unrecoverable  and thus were written off  resulting in charges of approximately million recorded as other expense 
the income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before income taxes  extraordinary item and cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was in compared to in the net increase in the effective tax rate is primarily due to the change in the treatment of amortization of goodwill in accordance with statement  which has no associated impact on the provision for income taxes 
in addition  the overall effective tax rate reported by the company in any single period is impacted by  among other things  the country in which earnings or losses arise  applicable statutory tax rates and withholding tax requirements for particular countries  the availability of net operating loss carry forwards and the availability of tax credits for taxes paid in certain jurisdictions 
because of these factors  it is expected that the company s future tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes may vary from period to period 
the cumulative effect of an accounting change relates to the company s adoption of statement effective january  the company was required to test goodwill and any intangible assets identified as having an indefinite useful life for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement and report any transitional impairment loss as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  in the consolidated statement of operations 
the transitional impairment loss for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets from application of these new rules was billion  net of tax 
year ended december  compared to the twelve month period ended december  revenues for the year ended december  were billion  an increase of million compared to the same period in the increase in revenues was primarily due to million of additional revenues attributable to tv guide  which was acquired by the company on july  the general weakness in the advertising market during impacted most media companies in the united states  including the company 
for additional discussion of advertising revenues  see the company s discussion of pro forma sector operating results below 
operating expenses  excluding stock compensation  depreciation and amortization  impairment of intangible assets were million for the year ended december   an increase of million when compared to the same period in the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased operating costs of million attributable to a full year of tv guide operations coupled with increased patent prosecution costs and increased costs 
stock compensation expense reflects amortization of the portion of the purchase price of tv guide assigned to unearned compensation for unvested tv guide stock options assumed by the company in the tv guide transaction 
the unearned compensation is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of the options 
no similar amortization expense existed in periods prior to the acquisition of tv guide 
stock compensation expense also included million of additional unearned compensation amortization resulting from a senior executive officer that separated from the company 
additionally  amortization of deferred compensation arising from the issuance of in the money options to the company s former chief executive officer totaled million and million in and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization during the year was million  an increase of million compared to the same period in the increase in depreciation and amortization was attributable to a full year of amortization of intangible assets and other depreciation resulting from the acquisition of tv guide 
the company had impairment of goodwill relating to its acquisition of les editions h  an electronic publisher in europe  of million during no similar impairment charges were recorded in the twelve month period ended december  interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase in interest expense was attributable to the debt and capital lease obligations assumed in the tv guide transaction being outstanding for a full year in  offset by lower debt levels and interest rates 
prior to the acquisition of tv guide  the company had no debt 
other income expense  net was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the decrease in other income expense  net was due primarily to a million write down million during the fourth quarter in of certain of the company s technology investments and marketable securities  many of which were acquired as part of the tv guide merger and were recorded at values that existed for technology investments at that time  coupled with lower rates of return on cash investments during compared to included in the amount is a charge of million reflecting the write off of the carrying value of the company s investment in an entity engaged in developing a satellite system 
the entity experienced operating difficulties and a failed initial public offering 
management concluded that the general weakness in the economy had impacted the fair value of these investments in a manner which was other than temporary  by delaying the deployment of underlying technologies  making it difficult for development stage companies to access capital  and by causing sustained periods of depressed stock prices from previous prices 
the provision for income tax benefit as a percentage of loss before income taxes and extraordinary items was for the year ended december  compared to for the same period in the overall effective tax rate reported by the company in any single period is impacted by  among other things  the country in which earnings or losses arise  applicable statutory tax rates and withholding tax requirements for particular countries  the availability of net operating loss carryforwards and the availability of tax credits for taxes paid in certain jurisdictions 
because of these factors  it is expected that the company s future tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes may vary from year to year

our licensing activities include licenses for consumer electronics  cable  satellite  internet appliances  personal computers  and publications worldwide  with major consumer electronics manufacturers and others 
sector operations include research and development  and the creation  protection and licensing of patents and proprietary technologies 
this sector also includes revenues we derive from licensing tvg network s intellectual property to third parties 
originally the technology and licensing sector included only our business relating to our proprietary video recording technologies 
today this business includes products sold under the vcr plus brand in north america  the g code brand in asia and the showview brand in europe collectively referred to as the vcr plus business 
while the business continues to decline in north america with the decline of vcr shipments  the trend in europe and asia is towards continued use of our vcr pluscodes to record television programs in next generation products 
we estimate that approximately of our vcr plus business revenues come from north america  come from asia and come from europe 
because the vast majority of the company s vcr plus business revenues come from regions that continue to use our technology in next generation products  we expect only moderate continued declines in revenues overall 
moreover  we believe that much of the domestic and international vcr plus business will be replaced by hard disk and dvd recorders 
as manufacturers move towards developing and selling hard disk recorders  we have begun licensing our ipg technology as the navigational technology that drives recording in these devices 
in many cases  manufacturers are including both vcr plus technology and ipg technology in the same device 
in the ipg business  the company provides products to both consumer electronics ce manufacturers and to cable and satellite service providers 
our ce business has experienced lower than expected growth due to manufacturers reluctance to incorporate our products in their analog devices because of the high cost of such incorporation 
recently however  the fcc mandated that ce manufacturers transition the majority of their television sales to digital products by the cost of incorporating our ipg products into a digital device is dramatically lower than the cost of incorporating these products into an analog device 
as manufacturers have begun to make plans for this transition  we have seen a growing interest by ce manufacturers to enter into agreements with us to incorporate our products 
management believes that the potential revenue growth that may result from the transition by ce manufacturers to digital television sales may be offset in the short term by lower revenues in our set top box business as a result of our strategy of pursuing recurring license payments from service providers instead of one time up front license fees from ce manufacturers 
in the longer term  management believes that this strategy will result in higher overall revenues 
in october  we received million in cash from a set top box manufacturer to settle outstanding arbitration and litigation proceedings 
of the million cash received  million was in prepayment of a year technology licensing agreement 
this prepayment is being amortized straight line into income over the term of the license 
revenues in the technology and licensing sector for the years ended december  and include million and million  respectively  recognized in connection with this agreement 
at december   million remained to be recognized over the remaining term of the agreement 
license fees from dss set top box suppliers were million and million in and  respectively 
this decline was due primarily to slowing growth in the shipment of set top boxes  lower pricing per box due to shifts in market share  and the expiration of agreements with two key manufacturers 
we are currently in negotiations with both manufacturers regarding potential renewals to their agreements  but there can be no assurances that such negotiations will be successful 
expenses in this sector for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the decrease in expenses is the result of decreases in litigation costs in  primarily due to the significant expenses incurred in relating to the company s itc litigation  and decreases in research and development costs in  offset by provisions for certain legal matters in see note  legal proceedings  to consolidated financial statements 
management believes that due to increasing fragmentation in the providers of digital cable applications  our costs of integrating our ipg technology with all of these providers has and will continue to increase 
moreover  because the ipg industry has become increasingly competitive  the company believes that it will need to continue to invest significantly in its products and services to maintain its competitive position 
interactive platform sector the interactive platform sector is responsible for and derives recurring revenues from advertising and electronic commerce on our interactive platforms and interactive wagering relating to tvg network 
interactive platform sector activities also include the construction and operation of the infrastructure for the delivery of services and advertising to the interactive platforms  media research  and the trafficking  tracking and billing of advertising 
the company s ipg platform is comprised of television sets incorporating the guide plus ipg and digital cable set top boxes incorporating the tv guide interactive ipg  as well as the on line website www 
tvguide 
com 
we collect revenue from interactive wagering activities related to our tvg network  and also conduct electronic commerce on our www 
skymall 
com and www 
tvguide 
com websites 
for the year ended december   revenues for the interactive platform sector were million compared to million for the prior year  an increase of 
currently  revenues in this sector are comprised primarily of advertising revenues earned on our proprietary platforms  including the ipgs and the online web site  www 
tvguide 
com  as well as interactive wagering from tvg network and electronic commerce revenue from www 
skymall 
com 
the increase in revenues in this sector of million is attributable to the launch of advertising enabled ipgs coupled with the increased penetration of such guides into the market place  as well as increased wagering activity at tvg network following the launch into the california market during the early part of the sector also accounted for a full year impact of revenues from skymall  versus only six months in the prior year 
we provide ipgs for cable and satellite service providers  and the licensing revenue and associated costs are accounted for in the technology and licensing sector 
while advertising revenues in this sector will continue to benefit from the positive distribution trends  particularly in the ce segment  discussed above  the increasingly competitive nature of the cable and satellite business could cause the company to scale back its advertising in order to maintain the competitive position of our products 
moreover  the majority of our advertising revenue in the ipg segment of this sector comes from static panel ads  an advertising vehicle that has suffered a significant decrease in advertiser interest 
we are developing more advanced and desirable advertising vehicles for this segment  which are expected to be deployed in or as digital cable becomes more widely available  the popularity of digital sports tiers offered by cable and satellite service providers is increasing 
management believes that this increase in popularity of sports tiers will provide the company with opportunities to secure additional distribution for our tvg network 
while in the past  distribution for tvg network was limited to states in which interactive wagering has been given regulatory clearance  the live sports aspect of the network could allow it to secure additional distribution in other states 
if this additional distribution in other states occurs  management believes that this further distribution should position this business well to expand its advertising and other revenues  and to further expand its wagering revenue if and when other states permit such wagering 
expenses for this sector were million for the year ended december  compared to million for  an increase of 
the increase in expenses of million is primarily attributable to costs incurred to integrate the growing ipg base with the increasing number of cable service providers offering our ipg service  including the new advertising enabled versions of the ipgs 
the sector also included a full year of expenses for skymall compared to only six months in the prior year 
expenses generated by the tvg network business also increased during media and services sector the media and services sector is responsible for the operations of tv guide magazine  tv guide channel  superstar netlink  uvtv  spacecom  skymall catalog sales and other non interactive platforms and media properties 
revenues in this sector consist principally of subscription fees and advertising revenues from the tv guide magazines and the tv guide channel  and programming package revenues from c band households 
we sold the business that distributes the wgn superstation signal in april and acquired skymall in july this sector also includes the advertising revenues  and operating costs associated with  the tvg network business 
for the year ended december   revenues for the media and services sector were million compared to million for the prior year 
revenues in this sector decreased by million  primarily due to decreased revenues earned by tv guide magazine and superstar netlink 
tv guide magazine continues to face declines in circulation due to slower new subscriber growth  lower renewal rates and reduced newsstand sales 
at december   tv guide magazine had a rate base of million  which was not materially different from its rate base at december  however  the number of bulk sold subscriptions increased from million copies at december  to million copies at december  bulk sold subscriptions produce little or no circulation contribution and are of substantially lesser economic value than other sources of circulation 
we expect the volume of circulation other than bulk sold subscriptions of tv guide magazine to continue to decline during however  our new management team at the magazine is engaged in efforts designed to stabilize the paid circulation of the magazine 
in order to achieve this objective  the company intends to make a significant investment in the magazine business during the impact of the circulation decline on revenue was partially offset by an increase in the newsstand price of tv guide magazine  as well as an improvement in year over year advertising revenue in the fourth quarter tv guide channel generated revenue of million in  a increase vs 
 and ebitda of million in  a increase vs 
growth in advertising was largely offset by revenue declines due to lost distribution 
the company believes that the growth in digital cable subscribers could increase the risk that service providers would discontinue carriage of tv guide channel  a network that is viewed as primarily geared towards analog subscribers 
the company plans to moderately increase its investment in this business with the goal of securing long term distribution and repositioning the product for the digital cable environment 
the c band direct to home satellite market  in which superstar netlink operates  continues to decline due to the growth of the newer generation dbs systems and continued cable system expansions 
moreover  superstar netlink s decline has been accelerated due to the success of the company s subscriber conversion program with dish network 
on november   superstar netlink signed an agreement with dish network to promote and solicit orders for dish network 
in exchange  superstar netlink receives an initial commission for each current or past superstar netlink subscriber who subscribes to dish network and a monthly residual commission over the life of the agreement 
the decline in superstar netlink s subscribers as a result of this agreement is expected to continue 
during the year ended december   the number of c band subscribers in the industry decreased by to approximately  subscribers 
at december   superstar netlink provided service to  of these subscribers  a decrease of from the subscribers served by superstar netlink at december  we expect the declines of the subscriber base of the c band industry  and the resulting impacts on revenues in this sector  to continue during and the impacts of the subscriber decline on revenue was partially offset by an increase in the price of programming packages offered by superstar netlink  and revenues earned from the subscriber conversion agreement with dish network 
expenses for this sector were million for compared to million for a significant portion of the expenses in this sector are those attributable to the paper  printing  and postage associated with tv guide magazine  and programming acquired by superstar netlink for programming packages sold to its customers 
the decrease in expenses of million in this sector is primarily due to the decrease in paid circulation of tv guide magazine and reduced programming expenses associated with the decrease in the number of c band subscribers

in addition  the company has million in a segregated account designated as restricted cash pursuant to the november management restructuring agreement  which is scheduled to be paid on may  during  the company paid down million in debt and capital lease obligations  which resulted in outstanding debt and capital lease obligations  both short term and long term  at december  of million 
at december   cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities excluding the million of restricted cash exceeded debt and capital lease obligations by million 
based on past performance and future expectations  the company believes that the anticipated cash flows from operations  and existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances  will be sufficient to satisfy its expected working capital  capital expenditure and debt requirements in the foreseeable future 
the company does not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
net cash flows from operating activities were million for the year ended december  compared to million generated during the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable resulting from the company s exit from the magazine distribution business  and an increase in accrued liabilities  including an accrual for the management restructuring  partially offset by the decline in revenues attributable to the company s ongoing operating activities  decreases in the company s deferred revenue balance  as well as professional fees associated with the company s management and corporate governance restructuring and the november restatement of the company s financial statements 
this cash flow  plus proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million  was used to fund the million for repayment of long term debt and capital lease obligations  million for purchases of marketable securities  million for stock repurchases  million for capital expenditures  and million for distributions to minority interests

the credit facility and term loan are guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of tv guide and the stock of tv guide s subsidiaries is pledged as collateral 
the credit facility and term loan contain various financial covenants including a restriction on tv guide s ability to pay dividends to the company tied to tv guide s leverage ratio

the company believes that tv guide may be unable to maintain compliance with a financial covenant in its term loan agreement that requires it to maintain a fixed charge ratio of ebitda during the latter part of while the company believes that its current financial liquidity position gives it adequate flexibility to refinance the term loan or seek other alternatives before the financial covenant requirements are violated  there can be no assurance that any measures taken to maintain compliance or to mitigate the effects of any noncompliance will be successful

in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables eitf  which is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods after june  this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contain more than one unit of accounting 
separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption can be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary

reconciliation of ebitda to consolidated operating loss income ebitda means operating loss income excluding stock compensation  depreciation and amortization and impairment of intangible assets 
we believe ebitda to be relevant and useful information as these are the primary measures used by our management to measure the operating profit or loss of our business 
ebitda is one of several metrics used by our management to measure the cash generated from our operations 
ebitda should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of its investments 
the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its investment portfolio and variable rate debt issued under tv guide s million six year revolving credit facility and term loan 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio or to hedge for interest rate fluctuations on its debt 
the company invests its excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company protects and preserves its invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or the company may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
because the interest rates on the credit facilities are variable  based upon the banks prime rate or libor  the company s interest expense and cash flow are impacted by interest rate fluctuations 
at december   the company had million in outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the result  based upon the existing outstanding debt  would be an annual increase or decrease of million in interest expense and a corresponding decrease or increase of million in the company s operating cash flow
