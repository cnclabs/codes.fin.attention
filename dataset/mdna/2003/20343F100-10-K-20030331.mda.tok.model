earnings performance  compared to the recently completed fiscal year was influenced by three major factors interest rates held stable for most of the year at historically low levels  the corporation had twelve months of operations for community resource mortgage inc  and the corporation acquired the bank of ridgeway in july 
low interest rates have put pressure on the banks net interest margin  which declined eight basis points from to  but the low rates were also responsible for the unprecedented volume of mortgage loan originations and refinances done by crm

volume and rate variance analysis the table volume and rate variance analysis provides a summary of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in volume and changes in rate 
the changes in volume are the difference between the current and prior year s balances times the prior year s rate 
the changes in rate are the difference between the current and prior year s rate times the prior year s balance 
as reflected in the table  the increase in net interest income of  is mostly due to changes in volume 
the increased volume in the loan portfolio was the strongest factor driving the  increase in interest income 
the decreased cost of time deposits was the strongest factor driving the  decrease in interest expense 
as reflected in the table  the increase in net interest income of  is also mostly due to changes in volume 
the increased volume in the loan portfolio was the strongest factor driving the  increase in interest income 
the increased cost of time deposits was the strongest factor driving the  increase in interest expense 
as discussed above  the prime interest rate has changed dramatically over the last two years 
in january the federal reserve began a series of rate cuts that brought the prime rate down from to by december management expects interest rates to be fairly stable in the near term 
therefore  as in  any improvements in net interest income during are more likely to be the result of changes in volume and the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities than changes in rates

there are no foreign loans and few agricultural loans

loan portfolio composition the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio for the years ended december  through loan category dollar amounts in thousands commercial  financial and agricultural      real estate construction      real estate mortgage      loans to individuals      total loans gross      commercial  financial  and agricultural loans  primarily representing loans made to small and medium size businesses  increased by million or during these loans may be made on either a secured or an unsecured basis 
when taken  security usually consists of liens on inventories  receivables  equipment  and furniture and fixtures 
unsecured business loans are generally short term with emphasis on repayment strengths and low debt to worth ratios 
real estate loans consist of construction loans and loans secured by mortgages 
construction loans are also generally secured with mortgages 
because the corporation s subsidiaries are community banks  real estate loans comprise the bulk of the loan portfolio 
construction loans increased million or in mortgage loans increased million or in the increase in these categories is reflective of the low interest rate environment for the corporation s banks generally do not compete with and year fixed rate secondary market mortgage interest rates  so they have elected to pursue the origination of mortgage loans that could be easily sold into the secondary mortgage market 
community resource mortgage also originates loans for sale in the secondary market 
these loans are generally pre qualified with the underwriters to avoid problems in the sale of the loans 
in  and the corporation sold million  million and million  respectively  in such loans 
these loans are usually sold at par so no gain or loss is recognized at the time of sale 
however  the origination and sale of these loans generates fee income 
the corporation also makes mortgage loans for its own loan portfolio 
such loans are usually for a shorter term than loans originated to sell and usually have a variable rather than a fixed interest rate 
loans to individuals are generally for personal or household purposes  they may be secured or unsecured 
these loans increased million or in interest income from the loan portfolio was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
the average yield on the portfolio was in compared to in maturity distribution of loans the following table sets forth the maturity distribution of the corporation s loans  by type  as of december  as well as the type of interest on loans due after one year 
after one year but within one within five over five category year years years total dollar amounts in thousands commercial     real estate     individuals     total     loans due after one year predetermined interest rate  floating interest rate 
 total  lending risks because extending credit involves a certain degree of risk  management has established loan and credit policies designed to control both the types and amounts of risks assumed and to minimize losses 
such policies include limitations on loan to collateral values for various types of collateral  requirements for appraisals of real estate collateral  problem loan management practices and collection procedures  and nonaccrual and charge off guidelines 
the corporation also conducts internal loan reviews to monitor on an ongoing basis the quality of its portfolio 
the corporation has a geographic concentration of loans within its banks local service areas in south carolina because its primary business is community banking 
concentrations of credit also occur where a number of customers are engaged in similar business activities 
a concentration is generally defined for this purpose as a concentration of loans exceeding of total loans 
the banks regularly review their business lending in an effort to detect  monitor and control such loan concentrations 
at december  the corporation had no such loan concentrations 
nonaccrual and past due loans the nonaccrual  past due and impaired loans and other real estate owned are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation had no restructured loans in the past five years 
dollar amounts in thousands nonaccrual loans accruing loans days or more past due  total  total as a of outstanding loans other real estate owned impaired loans included in non accrual most of the increase in the accruing loans greater than days past due is due to one loan relationship of million 
this account involves principals who are having a legal dispute 
management believes that the bank s collateral position is sufficient that no loss is expected 
approximately half the increase in nonaccrual loans is related to the addition of the ridgeway bank  these credits represent a number of smaller dollar amounts 
management does not expect any material loss in relation to these credits 
gross income that would have been recorded for the years ended december  and  if nonaccrual loans had been performing in accordance with their original terms was approximately  and  respectively 
no interest income was recognized in the current period on the non accrual loans 
the corporation s policies on nonaccrual and impaired loans are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonaccrual loans and impaired loans were not material in relation to the portfolio as a whole in management is aware of no trends  events or uncertainties that would cause nonaccrual loans to change materially in potential problem loans at december  the corporation s internal loan review program had identified  of the portfolio in various loans where information about credit problems of borrowers had caused management to have concerns about the ability of the borrowers to comply with original repayment terms 
the amount identified does not represent management s estimate of the potential losses since a large portion of these loans are secured by real estate and other marketable collateral 
secured versus unsecured loans the corporation does not aggressively seek to make unsecured loans  since these loans may be somewhat more risky than collateralized loans 
there are  however  occasions when it is in the business interests of the corporation to provide short term  unsecured loans to certain customers 
in the corporation had million in unsecured loans or of its loan portfolio 
in the corporation had million in unsecured loans or of its loan portfolio 
such loans are made on the basis of management s evaluation of the customer s ability to repay and net worth 
loan participations periodically  the corporation s banking subsidiaries enter into sales or purchases of loan participations with one another and other financial institutions 
the banks generally only sell participations in loans that would cause the bank to exceed its lending limitation to a single customer 
as the banks lending limits increase they may buy back such loan participations 
such loans are usually commercial in nature  subject to the purchasing bank s standard underwriting requirements  and all risks associated with the portion of the loan sold flow to the purchaser 
at the end of the four banks had  in loan participations purchased 
of these loans  was with nonaffiliated banks 
at the end of the three banks had  in loan participations purchased

other real estate other real estate  consisting of foreclosed properties  was  in   in and in other real estate is initially recorded at the lower of net loan balance or its estimated fair value  net of estimated disposal costs 
the estimate of fair value for foreclosed properties is determined by appraisal at the time of acquisition 
summary of loan loss experience allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses  which is a direct charge to expense 
losses on specific loans are charged against the allowance in the period in which management determines that such loans become uncollectible 
recoveries of previously charged off loans are credited to the allowance 
at december  and the allowance for loan losses was and  respectively  of total loans 
the following table provides details on the changes in the allowance for loan losses during the past five fiscal years

the combination of a relatively short operating history and relatively high asset quality precludes management from establishing a meaningful specific loan loss percentage for the computation of the allowance for each category 
instead management assigns an estimated percentage factor to each in the computation of the overall allowance 
these estimates are not  however  intended to restrict the corporation s ability to respond to losses 
the corporation charges losses from any segment of the portfolio to the allowance  regardless of the allocation 
in general terms  the real estate portfolio is subject to the least risk  followed by the commercial loan portfolio  followed by the loans to individuals portfolio 
the banks internal and external loan review programs from time to time identify loans that are subject to specific weaknesses and such loans are reviewed for a specific loan loss allowance 
the corporation operates four independent community banks in south carolina 
under the provisions of law and regulations governing banks  each board of directors is responsible for determining the adequacy of its bank s loan loss allowance 
in addition  each bank is supervised and regularly examined by the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ or the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic as a normal part of a safety and soundness examination  the bank examiners assess and comment on the adequacy of a bank s allowance for loan losses 
the allowance presented in the consolidated financial statements is on an aggregated basis and as such might differ from the allowance that would be presented if the corporation had only one banking subsidiary 
the nature of community banking is such that the individual loan portfolios are predominantly comprised of small and medium size business and individual loans 
as community banks  there is by definition a geographic concentration of loans within the banks respective city or county 
management at each bank monitors the loan concentrations and loan portfolio quality on an ongoing basis including  but not limited to quarterly analysis of loan concentrations  monthly reporting of past dues  non accruals  and watch loans  and quarterly reporting of loan charge offs and recoveries 
these efforts focus on historical experience and are bolstered by quarterly analysis of local and state economic conditions  which is part of the banks assessment of the adequacy of their allowances for loan losses 
based on the current levels of non performing and other problem loans  management believes that loan charge offs in will be less than the levels as such loans progress through the collection  foreclosure  and repossession process 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses  as of december  is sufficient to absorb the inherent losses that remain in the loan portfolio 
management will continue to closely monitor the levels of non performing and potential problem loans and address the weaknesses in these credits to enhance the amount of ultimate collection or recovery of these assets 
management considers the levels and trends in non performing and past due loans in determining how the provision for loan losses is adjusted

the allowance is allocated to different segments of the portfolio  based on management s expectations of risk in that segment of the portfolio 
this allocation is an estimate only and is not intended to restrict the corporation s ability to respond to losses 
the corporation charges losses from any segment of the portfolio to the allowance  regardless of the allocation 
in reviewing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each period  the corporation considers historical loan loss experience  current economic conditions  loans outstanding  trends in non performing and delinquent loans  and the quality of collateral securing problem loans 
the allowance for loan losses is management s best estimate of probable loan losses that have been incurred as of december  provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to earnings based on management s continuing review and evaluation of the loan portfolio  general economic conditions and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the provision is the amount which management believes  based on its continuing analysis  is necessary to cause the allowance to be adequate 
provisions for loan losses totaled  and  in and  respectively 
the increase in the provision expense in was related to a very small number of commercial loan relationships and is not indicative of a portfolio trend

inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are mostly monetary in nature 
accordingly  the financial results and operations of the corporation are much more affected by changes in interest rates than changes in inflation 
there is  however  a strong correlation between increasing inflation and increasing interest rates 
the impact of inflation has been very moderate over the past several years  about during prospects appear reasonable for continued low inflation  despite some risk related to energy prices and the political and military situation in the middle east 
although inflation does not normally affect a financial institution as dramatically as it does businesses with large investments in plants and inventories  it does have an effect 
during periods of high inflation there are usually corresponding increases in the money supply and banks experience above average growth in assets  loans  and deposits 
general increases in the prices of goods and services also result in increased operating expenses 
liquidity liquidity is the ability to meet current and future obligations through liquidation or maturity of existing assets or the acquisition of additional liabilities 
adequate liquidity is necessary to meet the requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals in a timely and economical manner 
the most manageable sources of liquidity are composed of liabilities  with the primary focus of liquidity management being the ability to attract deposits within the banks service areas 
core deposits total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more provide a relatively stable funding base 
certificates of deposit of  or more are generally more sensitive to changes in rates  so they must be monitored carefully 
asset liquidity is provided by several sources  including amounts due from banks  federal funds sold  and investments available for sale 
the corporation maintains an available for sale investment portfolio 
while investment securities purchased for this portfolio are generally purchased with the intent to be held to maturity  such securities are marketable and occasional sales may occur prior to maturity as part of the process of asset liability and liquidity management 
the corporation has in the past maintained a held to maturity investment portfolio 
securities in this portfolio are generally not considered a primary source of liquidity 
management deliberately maintains a short term maturity schedule for its investments so that there is a continuing stream of maturing investments 
the corporation intends to maintain a short term investment portfolio in order to continue to be able to supply liquidity to its loan portfolio and for customer withdrawals 
the corporation has substantially more liabilities that mature in the next months than it has assets maturing in the same period 
further  the corporation has legal obligations to extend credit pursuant to loan commitments  lines of credit and standby letters of credit which totaled   and  respectively  at december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  based on its historical experience  and that of similar financial institutions  the corporation believes that it is unlikely that so many deposits would be withdrawn  without being replaced by other deposits  and extensions of credit would be required  that the corporation would be unable to meet its liquidity needs with the proceeds of maturing assets  in the ordinary course of business 
the corporation also maintains various federal funds lines of credit with correspondent banks and is able to borrow from the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve s discount window 
the corporation  through its banks  has a demonstrated ability to attract deposits from its market area 
deposits have grown from million in to over million in this stable growing base of deposits is the major source of operating liquidity 
the corporation s long term liquidity needs are expected to be primarily affected by the maturing of long term certificates of deposit 
at december  the corporation had approximately million in certificates of deposit and other obligations maturing in one to five years 
the corporation had million in obligations maturing after five years 
the corporation s assets maturing in the same periods were million and million  respectively 
with a substantially larger dollar amount of assets maturing in both periods than liabilities  the corporation believes that it will not have any significant long term liquidity problems 
in the opinion of management  the current and projected liquidity position is adequate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the corporation s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  deposit and borrowing activities 
management actively monitors and manages its interest rate risk exposure 
although the corporation manages other risks  such as credit quality and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  management considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk and this risk could potentially have the largest material effect on the corporation s financial condition and results of operations 
other types of market risks such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk do not arise in the normal course of community banking activities 
achieving consistent growth in net interest income is the primary goal of the corporation s asset liability function 
the corporation attempts to control the mix and maturities of assets and liabilities to achieve consistent growth in net interest income despite changes in market interest rates 
the corporation seeks to accomplish this goal while maintaining adequate liquidity and capital 
the corporation s asset liability mix is sufficiently balanced so that the effect of interest rates moving in either direction is not expected to be material over time 
the corporation s asset liability committee uses a simulation model to assist in achieving consistent growth in net interest income while managing interest rate risk 
the model takes into account interest rate changes as well as changes in the mix and volume of assets and liabilities 
the model simulates the corporation s balance sheet and income statement under several different rate scenarios 
the model s inputs such as interest rates and levels of loans and deposits are updated on a quarterly basis in order to obtain the most accurate forecast possible 
the forecast presents information over a twelve month period 
it reports a base case in which interest rates remain flat and reports variations that occur when rates increase and decrease and basis points 
according to the model  as of december  the corporation is positioned so that net interest income would increase  and net income would increase  if interest rates were to rise basis points in the next twelve months 
conversely  net interest income would decline  and net income would decline  if interest rates were to decline basis points 
computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates and loan prepayment  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the corporation could undertake in response to changes in interest rates or the effects of responses by others 
the market risk table  which follows this discussion  shows the corporation s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the corporation uses certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities 
for assets  expected maturities are based upon contractual maturity  projected repayments  and prepayment of principal and potential calls 
for core deposits without contractual maturity ie  interest checking  savings and money market accounts  the table presents principal cash flows based on management s judgment concerning their most likely runoff 
the actual maturities and runoff could vary substantially if future prepayments  runoff and calls differ from the corporation s historical experience

at december  on a cumulative basis through twelve months  rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets  by million 
the liability sensitive position is largely due to the assumption that the banks million in interest bearing transaction accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts will reprice within a year 
this assumption may or may not be valid  since these accounts vary greatly in their sensitivity to interest rate changes in the market
