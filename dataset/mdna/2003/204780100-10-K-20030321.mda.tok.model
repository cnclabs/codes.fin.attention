item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations founded in  compucom systems  inc  together with its subsidiaries compucom or the company is a leading provider of full life cycle information technology it solutions to large and medium sized organizations throughout the united states 
the company offers its clients a single source for procuring  deploying  managing and supporting complex computing environments 
through its comprehensive portfolio of service and product offerings  compucom helps clients reduce the costs  complexities  obstacles and risks associated with new technology adoption and acquisition  operational transition and on going management of their information systems 
compucom s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon compucom s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires compucom to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
compucom bases its estimates on historical experience and on other relevant assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies compucom s significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following are compucom s critical accounting policies  followed by a brief discussion of each allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition  intangible assets and goodwill  and income taxes allowance for doubtful accounts 
compucom s allowance for doubtful accounts relate to trade and vendor rebate receivables 
compucom generates trade receivables from product and service sales to its clients 
compucom generates vendor rebate receivables from its participation in certain manufacturers customer specific rebate programs 
under these programs  compucom is required to pay a higher initial amount for the product and then claim a rebate from the manufacturer to reduce the final cost 
these rebates are then passed on to the customer in the form of a reduced sales price 
the collection of these rebates can take an extended period of time 
due to these vendor rebate programs  compucom s initial cost of the product is often higher than the sales price compucom can obtain from its clients 
the amounts due from manufacturers under such customer specific rebate programs are recorded as a reduction to accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements summarizes the activity in these accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based on identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  the company specifically analyzes trade and vendor rebate receivables  and analyzes historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  changes in customer payment terms and the complexities of vendor mandated program requirements 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or vendors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize more of its receivables in the future than previously estimated  an adjustment to the allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary 
revenue recognition 
compucom derives revenue from primarily two sources product sales which consist of sales of technology products  including desktop  networking  storage  and mobile computing products  as well as peripherals and software related products and licenses and services which consist primarily of application design  development and maintenance  all aspects of desktop outsourcing  including field engineering  as well as help desk and lan wan network outsourcing  configuration  asset tracking  software management  mobile computing services  it consulting  training  staff augmentation  and services provided to support certain manufacturers direct fulfillment initiatives 
compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations compucom recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
generally for product sales  these criteria are met at the time of delivery to a common carrier 
the company generally uses either a binding purchase order or signed sales agreement as evidence of an arrangement and in determining whether the sales price is fixed and determinable 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from customers 
if  at the time of the sale  the company determines that collection of the sales price is not reasonably assured  the company defers the revenue and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
provision is made at the time the related revenue is recognized for estimated product returns  which historically have been immaterial 
the company analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand when evaluating the adequacy of provisions for sales returns 
revenue from the sale of software licenses is generally recorded on a gross basis when the software license is delivered to the customer and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
shipping and handling revenues are included in product revenues and costs are included in product costs 
compucom receives volume incentive dollars from certain vendors related to sales activity of certain products  which are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when it is reasonably certain as to the amount of the earned incentive 
these incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based  but can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
these amounts are recorded as receivables on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company s service revenue is primarily billed based on hourly rates  and the company recognizes revenue as these services are performed or ratably over the contract term 
revenue in excess of billings on service contracts is recorded as unbilled receivables 
billings in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts are recorded as deferred income until revenue recognition criteria are met 
intangible assets and goodwill 
compucom reviews its identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that compucom considers important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in its stock price for a sustained period  and compucom s market capitalization relative to net book value if compucom determines that the carrying value of identifiable intangibles may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company assesses the recoverability of the intangibles by determining whether the amortization of the asset balance over its remaining life can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flow of the acquired operations 
any impairment is measured based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment 
the impairment testing is performed at a reporting unit level 
the goodwill impairment testing has two steps 
the first step identifies potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired and the second step is not necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed to calculate the possible impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value  a write down is recorded 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined based on combinations of both the income and market valuation approaches 
compucom systems  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations income taxes 
compucom is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the company s actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that the company believes recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
compucom has not recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of recorded deferred tax assets representing future deductions  as the company believes it will have sufficient taxable income in the future to realize these deductions 
compucom considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event compucom were to determine that it would not be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made
