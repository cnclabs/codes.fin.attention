item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result s of operations critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission the sec issue d disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec define s critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the nee d to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain an d may change in subsequent periods 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in th e notes to consolidated financial statements included in part iv of this annua l report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies requir e management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates however  the following policies could be deemed to be critical within the se c definition 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized at the time the product is shipped with provisions established for estimated product returns 
upon shipment  th e company provides for the estimated cost that may be incurred for produc t warranties 
rebates and other sales incentives offered by customers are recorde d as a reduction of sales at the time of shipment 
revenue recognition i s significant because net sales is a key component of results of operations 
i n addition  revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such a s commissions and royalties 
the company follows generally accepted guidelines i n measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of it s revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall i n revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause operating results to var y significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operatin g losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trad e receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of thes e methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  the compan y evaluates specific accounts where it has information that the customer may hav e an inability to meet its financial obligations bankruptcy  etc in thes e cases  the company uses its judgment  based on the best available facts an d circumstances  and records a specific reserve for that customer against amount s due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional informatio n is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a general reserve i s established for all customers based on several factors  including historica l write offs as a percentage of sales and anticipated returns related to custome r receivables 
if circumstances change ie higher than expected defaults or a n unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet it s financial obligation  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amount s due could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories the company ensures inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  an d continually reviews the book value of discontinued product lines to determine i f these items are properly valued 
the company identifies these items and assesse s the ability to dispose of them at a price greater than cost 
if it is determine d that cost is less than market value  then cost is used for inventory valuation if market value is less than cost  then related inventory is set to that value page if a write down to the current market value is necessary  the market valu e cannot be greater than the net realizable value  defined as selling price les s costs to complete and dispose and cannot be lower than the net realizable valu e less a normal profit margin 
the company also continually evaluates th e composition of its inventory and identifies slow moving and excess inventories inventory items identified as slow moving or excess are evaluated to determin e if reserves are required 
if the company is not able to achieve its expectation s of the net realizable value of the inventory at current value  it would have t o adjust its reserves accordingly 
accounting for income taxes the company s income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects o f temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities an d amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well a s operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company follows generall y accepted guidelines regarding the recoverability of any tax assets recorded o n the balance sheet and provides any necessary allowances as required 
as part o f the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company i s required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which i t operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differin g treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these difference s result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within th e consolidated balance sheet 
management must then assess the likelihood tha t deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to th e extent it believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent it establishes a valuation allowance o r increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the ta x provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision fo r income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuatio n allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
as of december   th e company had recorded a valuation allowance of  due to uncertaintie s related to its ability to utilize some deferred tax assets  primarily consistin g of certain net operating loss carryforwards for state tax purposes  before the y expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income b y jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which deferre d tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ fro m these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  the compan y may need to establish an additional valuation allowance that could materiall y impact its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was  net of a valuation allowance of  the carrying value of the company s ne t deferred tax assets assumes that it will be able to generate sufficient futur e taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company ma y be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred ta x assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated statemen t of operations 
management evaluates the reliability of the deferred tax asset s quarterly  and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
legal contingencies the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
as discussed i n note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in par t iv to this annual report on form k  the company has accrued an estimate o f page the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has bee n developed after investigation and is based upon an analysis of potentia l results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies management does not believe these proceedings will have a material advers e effect on the company s consolidated financial position 
it is possible however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly o r annual period could be materially affected by changes in these assumptions  o r the effectiveness of these strategies  related to these proceedings 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets primarily consists of fixed assets  goodwill an d other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas requires that goodwill b e tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or on e level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests i n certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test require s judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets an d liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  an d determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgment s required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating futur e cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect th e determination of fair value for each reporting unit 
effective january   the company adopted sfas and performed a transitional test of its goodwill and intangible assets 
no impairment charge s were recorded as a result of the initial impairment test 
goodwill was als o tested for impairment in the fourth quarter  after the completion of the annua l budgeting and forecasting process 
due to  among other things  the overal l softening of the global economy and the related decline in operating results o f surftech  the company recorded a goodwill impairment loss of  the fai r value of the reporting unit giving rise to the transitional impairment loss wa s estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
any furthe r impairment losses recorded in the future could have a material adverse impact o n the company s financial conditions and results of operations 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of its long lived asset s held and used  other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and assets to be disposed of whenever events or circumstances indicate that th e carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company assesses th e recoverability of the asset 
it compares estimated cash flows  on a discounte d basis  expected to be generated from the related assets to the carrying amount s to determine whether impairment has occurred 
if the estimate of cash flow s expected to be generated changes in the future  the company may be required t o record impairment charges that were not previously recorded for these assets this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carryin g value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge i s recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asse t exceeds its fair value 
page environmental expenditures the company is subject to united states and mexican environmental laws an d regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges to surface an d subsurface waters  and generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatmen t and disposal of waste materials 
the company is also subject to other federal state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that requir e it to remediate or mitigate the effects of the disposal or release of certai n chemical substances at various sites  including some where the company ha s ceased operations 
it is impossible to predict precisely what effect these law s and regulations will have in the future 
expenditures that relate to current operations are charged to expense o r capitalized  as appropriate 
expenditures that relate to an existing conditio n caused by past operations  which do not contribute to future revenues  ar e generally expensed 
liabilities are recorded when remedial efforts are probabl e and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the liability for remediatio n expenditures includes  as appropriate  elements of costs such as sit e investigations  consultants fees  feasibility studies  outside contracto r expenses and monitoring expenses 
estimates are not discounted  nor are the y reduced by potential claims for recovery from insurance carriers 
the liabilit y is periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress prospective estimates of required activity and other relevant factors includin g changes in technology or regulations
