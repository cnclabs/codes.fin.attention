item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements 
where  in any forward looking statement  we express an expectation or belief as to future results or events  such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis  but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished 
the following include some but not all of the factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated interactive television is an emerging business and it may not attract widespread market acceptance or demand 
our success will depend upon  among other things  the broad acceptance of interactive television by industry participants  including operators of broadcast and pay television networks  cable and direct broadcast satellite system operators and manufacturers of televisions and set top boxes  as well as by television viewers and advertisers 
because the market for interactive television is emerging  the potential size of the market opportunity and the timing of its development are uncertain 
the growth and future success of our business will depend in part upon our ability to penetrate new markets and convince cable and direct broadcast satellite system operators  television viewers and advertisers to adopt and maintain their use of our products and services 
many key participants have not embraced interactive television  which is in its relative infancy  for a variety of reasons  including significant up front costs associated with implementing interactive television platforms  including costs associated with technology  marketing and professional services  the uncertain ability to generate meaningful returns from interactive television related investments  and inadequate transmission facilities and broadcast centers 
accordingly  such participants may continue to perceive interactive television as an unproven business proposition and be reluctant to participate 
if cable and direct broadcast satellite system operators determine that interactive television is not viable as a business proposition or if they determine that interactive television services are not consistent with their business or operational strategies  they may not choose  or may stop using  our products and services 
unfavorable economic conditions may continue to affect the business decisions of industry participants in a manner that adversely impacts our business  results of operations and future prospects 
worldwide economic growth has slowed significantly in recent periods and there is considerable uncertainty relating to the prospects for near term economic growth 
in addition  spending by participants in the interactive television industry has slowed significantly over this same time frame 
these factors significantly and adversely impacted our business and results of operations during the year ended december  although we cannot predict when conditions will improve for the interactive television industry  we expect that industry participants will continue to spend cautiously over at least the short term 
as a result  network operators may be less inclined to make capital investments in digital television infrastructure or place orders for our products  which may negatively impact our license and services and support revenues 
to the extent that i 
table of contents network operators reduce their rates of set top box deployment  our royalty revenues would be adversely impacted 
our professional services and support revenues may suffer to the extent that network operators slow down their selection of new applications and the design and installation of new interactive television services 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not harm our business  results of operations or future prospects  particularly as they might impact the business decisions of customers such as bskyb and motorola that have contributed significantly to our overall revenues during prior periods 
moreover  in the current economic climate  the large debt burdens  operating challenges and cash constraints of some of our customers may interfere with their ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
our bad debt expense might increase if customers go into bankruptcy or are otherwise unable to satisfy their payment obligations to us in full 
our core middleware has achieved significant market penetration and  accordingly  our ability to generate future revenues may be limited 
we have on a historic basis derived a substantial amount of our total revenues from royalties associated with the deployment of our core middleware and fees charged for services rendered in support of our middleware deployments 
because there are currently only a limited number of cable and direct broadcast satellite system operators worldwide that deploy interactive products and services  and because our core middleware has achieved significant penetration in the markets that have adopted interactive television on a large scale  it has become increasingly difficult for us to generate substantial additional core middleware related revenues 
these difficulties contributed to the substantial revenue decline we experienced during for the year ended december   our total revenues declined and our royalties attributable to the deployment of our middleware products declined  compared to our capacity to generate future revenues associated with our core middleware may be limited due to a number of reasons 
for example  network operators that have selected our core middleware may reduce their pace of set top box deployment or stop deploying set top boxes enabled with our core middleware altogether 
they may also decrease or stop their use of our support services  or choose not to upgrade or add additional features to the version of our core middleware running on their networks 
in addition  network operators that have not selected our core middleware in the limited number of markets that have adopted interactive television on a large scale may choose another middleware platform for the provision of interactive services  due to pre existing economic relationships between such network operators and other middleware providers or otherwise  or determine that interactive television is not part of their long term business strategies 
moreover  a meaningful opportunity to deploy our core middleware in the markets that have not yet adopted interactive television on a large scale may never develop or may develop at a very slow pace 
any of these eventualities would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may have difficulty generating substantial content and applications revenues in the future 
we hope that growth in our content and applications revenues will mitigate or reverse the effects of the core middleware related revenue declines on our overall revenues 
in the past  we have derived only a small portion of our total revenues from our content and applications offerings and may have difficulty generating substantial applications related revenues in the future 
because cable and direct broadcast satellite system operators control the marketing and distribution of our content and applications offerings  we cannot predict the amount of revenues that will be generated by those offerings  or whether such revenues will be sufficient to offset our costs of development 
moreover  due to the continuing global economic downturn  cable and direct broadcast satellite system operators may slow down their deployment of new content and applications offerings 
in addition  our content and applications offerings are subject to general risks related to consumer preferences  consumer preferences change rapidly and we may not be able to monitor  anticipate and successfully respond to these changes 
accordingly  our ability to generate substantial revenues from our content and applications offerings is uncertain 
i 
table of contents our restructuring initiatives may result in unanticipated consequences and may not be as successful in reducing expenses as we had anticipated 
as described in item business 
general development of the business recent developments  we began to implement various restructuring initiatives in in an effort to streamline our worldwide operations and reduce our operating expenses 
in this regard  we have undertaken and are continuing to undertake efforts to consolidate our operations  close various offices around the world  move our headquarters facilities from mountain view  california to san francisco  california and reduce our headcount by over across all areas of our business 
these initiatives may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and loss of employee morale and decreased performance 
in addition  the recent reduction or elimination of cash bonuses and other employee benefits may reduce incentives for employees to remain with us 
these reductions in personnel  both anticipated and unanticipated  could materially and adversely impact our sales and marketing efforts  our research and development efforts  and our professional services and our general and administrative functions 
in conjunction with these restructuring initiatives  we have engaged and are continuing to engage in a review of our operations with a view towards improving our business performance 
there is a risk that  as new business strategies and administrative processes are developed and implemented  the changes we adopt will be unduly disruptive or less effective than our old strategies and processes 
this may adversely affect our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we may be unable in the future to raise additional capital required to support our operating activities 
we expect that our capital resources  which included cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities of million at december   will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next twelve months 
nevertheless  we have incurred to date and expect that we will continue to incur in the future significant research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses  many of which result from non cancelable operating commitments 
we used approximately million in cash for operating activities during the fiscal year ended december  and we expect that cash used in operating activities for the year ending december  will be in the range of to million 
based on these levels of cash uses  we may need to raise additional capital in the future if we are unable to reduce substantially the amount of cash used in our operating activities 
while we are implementing various initiatives designed to reduce our operating expenses and bring them in line with our revenues  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so 
to the extent we are required to raise additional capital  we may not be able to do so at all or we may be able to do so only on unacceptable terms 
if we cannot raise additional capital on acceptable terms  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements  any of which could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations or future prospects 
if additional capital is raised through the issuance of equity securities or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing shareholders will be reduced and shareholders may experience dilution in net book value per share 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
we may have difficulty integrating the operations  products and personnel of acquired companies 
we expect our recent acquisition of wink communications to enhance our existing product offerings  research and development capabilities and ability to offer customers interactive television solutions across a wide range of technical platforms  and hope to achieve similar benefits through our proposed acquisition of actv 
nevertheless  we may have difficulty integrating the product lines  technologies  operations  financial systems and distinct corporate culture of wink communications 
we may face similar difficulties upon completion of the i 
table of contents proposed acquisition of actv 
if our integration efforts are not successful  we will not receive the benefits we expected from these acquisitions 
in addition  any difficulties arising during our integration efforts may impair relationships with employees and customers and distract us from operating our business 
any of these eventualities could have a negative effect on our business  results of operations and future prospects 
we depend upon key personnel to manage and operate our business  and we may be unable to attract or retain such personnel 
our business and success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain experienced management  technical  sales  marketing and financial personnel 
in  we began to implement various restructuring initiatives that have resulted in substantial reductions in personnel and significant turnover among key members of management 
if our new organization of senior management does not work well together  or if we have difficulties retaining remaining key non management personnel or replacing key non management personnel who leave our employment  our ability to manage day to day operations  develop and deliver new technologies  attract and retain customers  attract and retain other employees  and generate revenues could be materially and adversely affected 
our business also requires highly trained consulting and support personnel to assist customers with launch and deployment of our products 
in the future  we may need to increase our consulting and support staff to support new customers and the expanding needs of our existing customers 
notwithstanding the current economic climate  hiring consulting and support personnel has remained very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary technical skills and understanding of the interactive television market  and we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel in the past 
even if we invest significant resources in attempting to attract  train and retain these qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts  which may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
to achieve our business objectives  we may recruit and employ skilled technical professionals from other countries to work in the united states 
limitations imposed by federal immigration laws and the availability of visas could adversely affect our ability to attract necessary qualified personnel 
this also may have a negative effect on our business and results of operations 
the trend of consolidation among industry participants may adversely impact our business  results of operations and future prospects 
there has been a worldwide trend of consolidation in the cable and satellite industries  as evidenced in the united states by the combination of at t broadband with comcast corporation and in the european union by the acquisition of united pan europe communication s wizja network in poland by canal group and by the proposed combination transaction with via digital and canal group in spain 
we believe this trend is likely to continue due to economic and competitive concerns 
this trend may expand to include other companies involved with the interactive television industry 
while the full impact of this trend is uncertain at the present time  we will need to adapt to changing relationships with industry participants as companies consolidate 
if we are unable to successfully manage these changing relationships  our business and results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  we believe that prior to making any decisions to commit significant resources to interactive television in the near term  network operators are likely to assess the changing industry landscape  which may delay further proliferation of our products and services and thereby harm our future prospects 
the market for our products and services is subject to significant competition  which could adversely affect our business 
we face competition from a number of companies  including many that have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources and a better recognized brand name than we do 
current and potential competitors in one or more aspects of our business include interactive television technology companies  i 
table of contents companies developing interactive television content and entertainment  and  in the professional services area  third party system integrators and internal information technology staffs at our cable and direct broadcast satellite system operator customers 
if any of these competitors achieves significant market penetration or other significant success within the markets upon which we rely as a significant source of revenue  or in new markets that we may enter in the future  our ability to maintain market share and sustain our revenues may be materially and adversely affected 
for further information concerning our competition  see item business narrative description of business competition 
because much of our success and value lies in our ownership and use of our intellectual property  our failure to protect our intellectual property and develop new proprietary technology may negatively affect us 
our ability to conduct our business effectively is dependent in part upon the maintenance and protection of our intellectual property 
we rely on patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright law  as well as confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements  to establish and protect our rights in and to our technology 
we have typically entered into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants  customers  strategic partners and vendors  in an effort to control access to  and distribution of  our software  related documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our software and other proprietary information without authorization 
policing unauthorized use of our software and proprietary information is difficult 
the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our intellectual property and the agreements we enter into may not be enforceable in some instances 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries or  alternatively  such protection may be difficult to enforce 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of our intellectual property rights and the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could cause us to incur substantial costs and diversion of resources  which in turn could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property infringement claims may be asserted against us  which could have the effect of disrupting our business 
the emerging interactive television industry is highly litigious  particularly regarding claims of intellectual property infringement 
the defense of any such claims could cause us to incur significant costs and could result in the diversion of resources to the defense of any claims brought  which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
as a result of such infringement claims  a court could issue an injunction preventing us from distributing certain products  which could adversely affect our business 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license of a third party s intellectual property rights in order to avoid any litigation 
however  a license under such circumstances may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  many of our agreements with customers contain an indemnification obligation  which could be triggered in the event that a customer is named in an infringement suit involving their products or involving the customer s products or services that incorporate or use their products 
if it is determined that our products infringe any of the asserted claims in such a suit  we may be prevented from distributing certain of our products and we may incur significant indemnification liabilities that may not be covered by insurance  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
see item legal proceedings 
the adoption of incompatible standards by our industry and rapid technological advances could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive 
the migration of television from analog to digital transmission  the convergence of television  the internet  communications and other media  and other emerging trends are creating a dynamic and unpredictable i 
table of contents environment in which to operate 
our ability to anticipate trends and adapt to new technologies and evolving standards is critical to our success 
recent attempts to establish industry wide standards for interactive television software include an initiative by cable network operators in the united states to create a uniform platform for interactive television called open cable and an initiative by european television industry participants to create a platform called multimedia home platform 
the establishment of these standards or other similar standards could adversely affect the pricing of our products and services  significantly reduce the value of our intellectual property and the competitive advantage our proprietary technology provides  cause us to incur substantial expenditures to adapt our products or services to respond to these developments  or otherwise hurt our business  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to newly established standards 
any delay or failure on our part to respond quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our products and services obsolete or non competitive and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  we must stay abreast of cutting edge technological developments and evolving service offerings to remain competitive and increase the utility of our services  and we must be able to incorporate new technologies into our products in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully  and any failure to do so may adversely affect us 
government regulations may adversely affect our business 
the telecommunications  media  broadcast and cable television industries are subject to extensive regulation by governmental agencies 
these governmental agencies continue to oversee and adopt legislation and regulation over these industries  particularly in the areas of user privacy  consumer protection  the online distribution of content and the characteristics and quality of online products and services  which may affect our business  the development of our products  the decisions by market participants to adopt our products and services or the acceptance of interactive television by the marketplace in general 
in particular  governmental laws or regulations restricting or burdening the exchange of personally identifiable information could delay the implementation of interactive services or create liability for us or any other manufacturer of software that facilitates information exchange 
these governmental agencies may also seek to regulate interactive television directly 
future developments relating to any of these regulatory matters may adversely affect our business 
our multinational operations expose us to certain financial and operational risks 
we derive our revenues from  and have business activities in  a number of countries throughout the world 
this exposes us to a number of risks  such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements  export and import restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  currency fluctuations and devaluations  difficulties in staffing and managing offices as a result of  among other things  distance  language and cultural differences  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  political and economic instability  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
i 
table of contents our software products may contain errors  which could cause us to lose revenue and incur unexpected expenses 
software development is an inherently complex and subjective process  which frequently results in products that contain errors  as well as defective features and functions 
moreover  our technology is integrated into the products and services of our cable and direct broadcast satellite system operator customers 
accordingly  a defect  error or performance problem with our technology could cause the systems of our cable and direct broadcast satellite system operator customers to fail for a period of time 
any such failure could subject us to damage claims and claims for indemnification by our customers that may not be covered by insurance and result in severe customer relations problems and harm to our reputation

overview we are one of the world s leading interactive television companies 
we provide operating middleware  interactive content and applications  interactive advertising and games  content creation tools  professional support services and strategic consulting for digital television network operators 
during  reductions by cable and satellite providers in their capital spending and rollout of interactive television related products and similar reductions by other customers had a significant adverse effect on the interactive television market  and on our operations 
as more fully described below  we expect this trend to continue until economic conditions improve for interactive television participants 
we have made several acquisitions over the past three years  the effects of which impact the comparability of our operating results 
these acquisitions were our merger with spyglass  inc in july  our acquisition of cablesoft corporation in november  our acquisition of static holdings limited in july  and our acquisition of wink communications  inc in october we have earned significant revenues from customers who are also strategic investors in our business 
revenues from these strategic investors were as follows in millions mih limited and its affiliates motorola and general instrument echostar communications corp

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of opentv and all majority owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we made our best estimates and judgments  which are normally based on knowledge and experience with regards to past and current events and assumptions about future events  giving due consideration to materiality 
listed below are the accounting policies that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset  liability  revenue or expense being reported 
all of these accounting policies  estimates and assumptions  as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements  have been discussed with our audit committee 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from four primary sources i royalties  ii professional services  support and other  iii channel fees  and iv license fees 
these revenue categories are discussed below 
royalties 
we recognize royalties upon notification of set top box shipments from licensees 
for non refundable prepaid royalties  we recognize revenue upon delivery of software provided that all other requirements of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  are met 
professional services  support and other 
for contracts with multiple obligations eg maintenance and other services  and for which vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements exists  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by statement of position no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
generally we have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the maintenance element of software arrangements based on the renewal rates for maintenance in future years as specified in the contracts 
in such cases  we defer the maintenance revenue at the outset of the arrangement and recognize it ratably over the period  during which the maintenance is to be provided  which generally commences on the date the software is delivered 
payments for maintenance and support fees are generally made in advance and are non refundable 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the service element is determined based on the price charged when those services are sold separately 
for revenue allocated to consulting services and for consulting services sold separately  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
professional services revenues from software development contracts are recognized generally on the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on actual costs incurred to total estimated costs 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which estimated losses are determined 
revenues from professional services agreements which include software customization services and implementation support to customers  are recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the costs incurred relative to total estimated costs for fixed bid contracts or based on the hours incurred multiplied by the hourly rate for time and material engagements 
advertising revenues earned under the wink brand are recognized based upon response transactions generated by television viewers at the time the response data is routed to the customer 
channel fees 
under the static brand  premium rate telephony charges are derived as consumers interact with our playjam channel 
premium rate telephony charges are recorded as revenue upon notification from the telecommunications companies with the amount due to the service providers and network operators recorded as cost of services 
ii 
table of contents license fees 
in accordance with statement of position  we recognize product license revenue upon shipment if a signed contract exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally enter into arrangements with network operators whereby we license our application software to network operators in exchange for a percentage of the revenue they earn from their customers 
when we have delivered all of the software under the arrangement  we recognize the revenue as the network operator reports to us its revenue share  which is done generally on a quarterly basis 
under arrangements where the customer receives rights for unspecified future applications when they are made available  we recognize the revenue over the term of the arrangement 
for the wink engine software we recognize license revenue on a sell through basis based upon notification of set top box shipments from licensees 
we comply with the requirements of emerging issues task force eitf no 
which require that consideration  including equity instruments  given to a customer should be classified in the vendor s income statement as a reduction of revenue unless the consideration relates to a separable identifiable benefit received from the customer and the fair value of such benefit can be reasonably estimated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable 
our customer base is dispersed across many geographic areas and we generally do not require collateral 
we analyze  among other things  historic collection experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends in each country where our customers are located  and customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
significant management judgment is required in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in market or customer conditions could affect this evaluation 
valuation of investments in privately held companies we invest in equity and debt instruments of privately held companies for the promotion of business and strategic objectives  and typically we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks of these investments 
we perform periodic reviews of our investments for impairment 
our investments in privately held companies are considered impaired when a review of the investee s operations and other indicators of impairment indicate that there has been a decline in the fair value that is other than temporary and the carrying value of the investment is not likely to be recoverable 
such indicators include  but are not limited to  limited capital resources  need for additional financing  and prospects for liquidity of the related securities 
impaired investments in privately held companies are written down to estimated fair value  which is the amount we believe is recoverable from our investment 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which was followed through december   amortization was computed on the straight line basis over the estimated benefit periods and long lived assets were reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge against goodwill of million as a result of future cash flow projections being insufficient to demonstrate recoverability of the carrying value of our fixed and intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever there are indicators that such assets may be impaired 
separable intangible ii 
table of contents assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the adoption of sfas as of january   resulted in a transitional impairment charge for goodwill of million  which was recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of in addition  we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the third quarter of we account for long lived assets under sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires us to review for impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
when such an event occurs  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the asset s fair value and its carrying value 
sfas superseded sfas restructurings we monitor our organizational structure and associated operating expenses periodically 
depending upon events and circumstances  actions may be taken to restructure the business  including terminating employees  abandoning excess lease space and incurring other exit costs 
restructuring costs are recorded in accordance with eitf no 
 liability recognition of certain employee termination benefits and other costs incurred in a restructuring 
any resulting restructuring accrual includes numerous estimates made by management  which are developed based on management s knowledge of the activity being affected and the cost to exit existing commitments 
these estimates could differ from actual results 
we monitor the initial estimates periodically and record an adjustment for any significant changes in estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf relates to sfas s timing for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows  except that it may impact the timing of recognition of exit costs 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal and such adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the recognition provisions of fin  but expect that they will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows upon adoption 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for share based employee compensation 
we have elected to continue to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to ii 
table of contents employees  in accounting for our share based compensation plans 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decision with respect to share based employee compensation  and requires disclosure about those effects in both annual and interim financial statements 
these disclosure provisions are effective for our fiscal year ended december  in january  the eitf published eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which requires companies to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet certain criteria 
arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into for fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this issue will have on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
years ended december    and revenues revenues for the year ended december  declined by million  or  from million in to million in revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from million in to million in revenues by line item were as follows in millions year ended december  royalties services  support and other channel fees license fees total revenues royalties 
we derive royalties from the sale of set top boxes that incorporate our software to manufacturers and network operators around the world 
royalty revenues are dependent on continued deployment of set top boxes by existing customers  upgrades to newer versions of our software by existing customers and new customers launching our technologies in their systems 
should set top box deployments and software upgrades by existing customers slow or the acquisition of new customers not occur  our royalty revenues would be negatively impacted in future years 
as there are a limited number of network operators capable of deploying interactive television on a large scale basis  we expect that our ability to achieve incremental royalty revenues will diminish in future years 
we recognize royalties upon notification of unit shipments from set top box manufacturers or network operators 
royalty reports are generally received one quarter in arrears 
for non refundable prepaid royalties we recognize revenues upon delivery of the software 
cumulative set top box deployments increased from million as of december  to million as of december  and to million as of december  the shipments reported and the revenues recognized during these periods were as follows year ended december  shipments in units royalties million million million million million million ii

in  the comparative royalties for have been reduced from million to million due to the reclassification of a one time payment of million for marketing the bskyb hard drive set top box 
royalties for the year ended december  declined by million  or  from million in to million in beginning in  we experienced a significant decline in the number of shipments of set top boxes enabled with our middleware 
the decline was especially acute in europe  where unit volume declined in compared to total royalty revenues in europe were million in compared to million after the application of eitf in and in asia pacific royalty revenues were million in compared to million in in the americas total royalty revenues were million in compared to million in  due primarily to increased shipments by echostar  offset by declines in the flash downloads of software by two other major customers 
royalties for the year ended december  increased by million  or  from million in to million in during the year ended december   we began providing middleware with enhanced features 
for the year ended december   royalties associated with set top boxes enabled with our enhanced middleware were million  of which million represented prepaid royalties 
royalties associated with set top boxes enabled with previous versions of our middleware decreased by million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  and in there was a reduction of million relating to the reclassification of the one time marketing payment for the bskyb hard drive set top box as a result of the application of eitf royalties attributable to bskyb decreased by million  including the reduction of million from the application of eitf during the year  royalties attributable to echostar increased by million and royalties attributable to other customers decreased by million 
royalties from set top boxes with enhanced middleware features accounted for of total royalties in compared with of total royalties in five of our customers sell set top boxes to bskyb  which accounted for million  or  of royalties in  million  due to the adoption of eitf  in and million  or  in the decline between and was due to a lower unit volume and a decrease in unit pricing due to volume discounts 
the decline in unit volume continued in our former controlling shareholder  mih limited  through its subsidiaries  purchased set top boxes from two of our customers 
effective april   all royalties were paid directly to us by the mih entities 
mih entities  directly and indirectly  accounted for zero royalties in  million in and million in unit shipments by echostar were million units in  million units in and million units in since echostar has a right to receive unspecified future applications when they are made available  the royalty revenue is being amortized over the seven year term of the agreements 
as such  the royalties recognized from echostar were million in  million in and million in services  support and other 
services  support and other revenue consist primarily of professional services consulting engagements for set top box manufacturers  network operators and system integrators and maintenance  support and training for set top box manufacturers and network operators 
as a result of a general slowdown in interactive television related spending by our customers in  revenues in this category declined by million  or  from million in to million in we expect that service  support and other revenues will continue to be negatively impacted by the general slowdown in spending in services  support and other revenues for the year ended december  increased by million from million in to million in professional services accounted for million of the increase due to the inclusion of the results of spyglass  which was acquired in  for the full year in compared ii

one of our strategic investors  general instrument corporation  and its parent company  motorola inc  accounted for million in services  support and other revenue in  million in and million in in november  we entered into a seven year services agreement whereby motorola guaranteed a minimum level of business over the first four years of the agreement 
it is the intent of the agreement that motorola or their referred customers would purchase products from us or contract services with us up to at least the minimum guaranteed level of business through december  motorola may terminate the agreement on sixty days notice at any time after january   but will remain responsible to us for the minimum guaranteed level of business for in the event it terminates the agreement prior to december  mih limited and its related entities accounted for million of services  support and other revenue in  million in and million in echostar accounted for million of services  support and other revenue in  million in and million in channel fees

we receive revenue primarily from premium rate telephone calls that are placed by consumers  using the telephone or the remote control  for membership registration  game score registration for the chance to win prizes  and for access to pay per play content 
following the development of new and more popular games and the introduction of an interactive payment mechanism  channel fees experienced strong growth in total revenues were million for the year ended december   compared with million for the last six months of license fees 
we derive license fees from the sale of products such as device mosaic  opentv streamer  opentv software developers kit and various applications  including opentv publisher 
these fees can vary greatly from quarter to quarter depending on whether any large size agreements occur 
due to the general slowdown in interactive television related spending by our customers  we experienced a significant decline in license fees in license fees for the year ended december  declined by million  or  from million in to million in opentv streamer license fees accounted for approximately one third of the total in both years 
license fees for the year ended december  decreased by million from million in to million in sales of products  including opentv streamer and new applications such as opentv publisher  offset a decrease in device mosaic sales in as compared to motorola accounted for zero license fees in  million in and million in mih and its related entities accounted for million of license fees in  million in and million in echostar accounted for zero license fees in  million in and million in operating expenses our total operating expenses decreased by million from  million in to million in our total operating expenses increased by  million from million in to  million in the results for include the results of wink communications for four months and the results of static for the full twelve months compared with only six months for static in the results for include six months of static and twelve months of spyglass compared with only five months of spyglass in ii

general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million from million in to million in due primarily to the inclusion of four months of operating results of wink communications  which accounted for million of the increase  and an increase of million resulting from the inclusion of static s operating results for a full year in in addition  the results include million for retention payments to certain key management personnel with no comparable expense in and an increase of million in the provision for doubtful accounts in as compared to these increases were offset by a decrease of million due to lower share based compensation for certain options which were cancelled or became fully vested and lower bonus compensation

restructuring costs 
during we took several initiatives to reduce operating expenses around the world 
these initiatives resulted in total restructuring costs of million 
in the first quarter we recorded a restructuring provision of million for the termination of approximately employees in offices in the united states and korea and the write down of assets and excess facilities in the united states  france and korea 
in the third quarter we recorded a restructuring provision of million which included million for the termination of approximately employees in the naperville  illinois office and the write down of assets and excess facilities  partially offset by a credit of million for a favorable lease settlement in france 
in the fourth quarter we recorded a restructuring provision of million for the termination of approximately employees in offices in the united states and other countries and the write down of assets and excess facilities 
an additional restructuring provision will be recorded in the first quarter of when the staff and office space in france is reduced significantly 
there were no restructuring charges in or impairment and amortization of goodwill and intangible assets 
at december   we recorded an impairment of million against the carrying value of goodwill as a result of our cash flow projections which indicated that the future cash flows were not sufficient to result in the recovery of the carrying value of our fixed and intangible assets 
in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we reevaluated the amount recorded as goodwill as of january  and determined that a transitional impairment of million had occurred 
this amount has been shown as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the third quarter of  due to reductions by cable and satellite providers in their capital spending and rollout of interactive television related products and similar reductions by other customers  we revised our cash flow projections for the remainder of calendar year and future years 
based on these cash flow projections and other factors  including the decline in the market price of our class a ordinary shares  we determined that the remaining goodwill was impaired  and accordingly  wrote off the balance of million 
as a result of the new accounting rules for goodwill  there was no amortization required in  whereas the amortization of goodwill was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  in the third quarter of  due to the shift in strategic direction resulting from the change in our controlling shareholder  we determined that an impairment of million had occurred in the value of the patents related to our openstar joint venture with echostar due to the absence of any current or future expected cash flow generated by the joint venture 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated benefit periods of to years 
amortization of developed technologies was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these amounts have been included in the consolidated statements of operations as cost of revenues 
amortization of other intangible assets was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in amortization expense from to was due primarily to the impairment of the patents related to the openstar joint venture and certain spyglass intangibles which had an amortization period of years becoming fully amortized 
amortization for the year ended december  increased by million compared to due to a full year of amortization for spyglass and cablesoft plus the intangibles associated with the acquisition of static

table of contents interest income as a result of declining interest rates in the united states coupled with decreases in our investment portfolio resulting from the sale of investment securities both to support our operations and to finance our acquisition of wink communications  interest income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  as a result of our initial public offering in november  interest income from our investment portfolio was million for the year ended december  the value of our investment portfolio decreased in  largely due to working capital needs  capital expenditures  and cash paid in connection with our acquisition of static  and the average interest rate on the portfolio also decreased 
this resulted in a decline in interest income of million to million for the year ended december  other income and expense items during the past three years  we made various equity investments in  and loans to  certain privately held companies 
most of these companies subsequently experienced severe cash flow problems and we found it necessary to write down the value of our private equity investments and notes receivable 
for the year ended december   we wrote down million of such private equity investments and notes receivables and our share of losses of private equity investee was million 
for the year ended december  there was a write down of private equity investments and notes receivable of million 
during the year ended december   two investments were determined to have no value and an impairment loss of million was recorded 
as a result of the acquisition of spyglass in july  we acquired certain marketable equity securities that were valued at million 
these securities were sold for realized losses of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  minority interest in november  we established spyglass integration  a co owned venture with motorola 
due to the losses of this venture  we recorded minority interest income of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and a nominal amount for the year ended december  income taxes we have significant united states federal tax loss carryforwards 
however  we are subject to income taxes in certain state and foreign jurisdictions and we have foreign taxes withheld from certain royalty payments 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  there was a net income tax benefit of million  which was comprised of a current tax provision of million offset by a deferred tax credit of million resulting from the fair value calculations for the aforementioned marketable equity securities acquired in connection with our acquisition of spyglass and which were subsequently sold 
there was a net income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we invest a portion of our cash in debt instruments that are highly liquid  high quality investment grade securities and that predominantly have maturities of less than two years 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which was a decrease of million from the prior year 
cash and cash equivalents as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
taking into ii 
table of contents account short term and long term marketable debt securities of million  our cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were million as of december  compared to million as of december  and million as of december   computed on a similar basis 
cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for and million for the increases in cash uses were due primarily to our continuing operating losses 
cash provided from investing activities was million for the year ended december   primarily due to the sale of short term and long term marketable debt securities to finance the acquisition of wink communications coupled with cash acquired as part of the acquisition of wink  offset by the acquisition of wink for million and million for capital expenditures

this amount included million of cash received as part of the acquisition of spyglass  million from the sale of marketable equity securities and million net from a decrease in marketable debt securities and other items  which was offset by million of capital expenditures 
cash provided from financing activities was million for the year ended december   due to proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares and a capital contribution from the former controlling shareholder  mih limited 
cash provided from financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  these amounts were primarily from the exercise of warrants and stock options and issuance of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
as a result of the restructuring initiatives which were announced in september and october  we expect that upon completion  which is targeted by the end of the first quarter of  cash used in operations can be reduced by a significant amount in future periods 
however  as a result of restructuring payments required in and the acquisition of wink communications in late  it is expected that the cash used in operating activities for the year ending december  will be in the range of to million  similar to the last two years 
our future capital requirements will depend on a variety of factors  including market acceptance of interactive television  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  and other factors 
pursuant to exchangeable share arrangements under our exchange plan    and  shares of opentv  inc common stock were converted into our class a ordinary shares for the years ended december   and  respectively

the lease provides for an initial nominal rent period with total aggregate lease payments of million plus operating expenses over the seven year term of the lease 
other commitments in the ordinary course of business we and certain of our subsidiaries enter into various arrangements with vendors and other business partners for marketing  minimum revenue guarantees  bandwidth  consulting and other services 
minimum commitments under these arrangements as of december  were million for the year ending december   million for the year ending december  and million for the year ending december  at december   we had two standby letters of credit aggregating approximately million that were issued to landlords at two of our leased properties and million of marketable debt securities pledged with a bank for foreign exchange facilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks 
this exposure relates to our holdings of fixed income investment securities  investments in privately held companies and assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fixed income investment risk we own a fixed income investment portfolio with various holdings  types and maturities 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  included as a separate component of the balance sheet line item titled accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
ii 
table of contents most of these investments consist of a diversified portfolio of highly liquid united states dollar denominated debt securities classified by maturity as cash equivalents  short term investments or long term investments 
these debt securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
our investment policy limits the maximum maturity of securities in this portfolio to three years and weighted average maturity to months 
although we expect that market value fluctuations of our investments in short term debt obligations will not be significant  a sharp rise in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
alternatively  a sharp decline in interest rates could have a material positive effect on the value of securities with longer maturities in the portfolio 
we do not currently hedge interest rate exposures 
our investment policy limits investment concentration in any one issuer other than with respect to united states treasury and agency securities and also restricts this part of our portfolio to investment grade obligations based on the assessments of rating agencies 
there have been instances in the past where the assessments of rating agencies have failed to anticipate significant defaults by issuers 
it is possible that we could lose most or all of the value in an individual debt obligation as a result of a default 
a loss through a default may have a material impact on our earnings even though our policy limits investments in the obligations of a single issuer to no more than five percent of the value of our portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values in our portfolio of investment securities with original maturities greater than days as of december  using a model that assumes immediate sustained parallel changes in interest rates across the range of maturities in thousands issuer valuation of securities if interest rates decrease fair value as of valuation of securities if interest rates increase valuation of securities if interest rates increase united states government and agencies state and local governments in the united states corporate notes and bonds non united states government certificate of deposit total the modeling technique used in the above table estimates fair values based on changes in interest rates assuming static maturities 
the fair value of individual securities in our investment portfolio is likely to be affected by other factors including changes in ratings  market perception of the financial strength of the issuer of such securities and the relative attractiveness of other investments 
accordingly  the fair value of our individual securities could also vary significantly in the future from the amounts indicated above 
private investment risk we have historically invested in equity securities and debt obligations of certain privately held companies that are in the start up or development stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies  products and services these companies have under development may never materialize  and we could incur the loss of a portion or all of our investments in these privately held companies 
during the calendar year  we wrote down the value of such investments by million 
as of december  all of these investments had been written down to a carrying value of zero 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our functional currencies are generally the local currencies of the countries in which we have business units 
we incur a substantial majority of our expenses  and ii 
table of contents earn most of our revenues  in united states dollars 
we have a foreign currency exchange exposure management policy 
the policy permits the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts and the use of other hedging procedures in connection with hedging foreign currency exposures 
the policy requires that the use of derivatives and other procedures qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we regularly assess foreign currency exchange rate risk that results from our global operations 
we used foreign currency forward exchange contracts in hedging foreign currency exposures during the calendar year ended december  the outstanding balance of commitments under foreign exchange forward contracts did not exceed million at any time during the year ended december  there were no foreign exchange forward contracts or other procedures implemented to hedge foreign currency exposures outstanding as of december
