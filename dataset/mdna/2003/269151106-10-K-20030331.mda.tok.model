industry background from large screen televisions to vcrs to multi featured dvd players  technology continues to improve the home entertainment experience 
technology advancements have enhanced the clarity  color  sound  functionality and convenience of television home entertainment 
in particular  the transition from analog to digital formats has allowed audio and video data to be compressed with little or no perceptible audio and 
table of contents image degradation  improving storage and transmission efficiency 
digital formats provide users with several benefits  including random access to data  superior editing capabilities and enhanced security features such as protection against unauthorized copying 
the development of digital media has created markets for new products such as vcd  dvd and multi featured dvd  dvr and recordable dvd players 
as digital processing and transmission technology improves  we believe additional home entertainment products will continue to be introduced 
some of the more significant digital home entertainment products include dvd players 
dvd players provide significantly higher quality playback than is possible with vcr or vcd technology through the use of mpeg video decoding and high quality digital audio technologies 
video cd players 
vcd players are music cd players that have been modified to display video on a television and typically sell for less than a low end vcr 
vcd offers quality comparable to vcrs  but is limited to approximately minutes of video information  using an mpeg format standard for compression 
the vcd market is divided into the standard vcd market  and the subsequently developed super vcd svcd market 
vcd is popular in many developing countries while svcd is almost exclusively sold in china 
we are currently the leading supplier of vcd processor chips 
digital set top boxes stbs 
digital stbs enable subscriber based digital television through cable  terrestrial broadcast  digital subscriber line  or dsl  and satellite transmissions 
we are developing a system controller chip for the stb market 
digital video recorders dvrs 
dvrs provide local hard disk storage similar to a vcr and enable storage and playback of live video streams on a real time basis 
dvrs can be in the form of standalone players or be incorporated into digital stbs to enhance their functionality 
we expect to begin supplying dvr encoder chips to our customers in recordable dvd players 
recordable dvd players add high quality video and audio recording capabilities to the dvd disc 
we expect to begin supplying recordable dvd encoder chips to our customers in consumer digital audio players 
consumer digital audio players include multi channel surround sound products with movie theater quality sound systems 
our chips incorporate this digital audio processor as components of a home entertainment system 
the television  the telephone and the personal computer pc have emerged as the three principal home systems that manage digital entertainment and information 
the television and the pc are the principal devices for viewing and manipulating digital content 
stbs  dvd players and game consoles connected to televisions  are emerging as the principal platforms for viewing home entertainment  while pcs remain the principle platform for storing data and accessing the internet 
increasing advances in semiconductor technology are allowing digital products to converge  resulting in cost savings and added convenience for consumers 
for example  cd players were initially developed to play audio content in the cd format only 
then  dvd players were introduced  combining video with the cd audio format 
now  additional audio formats  such as mp  and other features are being added 
consumers can currently buy separate stbs that provide internet connectivity  separate dvrs as well as boxes that deliver digital programming 
in the future  all of these features and functions may become available through a single dvd platform 
at the same time  advances in communication devices allow better distribution of information and home entertainment content to the home and within the home  and provide opportunities for further development of multimedia products 
as digital home entertainment systems converge and become increasingly complex  makers of these systems increasingly require sophisticated semiconductor chips that are multi featured  adaptable and cost effective

by supporting standard operating systems  we can leverage third party software applications  such as standard web browsers  and third party software drivers to support printers  digital cameras and other consumer electronics products 

table of contents we must continually design  develop and introduce new products that take advantage of market opportunities and address emerging technical standards 
we intend to leverage our base of design expertise  analog  digital and mixed signal design capabilities and process technologies  and software and systems expertise to continue to develop audio  video and communication solutions for the consumer electronics marketplace 
our design environment is based on workstations  dedicated product simulators  system simulation with hardware and software modeling  and a high level  design description language 
we invest regularly in new advanced equipment and software tools and we intend to maintain and enhance our library of core cells 
on research and development activities  we incurred approximately million during  million during  million during  excluding a one time charge of million related to purchased in process research and development from the acquisition of netridium communications  inc in the first quarter of customers we sell our chips to distributors and oems of dvd  vcd  mp  modem and pc products 
our customers manufacture and sell these products both as contract manufacturers for well known brand labels and under their own brands 
as a result  our chips can be found in a diverse array of dvd  vcd and pc products on store shelves in the united states  asia and europe 
for example  our chips can be found in certain branded dvd players  such as those sold by rca and philips 
a substantial portion of our net revenues has been derived from sales to a small number of our customers 
sales to our top five end customers including end customers that buy our products from our distributor dynax electronics hk ltd dynax electronics accounted for approximately of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in one of our top end customers  digital av formerly shinco accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues for  and  respectively 
sales and distribution we market our products worldwide through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
we have sales and support offices in the united states  china  hong kong  taiwan  japan and korea 
we believe customer service and technical support are important competitive factors in selling to major customers 
sales representatives and distributors supplement our efforts by providing additional customer service at the local level 
we believe close contact with our customers not only improves the customer s level of satisfaction  but also provides important insight into future market direction 
international sales comprised approximately of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in our international revenues in  and were derived primarily from asian customers who manufacture dvd  vcd  communications and pc audio products 
companies in asia manufacture a large percentage of the worldwide supply of these products 
we believe a significant portion of our dvd chip products are incorporated into dvd players that are ultimately sold into the united states 
we have direct sales personnel and technical staff located in china  hong kong  taiwan  japan and korea where significant portions of our sales have historically been derived 
our products are also sold internationally through distributors and sales representatives located in hong kong  korea  singapore  and japan 
for fiscal  net sales to customers in each region as a percentage of our total net sales were hong kong  china  taiwan  korea  singapore  europe and japan 
our business is usually seasonal due to the christmas holiday season in america and europe  and the chinese new year season in china and asia 
our sales representatives and distributors are not subject to minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  certain of our distributors have rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes 
we rely on one of our distributors dynax electronics for a significant portion of our revenues  sales through dynax electronics were approximately  and of our net revenues in  and 
table of contents  respectively 
dynax electronics is not subject to any minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  dynax electronics has rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes  therefore we do not recognize revenue until dynax electronics sells through to our end customers 
manufacturing we contract with third parties for all of our fabrication and assembly as well as the majority of our test operations 
this manufacturing strategy enables us to focus on our design and development strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing capabilities 
semiconductor manufacturing consists of foundry activity where wafer fabrication takes place  as well as chip assembly and testing activities 
we use several independent foundries that use advanced manufacturing technologies to fabricate our chips 
substantially all of our products are manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc  which has manufactured products for us since  united microelectronics corporation umc  which is also located in taiwan  and other independent asian foundries 
most of our products are currently fabricated using both mixed signal and logic cmos to micron process technologies 
manufacturing requires raw materials and a variety of components to be manufactured to our specifications 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers to obtain adequate supplies of quality raw materials on a timely basis 
we do not generally have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers  and we depend on foundries such as tsmc  umc and others for foundry capacity to produce products of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yields in a timely manner 
as of december   we believe we have sufficient foundry capacity to meet our forecasted needs for the next months 
after wafer fabrication by the foundry  all of our semiconductor products are assembled and tested by third party vendors  primarily advanced semiconductor engineering  orient semiconductor electronics and sampo semiconductor in taiwan 
we have internally designed and developed our own test software and certain test equipment  which are provided to our test vendors 
see factors that may affect future results our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
competition our markets are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  price reductions and rapid product obsolescence 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  where the customer evaluates alternative design approaches that require integrated circuits 
because of shortened product life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
we expect competition to remain intense from existing competitors and from companies that may enter our existing or future markets 
in general  product prices in the semiconductor industry have decreased over the life of a particular product 
the markets for most of the applications for our products are characterized by intense price competition 
as the markets for our products mature and competition increases  we anticipate that prices for our products will continue to decline 
our existing and potential competitors consist of medium and large domestic and international companies  many of whom have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater intellectual property rights  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
our competitors also include a number of smaller and emerging companies 
our principal competitors in the dvd market include mediatek  zoran  sony  panasonic  stmicroelectronic  lsi logic  and cirrus logic 
mediatek has taken away some of our market share by launching a soc dvd chip product into our targeted low end dvd player market 
in addition  we expect that the dvd platform for the dhs will face competition from other platforms including stbs  as well as multi function game boxes 
some of our competitors may supply chips for multiple platforms  such as lsi logic and stmicroelectronics  each of which makes chips for both dvd players and stbs 
we also face strong competition from a competitor in the vcd market 

table of contents many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories as well as greater name recognition than we have 
any of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements and to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
in addition  as the market for the dhs develops  a number of companies with significantly greater resources than us could attempt to increase their presence in the market by acquiring or forming strategic alliances with our competitors resulting in increased competition to us 
in the past years  lsi logic acquired c cube microsystems  cirrus logic acquired luxsonor semiconductors  and oak technology acquired teralogic 
proprietary technology we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures to protect our intellectual property rights 
as of december   we had patents granted in the united states  which are going to expire over time commencing in and ending in in addition  as of december  we had corresponding foreign patents  which are going to expire over time commencing in and ending in we have several patent applications pending and intend to seek further us and international patents on our technology whenever possible 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions  which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation 
as of december   there was one intellectual property litigation matter pending against us which we are vigorously defending and believe will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we filed a complaint against mediatek incorporated  alleging copyright infringement and unfair competition 
see item  legal proceedings 
we currently license certain of the technology we use in our products  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
we have  in the past  granted limited licenses to certain of our technology  some of which have expired 
we have not derived material revenues from these licenses in recent periods 
see factors that may affect future results we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use and we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
employees as of december   we had approximately full time employees  including in research and development  in marketing  sales and support  in operations  finance and administration and in manufacturing 
over of our employees are engineers  and a significant number of them are software engineers 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified technical and management personnel  particularly highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software engineers involved in new product development  for whom competition can be intense  particularly in the silicon valley 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
backlog our products are generally sold pursuant to standard purchase orders  which are frequently revised to reflect changes in the customer s requirements 
product deliveries are scheduled when we receive purchase orders 
generally  these purchase orders allow customers to reschedule delivery dates and cancel purchase orders without significant penalties 
for these reasons  we believe that our backlog  while useful for scheduling production  is not necessarily a reliable indicator of revenues 
delays in delivery schedules and or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

item legal proceedings on march   we filed a complaint in the us district court for the northern district of california case no 
c against brent townshend  alleging unfair competition and patent misuse 
the complaint seeks specific performance of contractual obligations and declarations of patent misuse  unenforceability  and estoppels against asserting patent rights 
all of the claims relate to the refusal of mr 
townshend to provide us with a license on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms  as is required by applicable law 
the patents relate to the manufacture and sale of high speed modems 
on april   we filed an amended complaint 
on september   townshend filed an answer and counterclaims  alleging patent infringement 
we filed our answer to the counterclaims on october   and no trial date has yet been set 
townshend also filed patent infringement actions against agere  analog devices  cisco  and intel  alleging infringement of the same patents 
both townshend and ess filed statements indicating that the new cases are related to our case 
the parties are currently scheduled to hold a case management conference on april   after which initial discovery will begin 
we will vigorously pursue this litigation 
on september   we filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california case no 
c against mediatek incorporated  a taiwanese company mediatek  alleging copyright infringement and unfair competition 
the complaint seeks damages and an injunction barring importation into the united states of certain mediatek semiconductor chips alleged to infringe our proprietary intellectual property as well as all downstream products  specifically dvd players  incorporating such mediatek chips 
we believe that mediatek unlawfully acquired and copied our proprietary source code and graphical user interface relating to its dvd products  and then used that technology to target our customers and market mediatek s chips in unfair competition 
simultaneous with the complaint  we filed a motion for expedited discovery to force mediatek to turn over the suspected infringing code for expert analysis in support of a temporary restraining order 
mediatek s source code was produced at the end of december on february   mediatek answered the complaint  asserting affirmative defenses and counterclaims for a declaratory judgment of non infringement and for trade secret misappropriation 
on march   we filed a motion for preliminary injunction against mediatek s manufacture  distribution  and importation of dvd chips  or in the alternative  for an expedited trial on our copyright claims 
we also seek a recall order requiring mediatek to recall all dvd chips from its customers  distributors  retailers  and end users 
we are vigorously pursuing this litigation

overview we are a leading designer  developer and marketer of highly integrated digital processor chips 
these chips are the primary processors driving digital video and audio players  including dvd  video cd vcd and digital media players 
our chips use multiple processors and a programmable architecture that enable us to offer a broad array of features and functionality 
our products also include an encoding processor to address the growing demand for the digital video recorder dvr and recordable dvd players 
we believe that multi featured dvd  dvr and recordable dvd players will serve as a platform for the digital home system dhs  integrating various digital home entertainment and information delivery products into a single box 
we are also a supplier of chips for use in modems  consumer digital audio and pc audio products 
we outsource all of our chip fabrication and assembly as well as the majority of our test operations  allowing us to focus on our design and development strengths 
we market our products worldwide through our direct sales force  distributors and sales representatives 
substantially all of our sales are to customers in hong kong  china  taiwan  korea  singapore  and japan 
we employ sales and support personnel located outside of the united states in china  hong kong  taiwan  japan and korea to support these international sales efforts 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue 
in addition  substantially all of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by independent third parties in asia 
we also have a limited number of employees engaged in research and development efforts outside of the united states 
there are special risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states 
see factors that may affect future results we have significant international sales and operations that are subject to the special risks of doing business outside the united states 
ess was incorporated in california in and became a public company in in april  we expanded our business beyond the semiconductor segment by establishing vialta  a subsidiary that would operate in the internet segment 
in april  our board of directors adopted a plan to distribute to our shareholders all of our shares of vialta 
the vialta spin off was completed on august  critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets 
table of contents and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition inventories and inventory reserves goodwill and other intangible assets impairment of long lived assets income taxes and tax reserves legal contingencies in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also cases in which management s judgment is required in selecting appropriate accounting treatment among available alternatives under gaap 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
revenue recognition revenue is primarily generated by product sales and is generally recognized at the time of shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  except for products sold to certain distributors with certain rights of return and allowance  in which case  revenue is deferred until such distributor resells the products to a third party 
such deferred revenues related to distributor sales  net of deferred cost of goods sold are included in accrued expenses on our balance sheets 
we provide for rebates based on current contractual terms and future returns based on historical experiences at the time revenue is recognized as reductions to product revenue 
actual amounts may be different from management s estimates 
such differences  if any  are recorded in the period they become known 
inventory and inventory reserves our inventory is comprised of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  all of which are manufactured by third party contractors 
inventory is valued at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated slow moving  excess  obsolete  damaged or otherwise unmarketable products by an amount that is the difference between cost and estimated market value based on forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
we evaluate excess or obsolete inventory primarily by estimating demand for individual products within specific time horizons  typically one year or less 
we generally provide a reserve for the cost of products with on hand and committed quantities in excess of the estimated demand after considering factors such as product life cycles 
once established  reserves for excess or obsolete inventory are only released when the reserved products are scrapped or sold 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory at the lower of standard cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are based on the difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is the forecasted selling price of the product less the estimated costs of completion and disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 

table of contents the estimates of future demand  forecasted sales prices and market conditions used in the valuation of inventory form the basis for our published and internal revenue forecast 
if actual results are substantially lower than the forecast  we may be required to record additional write downs of product inventory in future periods and this may have a negative impact on gross margins 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which addresses the accounting that must be applied to goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
sfas requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually 
we have goodwill and other intangible assets related to our previous acquisitions of netridium and sas 
in accordance with sfas  we reclassified acquired workforce intangible assets  which were previously recognized apart from goodwill  as goodwill and ceased amortization of goodwill as of january  this change in accounting treatment reduced operating expenses by  during twelve months ended december  from levels 
in addition to goodwill associated with netridium and sas  we recorded goodwill amortization of approximately  and  for the fiscal years ended december  and december  respectively  associated with the acquisition of platform technologies  inc platform 
goodwill associated with the acquisition of platform technology was fully amortized in the provisions of sfas also require us to complete a transitional impairment test of goodwill within six months of adoption 
we completed our transitional impairment test of goodwill as of january   the adoption date of sfas and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in addition  we completed an annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
impairment of long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we review the recoverability of our long lived assets based upon our estimates of the future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the long lived assets and will reserve for impairment whenever such estimated future cash flows indicate the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
the adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
income taxes and tax reserves we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
us deferred income taxes are not provided on all un remitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as such earnings are considered permanently invested 
assumptions underlying recognition of deferred tax assets and non recognition of us income tax on un remitted earnings can change if our business plan is not achieved or if congress adopts changes in the internal revenue code of  as amended 
legal contingencies from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising out of the ordinary course of business 
further  we are currently engaged in certain shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 
these contingencies require management judgment in order to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
in summary  sfas requires that the liability shall be recognized and measured initially at its fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for one time termination benefits that meet certain requirements 
since sfas is effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   the adoption of sfas will have no effect on our current financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosures requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted this statement 
the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas requires disclosures of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
results of operations our consolidated financial information presents the net effect of the discontinued operation separately from the results of our continuing operations 
historical financial information has been reclassified to present consistently the discontinued operation of vialta 
the discussion and analysis that follow below generally focus on the continuing operations 
inflation has not had any material impact on our business to date

the following table summarizes revenues by our major product categories percentage of net revenues years ended december  dvd vcd communication and other pc audio total dvd revenues were million  an increase of million  or  from to primarily due to higher unit sales  partially offset by lower asp per unit 
while unit sales increased by  asp per unit decreased by from to although unit sales in were higher than in  unit sales in the third and fourth quarter of were lower than expected 
we believe this resulted in part from the entry of a new competitor that penetrated the market faster than we previously thought possible and in part from lower than expected consumer demand for dvd products 
we have filed a lawsuit in the united states against this new competitor  a company based in taiwan  requesting both damages and an injunction to stop the importation into the united states of dvd players containing products we believe infringe our intellectual property rights 
we expect this new competitor to gain market share among some china based oems with respect to the current version of our dvd chip for use in dvd players intended to be sold in the united states 
even if we are successful in this lawsuit  we expect to lose market share among some china 
table of contents based oems that would otherwise use the current version of our dvd chip in dvd players intended to be sold in markets outside the united states

asp per unit decreased by  whereas unit sales increased by 
we continue to target the market for this product line by lowering our product costs

we expect that international sales will continue to remain a high percentage of our net revenues 
gross margin gross profit increased to million in from million in gross margins were in and in the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the growth of our dvd business in  substantially offset by reduced sales and profitability of our other product categories 
although gross profit and margins increased in as compared to the preceding year  in the third quarter of we began experiencing increasing competition and pricing pressures for both our dvd and vcd products 
as a result  overall gross margins of over reported in the first and second quarters of decreased to in the fourth quarter 
we expect that gross margins will remain significantly below the levels experienced for the fiscal year at least until such time as our new product  the vibratto ii chip  or our other new products are introduced  achieve market acceptance  and are sold in volume 
as a result of intense competition in our markets  we expect the overall asp per unit for our existing products to decline over the product life  and in gross margins may continue to shrink 
we believe that in order to maintain or increase gross profit in  we must achieve higher unit volume in shipments  reduce costs  add new features and introduce new products 
research and development research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in research and development expenses decreased by million  or  from to primarily due to the decrease in amortization expenses of million  partially offset by the increase in salary expenses of million from research and development headcount increase

table of contents acquisitions and related charges netridium communications  inc netridium was founded in january and was acquired in february  when it was still a development stage company with no revenue 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the results of operations and cash flows of such acquisition have been included from the date of acquisition 
purchased in process research and development aggregating million for the netridium acquisition was charged to operations in the second quarter of technical infrastructure and covenants not to compete are being amortized over four years 
in connection with the acquisition  we granted certain netridium employees stock options to purchase a total of  shares of our stock at per share  the fair market value on the date of grant 
in addition  we have entered into employment contracts with certain former netridium employees  which  among other things  provide that if the employee stays with us for the applicable vesting periods during the four year term of the employment agreement  the employee s stock options will have a value of at least more than the exercise price when such options become exercisable 
accordingly  we are accruing this additional compensation expense over the four year term of the agreement 
approximately  of the options issued upon acquisition are subject to this guarantee 
we recorded approximately million  million and million as compensation expenses under this guarantee  for fiscal year  and  respectively 
netridium was developing its intellectual property and foundation technologies in the area of broadband data delivery to homes and in home data distribution 
netridium s first product was scheduled for release in the summer of we expected this acquisition to provide these foundation technologies as a turnkey solution to network equipment manufacturers and personal computer providers 
we planned to introduce a complete line of highly integrated technology products that would enable network manufacturers to produce reliable homelan solutions over ordinary telephone wires 
research and development expenses incurred on product development post acquisition were approximately million and million in and  respectively 
the product was not completed until february of no significant revenues have been recognized to date nor were significant revenues originally anticipated in  however  we believe that home networking is an important future market for us and this technology will be important to our efforts to exploit that market

we continue to monitor the carrying value of intangible assets related to the netridium acquisition in accordance with sfas and sfas in april  we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire silicon analog systems sas in a merger transaction to be accounted for as a purchase business combination 
sas was a canadian start up company engaged in developing single chip solutions for wireless communications 
this acquisition was effective on april  we paid million on the effective date and an additional million on april  the total purchase price of million along with  of acquisition cost was primarily allocated to goodwill  based on an independent appraisal 
the assets  liabilities and operating expenses for sas were not material to our financial position or results of operations 
at the time of acquisition  sas had generated approximately  in consulting revenue 
sas had also developed intellectual property in wireless communications as well as analog circuit design  areas of key interest to us 
because of our experience with mixed signal products  we expected that this acquisition would advance our expertise in advanced analog design enabling us to develop intellectual property for key products 
as of december   the sas design team is concentrating on video product development as well as radio frequency analog design  and designs from this group have been integrated into several video products 
sas has several patent applications pending and intends to seek further us and international patents on its technology whenever possible

there is no termination date to these agreements 
from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of trademarks  copyrights and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising out of the ordinary course of business 
further  we are currently engaged in certain shareholder class action and derivative lawsuits 
we intend to defend these suits vigorously and we may incur substantial expenses in litigating claims against third parties and defending against existing and future third party claims that may arise 
in the event of a determination adverse to us  we may incur substantial monetary liability and be required to change our business practices

table of contents we announced on august   that our board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to million shares of ess common stock  in addition to all shares that remain available for repurchase under previously announced programs  on the same terms and conditions as these prior repurchase programs 
the repurchase program is being effected from time to time  depending on market conditions and other factors  through open market purchases 
there was no purchase made under this program as of december  and we commenced our repurchase under this program in january we have repurchased  shares for an aggregated price of million at market prices ranging from to per share under this program as of march   leaving approximately million shares available for repurchase as of such date 
upon repurchase  these shares were retired and no longer deemed outstanding 
to date  we have not declared or paid cash dividends to our stockholders and do not anticipate paying any dividend in the foreseeable future due to a number of factors  including the volatile nature of the semiconductor industry and the potential requirement to finance working capital in the event of a significant upturn in business 
we reevaluate this practice from time to time but are not currently contemplating the payment of a cash dividend 
we have no long term debt 
our capital expenditures for the next twelve months are anticipated to be approximately million 
we may also use cash to acquire or invest in complementary business or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investment in  such business  products or technologies owned by third parties 
also  from time to time the board of directors may approve the expenditure of cash resources to repurchase our common stock as market conditions warrant 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our existing cash and short term investments as of december   together with short term investments  funds expected to be generated by operations  available borrowings under our line of credit and other financing options  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  mergers and acquisitions  strategic investment requirements  acquisitions of property and equipment  stock repurchases and other potential needs for the next twelve months 
factors that may affect future results our business is highly dependent on the expansion of the consumer electronics market 
since the second half of  we have shifted our primary focus from the pc audio business to developing products primarily for the consumer digital home entertainment market 
currently  our sales of video system processor chips to the dvd and vcd including vcd and svcd player markets account for a majority of our net revenues 
we expect that the consumer digital home entertainment market will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
however  our strategy in this market may not be successful 
given the current economic environment and other consumer electronics products  consumer spending on dvd players and other home electronics may not increase as expected or may even weaken or fall 
if the markets for these products and applications decline or fail to develop as expected  or we are not successful in our efforts to market and sell our products to manufacturers who incorporate integrated circuits into these products  our financial results will be harmed 
in addition  the potential decline in consumer confidence and consumer spending that may be occasioned by terrorist attacks or armed conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations that may cause volatility or a decline in the price of our stock 
historically  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly 
our future quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and 
table of contents investors in a particular future period 
the price of our common stock could decline due to such fluctuations 
the following factors may cause significant fluctuations in our future quarterly operating results changes in demand for our products  changes in the mix of products sold and our revenue mix  charges related to excess inventory  charges related the net realizable value of inventory  seasonal customer demand  increasing pricing pressures and resulting reduction in the asp of any or all of our products  gain or loss of significant customers  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  the timing of our and our competitors new product announcements and introductions and the market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our and our customers products  the timing of significant customer orders  availability and cost of raw materials  significant increases in expenses associated with the expansion of operations  availability and cost of foundry capacity  a shift in manufacturing of consumer electronic products away from china  and loss of key employees which could impact sales or the pace of product development 
we often purchase inventory based on sales forecasts and if anticipated sales do not materialize  we may continue to experience significant inventory charges 
we currently place non cancelable orders to purchase our products from independent foundries on an approximately three month rolling basis  while our customers generally place purchase orders with us that may be cancelled without significant penalty 
if anticipated sales and shipments in any quarter are cancelled or do not occur as quickly as expected  expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high and we may be required to record significant inventory charges in our statement of operations in a particular period 
as our business grows  we may increasingly rely on distributors  which may further impede our ability to accurately forecast product orders 
we have experienced significant inventory charges in the past and we may continue to experience these charges in future periods 
our research and development investments may fail to enhance our competitive position 
we invest a significant amount of time and resources in our research and development activities to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and the commitment of extensive engineering resources 
we incur substantial research and development costs to confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product that in the end may not be successful 
if we are not able to successfully complete our research and development projects on a timely basis  we may face competitive disadvantages 
there is no assurance that we will recover the development costs associated with these projects or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future research and development efforts 
one of our significant projects is the development of a next generation dvd processor chip that will incorporate three independent processors and allow us to support additional features  including the linux  pocketpc formerly wince and vxworks operating systems 
this will require a new architecture and a complete system on a chip design  which is extremely complex and may not be ultimately feasible 
if we are unable to successfully develop this next generation dvd processor chip  or complete other significant research 
table of contents and development projects  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
for example  we are currently developing our dvd integrated chip solution vibratto ii  and we have incurred significant amount of resources on this complicated project 
if we are not able to introduce vibratto ii on a timely basis or if vibratto ii fails to attain market acceptance  we may continue to lose market shares to competitors and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we may need to acquire other companies or technologies to successfully compete in our industry and we may not be successful acquiring key targets or integrating these acquisitions with our business 
we will continue to regularly consider the acquisition of other companies or the products and technologies of other companies to complement our existing product offerings  improve our market coverage and enhance our technological capabilities 
there may be technologies that we need to acquire or license in order to remain competitive 
however  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisitions and investments or be able to acquire them at costs that are competitive 
acquisitions and investments carry risks that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including the failure to integrate with existing products and corporate culture  the inability to retain key employees from the acquired company  diversion of management attention from other business concerns  the potential for large write offs  the failure of the acquired products or technology to attain market acceptance  the failure to leverage the acquired products and technology to attain market acceptance  issuances of equity securities dilutive to our existing shareholders  and the incurrence of substantial debt and assumption of unknown liabilities 
our sales may fluctuate due to seasonality and changes in customer demand 
since we are primarily focused on the consumer electronics market  we are likely to be affected both by changes in consumer demand and by seasonality in the sales of our products 
historically  over half of consumer electronic products are sold during the holiday seasons 
consumer electronic product sales have historically been much higher during the holiday shopping season than during other times of the year  although the manufacturers shipments vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including retail levels and retail promotional activities 
in addition  consumer demand often varies from one product to another in consecutive holiday seasons  and is strongly influenced by the overall state of the economy 
because the consumer electronic market experiences substantial seasonal fluctuations  seasonal trends may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate and our inability to forecast these trends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in  for example  we did not experience as much of a seasonal demand for our dvd chips as we expected 
we believe that this was due in part to the entry of a new competitor  but also in part to lower than expected consumer demand for dvd players  which experienced strong sales during the holiday seasons 
in the future  if the market for our products is not as strong during the holiday seasons  whether as a result of changes in consumer tastes or because of an overall reduction in consumer demand due to economic conditions  we may fail to meet expectation of securities analysts and investors which could cause our stock price to fall 
our products are subject to increasing pricing pressures 
the markets for most of the applications for our chips are characterized by intense price competition 
the willingness of oems to design our chips into their products depends  to a significant extent  upon our ability to 
table of contents sell our products at cost effective prices 
we expect the asp of our existing products to decline significantly over the life of each product as the markets for our products mature  new products or technology emerges and competition increases 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in product prices or are unable to introduce more advanced products with higher margins  our gross margins may decline 
we may lose business to competitors who have significant competitive advantages 
our existing and potential competitors consist  in part  of large domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources  greater intellectual property rights  broader product lines and longer standing relationships with customers than we have 
our competitors also include a number of independent and emerging companies who may be able to better adapt to changing market conditions and customer demand 
in addition  some of our current and potential competitors maintain their own semiconductor fabrication facilities and could benefit from certain capacity  cost and technical advantages 
dvd and vcd players face significant competition from video on demand  vcrs and other video formats 
in addition  we expect that the dvd platform for the dhs will face competition from other platforms including stbs  as well as multi function game boxes being manufactured and sold by large companies 
some of our competitors may be more diversified than us and supply chips for multiple platforms 
a decline in dvd sales may have a disproportionate effect on us as we shift our focus to this market 
any of these competitive factors could reduce our sales and market share and may force us to lower our prices  adversely affecting our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is dependent upon retaining key personnel and attracting new employees 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of fred sl chan  our chairman of the board  and robert l 
blair  our president and ceo 
in the past  mr 
chan has served as our president and chief executive officer in addition to being our chairman of the board 
mr 
chan is critical to maintaining many of our key relationships with customers  suppliers and foundries in asia 
the loss of the services of mr 
chan  mr 
blair  or any of our other key executives could adversely affect our business 
we may not be able to retain these key personnel and searching for their replacements could divert the attention of other senior management and increase our operating expenses 
we currently do not maintain any key person life insurance 
to manage our future operations effectively  we will need to hire and retain additional management personnel  design personnel and software engineers 
we may have difficulty recruiting these employees or integrating them into our business 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly design personnel and software engineers  could make it difficult to implement our key business strategies  such as timely and effective product introductions 
our customer base is highly concentrated  so the loss of a major customer could adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our net revenues has been derived from sales to a small number of our customers 
during  sales to our top five end customers including end customers that buy our products from our distributor dynax electronics were approximately of our net revenues 
we expect this concentration of sales to continue along with other changes in the composition of our customer base 
the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from one or more major customers or the loss of one or more major customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  any difficulty in collecting amounts due from one or more key customers could harm our financial condition 

table of contents we rely on a single distributor for a significant portion of our revenues and if this relationship deteriorates our financial results could be adversely affected 
sales through our largest distributor dynax electronics a hong kong based company were approximately  and of our net revenues in  and dynax electronics is not subject to any minimum purchase requirements and can discontinue marketing any of our products at any time 
in addition  dynax electronics has rights of return for unsold product and rights to pricing allowances to compensate for rapid  unexpected price changes  therefore we do not recognize revenue until dynax electronics sells through to our end customers 
if our relationship with dynax electronics deteriorates  our quarterly results could fluctuate significantly as we experience short term disruption to our sales and collection processes  particularly in light of the fact that we maintain significant account receivable from dynax electronics 
as our business grows  we may increasingly rely on distributors  which may reduce our exposure to future sales opportunities 
although we believe that we could replace dynax electronics as our distributor for the hong kong and china markets  there can be no assurance that we could replace dynax electronics in a timely manner or if a replacement were found that the new distributor would be as effective as dynax electronics in generating revenue for us 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use and we may be subject to claims of infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
to protect our intellectual property rights we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws and confidentiality procedures 
as of december   we had patents granted in the united states 
these patents will expire over time commencing in and ending in in addition  as of december   we had corresponding foreign patents  which are going to expire over time commencing in and ending in we cannot assure you that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or applications in preparation or that any claims allowed from pending applications or applications in preparation will be of sufficient scope or strength 
we may not be able to obtain patent protection in all countries where our products can be sold 
also  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken to protect our intellectual property will adequately prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions 
litigation by or against us could result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not such litigation results in a favorable determination for us 
any claim  even if without merit  may require us to spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or cross licensing arrangements  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we may be required to pay substantial damages or cease the use and sale of infringing products  or both 
in general  a successful claim of infringement against us in connection with the use of our technologies could adversely affect our business 
for example  if we lose the townshend modem case  our results of operations could be significantly harmed 
we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
in the event of an adverse result in any such litigation our business could be materially harmed 
we have significant international sales and operations that are subject to the special risks of doing business outside the united states 
substantially all of our sales are to customers in hong kong  china  taiwan  korea  singapore and japan 
during  sales to customers in hong kong  china and taiwan were in excess of of our net revenues 
if our sales in one of these countries  such as china  were to fall  our financial condition could be materially impaired 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenues 
in addition  substantially all of our products are manufactured  assembled and tested by 
table of contents independent third parties in asia 
there are special risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including unexpected changes in legislative or regulatory requirements and related compliance problems  political  social and economic instability  lack of adequate protection of our intellectual property rights  changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  including changes in most favored nations trading status  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles and greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  potentially adverse taxes  difficulties in obtaining export licenses for technologies  language and other cultural differences  which may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our us and foreign counterparts  and currency exchange risks 
our products are manufactured by independent third parties 
we rely on independent foundries to manufacture all of our products 
substantially all of our products are currently manufactured by taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company  ltd  united microelectronics corporation and other independent asian foundries 
our reliance on these or other independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the possibility of an interruption or loss of manufacturing capacity  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the inability to reduce our costs as rapidly as competitors who perform their own manufacturing and who are not bound by volume commitments to subcontractors at fixed prices 
any failure of these third party foundries to deliver products or otherwise perform as requested could damage our relationships with our customers and harm our sales and financial results 
to address potential foundry capacity constraints in the future  we may be required to enter into arrangements  including equity investments in or loans to independent wafer manufacturers in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  joint ventures to own and operate foundries  or take or pay contracts that commit us to purchase specified quantities of wafers over extended periods 
these arrangements could require us to commit substantial capital or to grant licenses to our technology 
if we need to commit substantial capital  we may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing  which could result in dilution to our shareholders 
because we purchase raw materials from a limited number of suppliers  we could experience disruptions or cost increases we depend on a limited number of suppliers to obtain adequate supplies of quality raw materials on a timely basis 
we do not generally have guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers 
if we have difficulty in obtaining materials in the future  alternative suppliers may not be available  or if available  these suppliers may not provide materials in a timely manner or on favorable terms 
if we cannot obtain adequate materials for the manufacture of our products  we may be forced to pay higher prices  experience delays and our relationships with our customers may suffer 

table of contents we have extended sales cycles  which increase our costs in obtaining orders and reduce the predictability of our earnings 
our potential customers often spend a significant amount of time to evaluate  test and integrate our products 
our sales cycles often last for several months and may last for up to a year or more 
these longer sales cycles require us to invest significant resources prior to the generation of revenues and subject us to the risk that customers may not order our products as anticipated 
in addition  orders expected in one quarter could shift to another because of the timing of customers purchase decisions 
any cancellation or delay in ordering our products after a lengthy sales cycle could adversely affect our business 
our products are subject to recall risks 
the greater integration of functions and complexity of our products increases the risk that our customers or end users could discover latent defects or subtle faults in our products 
these discoveries could occur after substantial volumes of product have been shipped  which could result in material recalls and replacement costs 
product recalls could also divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development needs and could adversely impact our customer relationships 
in addition  we could be subject to product liability claims that could distract management  increase costs and delay the introduction of new products 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
downturns in the industry have been characterized by abrupt fluctuations in product demand  production over capacity and accelerated decline of asp 
current trade association data indicate that the semiconductor industry has experienced a severe downturn since the third quarter of and this downturn is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
this downturn could harm our net revenues and gross margins if asp continue to decline or demand falls 
we cannot assure you that the market will stabilize or improve in the near term 
a prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry could materially and adversely impact our business and results of operations 
we may need additional funds to execute our business plan  and if we are unable to obtain such funds  we may not be able to expand our business  and if we do raise such funds  your ownership in ess may be subject to dilution 
we may be required to obtain substantial additional capital to finance our future growth  fund our ongoing research and development activities and acquire new technologies or companies 
to the extent that our existing sources of liquidity and cash flow from operations are insufficient to fund our activities  we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time 
if our performance or prospects decrease  we may need to consummate a private placement or public offering of our capital stock at a lower price than you paid for your shares 
if we raise additional capital through the issuance of new securities at a lower price than you paid for your shares  you will be subject to additional dilution 
further  such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our existing common stock 
additional financing may not be available to us when needed or  if available  it may not be available on terms favorable to us 
our success within the semiconductor industry depends upon our ability to develop new products in response to rapid technological changes and evolving industry standards 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological changes  evolving industry standards and product obsolescence 
our success is highly dependent upon the successful development and timely introduction of new products at competitive prices and performance levels 
the success of new products depends on a number of factors  including anticipation of market trends  timely completion of product development  design and testing  
table of contents market acceptance of our products and the products of our customers  offering new products at competitive prices  meeting performance  quality and functionality requirements of customers and oems  and meeting the timing  volume and price requirements of customers and oems 
our products are designed to conform to current specific industry standards  however we have no control of future modifications to these standards 
manufacturers may not continue to follow the current standards  which would make our products less desirable to manufacturers and reduce our sales 
our success is highly dependent upon our ability to develop new products in response to these changing industry standards 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
the markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological changes  price reductions and rapid product obsolescence 
competition typically occurs at the design stage  when customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
because of shortened life cycles  there are frequent design win competitions for next generation systems 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with products that may be provided at lower costs or provide higher levels of integration  higher performance or additional features 
advancements in technology can change the competitive environment in ways that may be adverse to us 
for example  today s high performance central processing units in pcs have enough excess computing capacity to perform many of the functions that formerly required a separate chip set  which has reduced demand for our pc audio chips 
the announcements and commercial shipments of competitive products could adversely affect sales of our products and may result in increased price competition that would adversely affect the asp and margins of our products 
the following factors may affect our ability to compete in our highly competitive markets the timely shipment of our anticipated dvd integrated chip  the vibratto ii  the timely shipment of the next generation of our current dvd decoder chip  the vibratto s  the timely shipment of our new vcd chip  the visba iv  the price  quality and performance of our products and the products of our competitors  the timing and success of our new product introductions and those of our customers and competitors  the emergence of new multimedia standards  the development of technical innovations  the ability to obtain adequate foundry capacity and sources of raw materials  the rate at which our customers integrate our products into their products  the number and nature of our competitors in a given market  and the protection of our intellectual property rights 
the value of our common stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the price of our common stock fluctuates significantly 
many factors influence the price of our common stock  including future announcements concerning us  our competitors or our principal customers  such as quarterly operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  technological innovations  new product introductions  governmental regulations  or litigation  the liquidity within the market for our common stock  
table of contents sales by our officers  directors and other insiders  investor perceptions concerning the prospects of our business and the semiconductor industry  market conditions and investor sentiment affecting market prices of equity securities of high technology companies  and general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions or international currency fluctuations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risks we fund our operations with cash generated by operations  the sale of marketable securities and short and long term debt 
as we operate primarily in asia  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates  which could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in foreign exchange rates  our product sales and all of our arrangements with our foundry and test and assembly vendors are denominated in us dollars 
we have not entered into any currency hedging activities 
interest rate risks we also invest in short term investments 
consequently  we are exposed to fluctuation in rates on these investments 
increases or decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in the fair value of these investments 
in addition  the credit worthiness of the issuer  relative values of alternative investments  the liquidity of the instrument  and other general market conditions may affect the fair values of interest rate sensitive investments 
in order to reduce the risk from fluctuation in rates  we invest in highly liquid governmental notes and bonds with contractual maturities of less than two years 
all of the investments have been classified as available for sale  and at december   the fair value of our investments approximated their costs
