item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we have restated our results for all periods  other than and  discussed below to combine the results of biochem  the merger with whom was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
the results for all periods  other than  disclosed below have also been restated to reflect the disposal of our otc business which has been accounted for as a discontinued operation 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
a results of operations for the years ended december  and i overview for the year ended december   our total revenues increased by to  million  compared to million in fiscal net income for the year ended december  was million compared to million in  an increase of 
however  as net income in the year ended december  included million of other charges comprising asset impairment and restructuring costs million  merger related transaction expenses million and a loss from the sale of our manufacturing facility in toronto  canada million  this growth rate appears much higher than that attributed to our ongoing operating activities 
ii total revenues our revenues are primarily derived from sales of our pharmaceutical products and royalties earned on products we have out licensed to third parties to market on our behalf 
the following table provides an analysis of our total revenues by source year ended december  change m m product sales licensing and development royalties other total  iii product sales for the year ended december   our product sales increased by to million  compared to million in the prior year 
the following table provides an analysis of our key product sales year ended december  change m m adderall xr adderall agrylin pentasa proamatine carbatrol calcichew range others total the following discussion includes references to prescription and market share data for our key products 
the source of this data is ims december adderall franchise at the outset  was to be a challenging year for our adderall franchise  as we expected to face strong competition from generic products 
in mid february  barr laboratories inc announced fda approval to market a generic version of adderall 
we had launched a new patent protected  once daily  formulation of adderall  called adderall xr  in the us on november  thus  our challenge for was to continue converting patients from our twice three times daily adderall product to the new patent protected formulation 
for the year ended december   sales of adderall xr were million compared to million in the last two months of the year of launch 
sales of adderall for the year ended december  were million compared to million in the comparative period 
this decline in adderall sales is largely due to our success in converting patients to the new patent protected  once daily formulation of the drug 
in addition  we have lost some adderall sales to generic competitors who launched their competing products from the middle of february according to ims data  total dollar sales from generic versions of adderall were million in on a combined basis  product sales from the adderall franchise in were up million  a increase compared to the prior year 
over the same period  the number of prescriptions written for the two products was marginally higher than the prior year  up 
this demonstrates that although our share of the us adhd prescription market in december was  versus in december  the total adhd market is growing strongly in dollar terms  during adderall xr is sold at a higher price than adderall  and this has had a favorable impact on our sales revenue in in addition  a lower medicaid utilization and rebate payments on adderall xr sales have also had a positive effect on our net sales  which we estimate to be between million and million 
million of adderall xr shipments were not recognized as revenue in as  following the guidelines of staff accounting bulletin no 
 we did not consider these sales to be realized and earned in that fiscal accounting period due to the extended credit terms we offered as an incentive to wholesalers on the initial launch stock 
these sales were recognized in the first quarter of there have been no such terms offered on any of our products within the year ended december  agrylin total agrylin sales for were million  an increase of compared to the prior year million 
underlying prescriptions for agrylin in the us  where it is the only product licensed for the treatment of essential thrombocythaemia  increased by  supported by a price increase in january shire achieved of the total us agrylin  hydrea and generic hydroxyurea prescription market in december  compared to in december pentasa for the year ended december  sales of pentasa  a treatment for ulcerative colitis  were up at million million 
over the same period  pentasa benefited from modest prescription growth of  which reflects limited physician promotions during pentasa sales benefited from two factory price increases during  a rise in january and a further increase in may pentasa had a prescription share of of the us oral mesalamine olsalazine market in december  compared with in december proamatine sales of proamatine  for the treatment of orthostatic hypotension  were million  higher than sales of million 
underlying prescriptions grew by during the year ended december  approximately of the reported sales growth is attributable to price increases 
proamatine sales also benefited from the launch of a new mg strength during proamatine had a share of the us prescription market for proamatine and fludrocortisone acetate prescriptions in december  an increase from in december carbatrol sales of carbatrol  for the treatment of epilepsy  were million in  an increase of over prior year sales of million 
over the same period  underlying prescriptions grew by 
carbatrol was launched in the us in june  and in the three years following launch the growth rate for this product has typically been much higher than the achieved in we have experienced supply constraints throughout but these have now been addressed 
the acquisition of the aps manufacturing facility will allow us to shift production of carbatrol in house 
we intend to promote carbatrol more actively during in fact  we re launched carbatrol in the us during january carbatrol achieved of the us extended release carbamazepine prescription market in december  compared with in december the following table presents our product sales by operating segment year ended december  change m m us international total product sales in the us continue to represent a significant percentage of our worldwide sales  in versus in the growth in us sales is for  which is lower than the seen for the previous year 
the main driver of this change was the slow down in growth within the us adderall franchise which  as explained above  was affected by product launches by generic competitors 
sales growth in our international business was in  compared to in the prior year 
there have been several new product launches in this sector during  including solaraze and the continued roll out of adept 
the calcichew range of products for the treatment of osteoporosis  continue to perform well and delivered sales growth of in iv licensing and development our licensing and development income decreased by million to million for the year to december  this was mainly due to a decrease in shire laboratories drug delivery contract revenue and the fact that revenues included license fee income of million in respect of galantamine from johnson johnson 
now that we have our own sales and marketing capabilities in seven of the major world pharmaceutical markets  it is less likely that we will seek third parties to market our own products on our behalf and thus  revenues from out licensing activities is minimal 
we continue to carry out some contract development work for third parties in the field of advanced drug delivery

other royalties are received in respect of reminyl from johnson johnson  and in addition a number of hormone replacement therapy hrt products from various licensees 
the growth rate shown above is largely due to reminyl royalties 
vi cost of product sales for the year ended december  our cost of product sales amounted to of product sales  a ratio consistent with a slight favorable mix of the higher margin products was mainly used to offset costs associated with enhancing internal and external production facility capabilities

excluding the effect of this warrant compensation charge  research and development expenditure increased by and as a proportion of total revenues represented 
generally  we aim to invest between and of our total revenues in research and development projects  but the level of expenditure required each year is largely dictated by the development phase of existing and newly in licensed projects

on or after august   the company may redeem  for cash  all or part of the notes providing the common share price has exceeded sterling equivalent at the time for of the consecutive dealing days in the period prior to redemption

these investments typically bear minimal risk

is encouraged 
the company plans to adopt sfas no 
for its fiscal year ending december  when adopted  prior extraordinary items related to the extinguishment of debt will need to be reclassified 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting and processing for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal liability be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
under sfas no 
 fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim and annual periods after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  we are assessing  but at this point do not believe the adoption of the recognition and initial measurement requirements of fin will have a material impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
fin 
this interpretation requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the company does not currently believe that it will be required to consolidate or disclose any spe on adoption of fin l critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and disclosures in our financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most significant  complex or subjective judgments  which are often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are those in relation to litigation  valuation of intangible assets  valuation of fixed asset investments  sales rebates and income taxes 
i litigation shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  in light of additional information being known 
in instances where shire is unable to develop a best estimate of loss  no litigation loss is recorded at that time 
as information becomes known a loss provision is set up when a best estimate can be made 
the best estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
ii valuation of intangible assets shire has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that shire records at acquisition cost 
as at december  the carrying value of such intangibles was million 
those assets which do not yet have a defined revenue stream and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed upon acquisition as acquired in process research and development  and those that do have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
management s estimate of the useful life considers  interalia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the entity  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life and the effects of demand  competition  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
there is a high occurrence of transactions involving the transfer of intangible assets between companies in the health care field  and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
shire uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets acquired and for the assessment of impairment 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future cash inflows and outflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
shire engages independent valuation experts who review shire s critical assumptions for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
shire reviews intangible assets for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flows approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its estimated discounted cash flow value 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   shire assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level based on a two step approach 
first  the carrying amount of the reporting unit is compared to the fair value as estimated by the future net discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit 
to the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  a second step is performed  wherein the reporting unit s assets and liabilities are fair valued 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the fair value of the reporting unit in excess of the fair value of all non goodwill assets and liabilities allocated to the reporting unit 
to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  impairment exists and must be recognized 
as of january   shire had goodwill with a net carrying value of million that was subject to the transition provision of sfas no 
during the first half of  shire performed the required impairment tests of goodwill as of january  and determined that there was no impairment 
a prolonged general economic downturn and  specifically  competitive pricing pressure  could create an imbalance of industry supply and demand  or otherwise diminish volumes or profits 
such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect our estimates of future net cash flows to be generated by our long lived assets 
consequently  it is possible that our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by additional impairment charges related to the recoverability of our long lived assets 
iii valuation of fixed asset investments the company has certain investments in equity securities 
all equity investments  where shire does not have the ability to exercise significant influence and where the equity securities are not marketable  are accounted for under the cost method 
at december  the carrying value of investments accounted for under the cost method was million 
under the cost method  investments in private companies are carried at cost  less provisions for other than temporary impairment in value 
for public companies  the company classifies its equity investments as available for sale and  accordingly  records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss  net of any related tax effect 
shire periodically reviews its fixed asset investments for other than temporary impairments whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairments include o the market value of a quoted investment being below the carrying value of the investment for an extended period  o adverse news flow for private company investments in relation to the progress of scientific technology development of compounds  and o recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price 
if the fair value appears to be below the carrying value we consider all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include o positive progress in the issuer s scientific technology development of compounds  o ongoing activity in collaborations with the issuer  o a lack of other substantial company specific adverse events causing a decline in value  o analysis and valuation of comparable companies  and o the overall financial condition of the issuer 
in instances where our review indicates that there is an other than temporary permanent impairment  shire writes down the investment to the then fair value of the investment  recording an impairment charge in the consolidated statement of operations 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments together with the determination of whether an unrealised loss is permanent requires significant judgment and can have a material impact on the reported results 
iv sales rebates sales deductions primarily consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  and trade discounts 
provision for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends 
provisions for product returns and trade discounts to customers are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates based upon past activity levels and duration of time in the processing of deductions 
the actual experience and the level of rebate may deviate from the estimate 
shire revises its estimates every period and may be required to adjust the estimate in a subsequent period 
v income taxes shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because shire operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
the company employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
the company also has significant deferred assets due to net operating losses nol s in the united states  canada and other countries 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
management has exercised judgment in determining the extent of the realization of these losses based upon estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nol s exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these nol s a valuation allowance has been made against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december  the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a treasury policies and organization our treasury activities are coordinated by our treasury function  based in the uk all treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved by the board 
as a matter of policy  we do not undertake speculative transactions which would increase our currency or interest rate exposure 
we are subject to market risk in the following areas b interest rate risk due to the high proportion of fixed rate debt  the company s interest charge has limited exposure to interest rate movements 
the convertible notes bear interest of per annum  payable semi annually 
this interest rate is fixed over the period of the debt  thus reducing any cash flow risk associated with movements in interest rates 
the interest rate risk that has been mitigated by obtaining a fixed rate debt is equivalent to a million saving per rise in interest rates per annum 
conversely a fall in interest rates by will effectively cost the company million 
in the year ended december   the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was approximately per annum 
the largest proportion of investments was in us dollar deposits 
c foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against us dollars for trading transactions and the translation of net assets and earnings of non us subsidiaries 
the main trading currencies of the company are the us dollar  the canadian dollar  pounds sterling and the euro 
the financial statements of foreign entities are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have a small proportion of debt denominated in foreign currencies 
as at december   a total of million was outstanding december  million in respect of loans denominated in canadian dollars 
the exposure to foreign exchange risk is managed and monitored by our treasury function  using forecasts provided by the operating units 
the company has not undertaken any foreign currency hedges through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts during the year to december  instead  exposures have been managed through natural hedging via the currency denomination of cash balances 
d market risk of investments as at december   the company has million of investments comprising equity investments funds  private companies and publicly quoted equities 
these investments are exposed to market risk 
no financial instruments or derivatives have been employed to hedge this risk
