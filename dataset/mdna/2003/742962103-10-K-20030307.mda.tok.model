item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview privatebancorp was organized as a delaware corporation in to serve as the holding company for a chicago based de novo start up bank 
our flagship downtown chicago location opened in we expanded to wilmette in north suburban cook county in and the oak brook facility in west suburban dupage county was established in we established the st 
charles office in january  in connection with our purchase of towne square financial corporation a company which was in the process of forming a de novo  or start up bank on august  on february   we consummated our acquisition of johnson bank illinois adding two additional locations of in lake forest and winnetka  illinois 
during the second quarter  we received regulatory approval to create a new banking subsidiary and on june   privatebancorp capitalized the privatebank st 
louis 
in may  the privatebank chicago opened a second branch in the fox valley area in geneva  illinois 
in december  the privatebank and trust company acquired a controlling interest in lodestar investment counsel  a chicago based investment advisor with million of assets under management at december  lodestar manages equity  balanced  and fixed income accounts primarily for high net worth individuals  retirement plans and charitable organizations with investable assets in excess of million  and shares a similar focus on highly personalized client service 
since year end to december   we have grown our asset base at a compound annual rate of to billion 
during the same period  loans have grown at a compound annual rate of to  deposits at a compound annual rate of to billion and trust assets under administration at a compound annual rate of to million 
diluted earnings per share eps have grown at a compound annual rate of to split adjusted since year end for financial information regarding our four separate lines of business  the privatebank chicago  the privatebank st 
louis  wealth management services and holding company activities  see note operating segments to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included on page f the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amounts and yields of interest earning assets as compared to the amounts and rates on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of net security gains and wealth management fee income  and to a lesser extent  fees for ancillary banking services 
non interest income from fees and deposit service charges are below peer group levels 
this is largely the result of the profile of our typical client 
our clients tend to have larger deposit account balances than customers of traditional banks 
because average balances tend to be high  we do not earn high service charge income typical of many retail banks 
non interest expenses are heavily influenced by the growth of operations 
our growth directly affects the majority of our expense categories 
critical accounting policies the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
reference should also be made to our critical accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f certain critical policies involve estimates and assumptions by management 
by their nature  changes in these assumptions and estimates could significantly affect our financial position or results of operations 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the reserve for loan losses  as described in both management s discussion and analysis and in the financial statement notes  is of particular significance to us 
in addition  effective january   we adopted fas no 
 which requires that goodwill is no longer amortized but is tested annually for impairment 
consolidated results of operations net income our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  our earnings per share increased as compared to the prior year earnings per share 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  excluding one time charges  our earnings were million  or per diluted share  in our earnings per share increased as compared to the prior year earnings per share  adjusted to exclude the one time charges 
net income for the year ended december  included a previously announced one time charge of  after tax  or per diluted share  comprised of severance packages for two departing executives as well as amounts incurred to secure their replacements 
the increase in earnings from operations is primarily attributable to growth in the balance sheet  particularly in loans and investment securities  funded by growth in deposits and improvement in our net interest margin 
increased fee income  mainly from income from the sale of residential real estate loans in the secondary market  also contributed to the improvement in income 
net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income and fees on earning assets and interest expense and amortization of fees on deposits and borrowings 
net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
interest income includes loan origination fees recorded from loans 
interest expense includes amortization of prepaid fees on brokered deposits and issuance costs of trust preferred securities 
the volume of non interest bearing funds  largely comprised of demand deposits and capital  also affects the net interest margin 
net interest income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of 
net interest income is affected by both the volume of assets and liabilities held and the corresponding rates earned and paid 
the increase in net interest income for is primarily attributable to growth in earning assets 
average earning assets for were billion compared to million for  an increase of 
our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
increased volumes of interest earning assets at lower rates were offset by reduced interest rates on liabilities

our net interest margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year 
during  we experienced net interest margin pressure as compared to due to the decrease in market interest rates that occurred throughout in addition  during our floating rate assets repriced faster than our deposits and floating rate deposits 
also  we continued to utilize brokered deposit transactions as part of our asset liability management strategy 
these brokered deposits have staggered maturities and provide a lower costing source of funding compared to traditional deposits 
for  we expect our net interest margin to improve if market interest rates increase relative to levels 
alternatively  if market interest rates decrease  we expect our net interest margin to continue to experience pressure 
a changing interest rate environment has an effect on our net interest margin 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is based on floating interest rates and will likely reprice faster than our deposits and floating rate borrowings

banking service charge income increased by  over the prior year 
trust fee revenue increased to million in compared to million in trust assets under administration decreased to million at year end  compared to million at december  attributable primarily to declines in equity valuations since the prior year  which was partially offset by increases in new business generated during the year

our efficiency ratio on a tax equivalent basis  which measures the percentage of net revenue that is expended as non interest expense for the year ended december  improved slightly to as compared to an efficiency ratio of for the year ended december  the improvement in our efficiency ratio during as compared to prior years demonstrates that our business development efforts at our new offices are generating revenue sufficient to offset the related operating expenses 
on a tax equivalent basis  this ratio indicates that during  we spent cents to generate each dollar of revenue  compared to cents in the prior year 
the privatebank st 
louis became profitable during the fourth quarter of our newest location in geneva is not yet profitable as the costs of business development continued to exceed the related operating expenses in however  the location has exceeded its growth targets for loans and deposits during we expect to continue to report improvements in our efficiency ratio as income sources contribute to our profitability in excess of the operating expense growth impact 
our efficiency ratio for was negatively impacted due to the start up nature of the st 
charles office and the st 
louis office 
our st 
charles office first broke even on a monthly basis in july  within one year of the acquisition date 
salary and employee benefit expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during  we added full time equivalent employees to our organization  an increase of to full time equivalent employees from at december  this includes the addition of managing directors and associate managing directors 
salary and employee benefit expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  full time equivalent employees increased to at december  from at december  the increase in salary and benefits is due primarily to the full effect of the johnson bank illinois acquisition  the opening and staffing of the privatebank st 
louis  and the addition of two senior officers responsible for establishing the geneva office 
our main office in chicago also experienced personnel growth during professional fees  which include legal  accounting  consulting services and investment management fees  increased to million for the year ended december  from for the increase between years is primarily due to higher legal  accounting and information system consultation services as well as consulting services related to the remodeling of four floors at the downtown chicago location 
during the fourth quarter of  the bank also commenced the implementation of a new telephone system 
in addition  the increase in wealth management related business has resulted in increased investment management fees paid to third parties during the years ended december  and during  expenditures for information technology totaled million  up from million at december   representing investments in software and hardware to upgrade the overall information technology infrastructure 
the new infrastructure has improved information systems performance as well as strengthened the organization s business continuity strategy 
the information technology steering committee  established in  monitored and provided oversight for our information technology strategic plan

the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by all available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified

it is our policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on any loan for which there exists reasonable doubt as to the payment of interest or principal 
nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest 
other than those loans reflected in the table above  we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured  or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms

potential problem loans 
in addition to those loans reflected in the table above  we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
loans in this category include those with characteristics such as past maturity more than days  those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends  or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments

the initial rate of interest on the revolver was  and most recently reset to on december  the collateral for this borrowing consists of the common stock of the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis  which is held in custody by the lender 
as of december   the outstanding balance was million 
on february   the company entered into a subordinated note issued to johnson international  inc and subsequently sold to a third party  in the principal amount of million 
the interest on the subordinated note is reset each quarter based on the three month libor rate 
the note is payable in full on or before february   and provides for certain rate escalation beginning after february  on february   the interest rate increased from libor basis points to libor basis points 
this pricing is in effect until february   at which point the pricing increases to libor until maturity on february  the average rate of interest on the subordinated note was during compared to during and most recently reset to on december  the company has the right to repay the subordinated note at any time after giving at least days  but not more than days advance notice 
on february   we issued million in trust preferred securities at a fixed rate of which mature on december  at our option  the securities may be redeemed prior to maturity on or after december  the trust preferred securities are presented in our consolidated balance sheet as long term debt trust preferred securities 
upon receipt of the net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting commissions and offering expenses and including the underwriters over allotment shares  we repaid the full amount of borrowings under a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank in the amount of million 
risk management we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates that could affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these market risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
during  we began to hedge interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments as risk management 
interest rate risk we use a combination of financial instruments  including medium term and short term financings and variable rate debt instruments and  to a lesser extent  interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related cash flows 
to manage this mix in a cost effective manner  in we entered into our first interest rate swap transaction in which we agreed to receive a fixed rate in exchange for payment of a floating rate based on an agreed upon notional amount 
the fair value of the swap associated with this fair value hedge was million on december  as market interest rates continued to decline to historic lows in the second half of  the value of the company s long term tax exempt bank qualified municipal bond portfolio increased 
in order to protect this gain should rates rise  the company entered into a million swap agreement whereby we sold the year swap and bought month libor to act as an economic hedge to a portion of our long municipal bonds 
at december  the market value of the interest rate swap associated with this economic hedge was a liability of million 
the loss on the swap is recognized in earnings and resulted from declines in market rates of interest since the third quarter during  we continued to actively manage our interest rate exposure in our balance sheet 
the declines in market rates gave us the opportunity to make changes to our investment security portfolio as part of the implementation of our asset liability management strategies 
throughout  we continued to replace specific investment securities with alternative investment securities with greater risk reward parameters on a selective basis 
the improvements in net interest margin resulting from the improved mix of investment securities coupled with our lower yielding sources of funding offset the yield compression experienced in our loan portfolio  which is more than half floating rate based 
we have not changed our interest rate risk management strategy from the prior year and do not foresee or expect any significant changes in our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but we are considering expanding our use of interest rate swaps on our debt obligations in the near future 
capital resources stockholders equity at december  rose to million  an increase of million from the year end level of million  due primarily to the increase in net income from the year ended december  as well as the increase in the fair value of investment securities classified as available for sale net of tax and increases in shares issued 
we are subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors  and the regulators can lower classifications in certain areas 
failure to meet various capital requirements can initiate regulatory action that could have a direct material effect on the financial statements 
the prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized  although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition 
if a banking subsidiary is not well capitalized  regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits 
if undercapitalized  capital distributions are limited as is asset growth and expansion and plans for capital restoration are required 
the following table reflects various consolidated measures of our capital at december  and december  leverage ratio tier risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio total equity to total assets as of december   all of the company s million of trust preferred securities are included in tier capital 
the tier qualifying amount is limited to of tier capital under federal reserve regulations 
the entire amount of trust preferred securities qualifies as tier capital 
a portion of the subordinated note in the amount of million that was issued to johnson international as consideration in connection with the johnson bank illinois acquisition qualifies as tier capital for regulatory capital purposes 
to be considered well capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
to be adequately capitalized  an entity must maintain a leverage ratio of at least  a tier risk based capital ratio of at least  and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
at december   we continued to exceed the minimum levels of all regulatory capital requirements  and were considered adequately capitalized under regulatory standards 
at december   our total risk based capital ratio was 
with the exception of the total risk based capital ratio  we exceeded the well capitalized levels of our regulatory capital requirements 
at december   the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis were considered well capitalized under all applicable regulatory standards  including total risk based capital ratio 
liquidity liquidity measures our ability to meet maturing obligations and our existing commitments  to withstand fluctuations in deposit levels  to fund our operations and to provide for our clients credit needs 
our liquidity principally depends on our cash flows from our operating activities  investment in and maturity of assets  changes in balances of deposits and borrowings and our ability to borrow funds in the money or capital markets 
liquidity management involves planning to meet anticipated funding needs at a reasonable cost 
liquidity management is guided by policies  formulated and monitored by our senior management and the banks asset liability committees  which take into account the marketability of assets  the sources and stability of funding and the level of unfunded commitments 
our principal sources of funds are deposits  short term borrowings and capital contributions by privatebancorp to the banks funded by proceeds from draws on our line of credit or through new capital 
our core deposits  the most stable source of liquidity due to the nature of long term relationships generally established with our clients  are available to provide long term liquidity 
at december   of our total assets were funded by core deposits  even with december  levels 
core deposits are defined to include all deposits including time deposits but excluding brokered deposits and public funds 
time deposits are included as core deposits since these deposits have historically not been volatile deposits for us 
over the past several years  our clients have chosen to keep the maturities of their deposits short 
we expect these short term certificates of deposit to be renewed on terms and with maturities similar to those currently in place 
in the event that certain of these certificates of deposit are not renewed and the funds are withdrawn from the bank  unless those deposits are replaced with traditional deposits  brokered deposits  borrowed money or capital  we will liquidate assets to reduce our funding needs 
we have continued to use federal home loan bank advances and brokered deposits as alternative methods of funding loan growth 
during  we first utilized brokered deposits as a funding tool to enhance liquidity in anticipation of increasing loan demand 
during and we expanded our brokered deposits program in order to fund liquidity of the privatebank chicago 
in we expect to continue to rely on brokered deposits together with increased federal home loan bank advances as alternative methods of funding loan growth 
we will first look toward internally generated deposits as funding sources  but plan to supplement our funding needs with non traditional funding sources as needed 
the privatebank st 
louis also purchases brokered deposits in the absence of traditional deposit growth sufficient to fund the expected loan growth in that market 
liquid assets refer to money market assets such as federal funds sold  as well as available for sale securities 
net liquid assets represent the sum of the liquid asset categories less the amount of assets pledged to secure public funds 
at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank chicago were million as compared to million at december  at december   net liquid assets at the privatebank st 
louis were million as compared to million at december  net cash inflows provided by operations were million for the year ended december  compared to a net inflow of million a year earlier 
net cash outflows from investing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to a net cash outflow of million a year earlier 
cash inflows from financing activities for the year ended december  were million compared to a net inflow of million in in the event of short term liquidity needs  the privatebank chicago and the privatebank st 
louis may purchase federal funds from correspondent banks 
in addition  we currently have available borrowing capacity of million under the million credit facility at the holding company 
we utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
we measure the impact of interest rate changes on our income statement through the use of gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 
we have structured the assets and liabilities of our company to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
our policy states that we shall maintain a gap position at the one year horizon of between and 
our position at december  was and was within the guidelines of our policy 
we have continued to maintain our gap position near the low end set by our policy guidelines and expect to continue to operate in this manner as long as the general rate structure of the economy and our business opportunities remain consistent 
therefore  generally speaking  a short term rise in interest rates will hurt our earnings  while a short term drop in interest rates would help our earnings 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement 
for example  a rapid drop in interest rates might cause our loans to repay at a more rapid pace and certain mortgage related investments to prepay more quickly than projected 
this could mitigate some of the benefits of falling rates that are expected when negatively gapped 
conversely  a rapid rise in rates could give us an opportunity to increase our margins and stifle the rate of repayment on our mortgage related loans which would increase our returns

the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
december  december  basis basis basis basis points points points points percentage change in net interest income due to an immediate basis point change in interest rates over a one year time horizon this table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december  and december   we would suffer a decline in net interest income of and  respectively over each one year period 
conversely  a shift of basis points would increase net interest income over a one year horizon based on december  balances  as compared to measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
changes in the effect on net interest income from a basis point movement at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
although we are negatively gapped within one year  the asset sensitive position of the balance sheet in the first days of the simulation  coupled with the timing of repricing within the to day bucket  leads to the increase in net interest income from a basis point move 
the difference in the effect on net interest income at december  as compared to december  is due to the differences in the timing  balances  and current rates versus simulated rates of repricing assets and liabilities 
management s likely reaction to changes in interest rates is incorporated in assumptions made in these calculations 
differences in these assumptions between the reporting periods have also had the effect of reducing the impact of a changing interest rate environment 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
