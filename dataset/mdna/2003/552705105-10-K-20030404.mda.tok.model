item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the consolidated financial statements include the company s accounts and its consolidated subsidiaries 
the company is organized into separate selling divisions  which are supported by common administrative functions such as credit  accounting  human resources  legal and computer support services 
all significant inter company balances and transactions among subsidiaries and divisions have been eliminated in consolidation 
product sales are recorded when goods are shipped and invoiced to the customer 
most sales made to domestic customers are on net day or net day credit terms after a credit review is performed to establish creditworthiness and to determine an appropriate credit limit 
international sales are made under varying terms depending upon the creditworthiness of the customer and include the use of letters of credit  payment in advance of shipment and open trade terms and revenue is deferred when collection is determined not to be probable 
cost of sales for most of the company s products includes the cost of the product shipped plus freight  customs and other costs associated with delivery from foreign contract manufacturers or from domestic suppliers 
selling  general and administrative costs include salaries  commissions and related benefits  depreciation  telephone  advertising  warranty  printing  product literature  sales promotion  legal  audit and other professional fees  supplies  engineering and travel 
the consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rate between the subsidiaries local currencies and the us dollar will affect the conversion of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
a small portion of the company s purchases and sales are derived from operations outside the us since the revenues and expenses of the company s foreign operations are denominated in local currency  exchange rate fluctuations between local currencies and the us dollar expose the company to currency exchange risks 
these risks increase when the company is unable to denominate sales and purchases in us dollars or shift the effect of these fluctuations to customers or suppliers 
management does not believe that such fluctuations in exchange rates will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company does not have any foreign exchange forward or currency contracts 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
because of the use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized when a firm sales agreement is in place  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred and collectibility is reasonably assured 
deferred income from the non compete and supply agreements see note to consolidated financial statements is recognized over the two year term of the agreements 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are comprised principally of goods held for resale  which are valued at the lower of cost first in first out or market 
inventories are written down to their estimated net realizable value for estimated obsolescence  returned inventory deemed not economical to repair or discontinued product lines 
this estimate is based upon historical results  current inventories on hand  market conditions and current and expected sales trends 
if market conditions become less favorable than those expected by management  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill other intangible assets the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  on january  it requires suspension of amortization on intangible assets with indefinite lives and establishes a requirement to test goodwill for impairment annually or at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the business units is determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of future cash flows and discount rates 
long lived assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the long lived assets may not be recoverable  an evaluation is performed 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in the company s market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  the carrying value is compared to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  then the net book values of such assets are written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows  including long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and the percentage of that market  grouping of assets  discount rate and terminal growth rates 
changes in these estimates effect the assessment of long lived assets that could result in future impairment charges 
deferred income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are regularly assessed for their likelihood and the amounts believed to be realizable 
projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance are incorporated in the considerations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the realization of net deferred tax assets and the associated valuation allowance 
due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize the net deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance has been recorded against the net deferred tax asset balance 
based on results of operations in future periods  the valuation allowance may need to be adjusted

although cash requirements will fluctuate depending on the timing and extent of many factors  the company believes that the cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commitments with definitive payment terms that will require cash outlays in the future 
these amounts are as of december  in thousands  later total years contractual obligations and commitments operating leases financing obligations severance obligations the company s significant operating leases include facilities and office equipment which require monthly payments for facilities ranging from  to  the company s leasing obligation with respect to the headquarters facility ends in june the rents for december through june are already prepaid 
the company holds an option to repurchase the headquarters facility for million for which the company must give notice of its intention on or before november  factors affecting the company s future results or the price of the company s stock 
set forth below and elsewhere in this report and other documents the company files with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report and other public statements that the company makes 
the company may not be profitable in the future the company has suffered losses in each of the last three years and the company has significant built in costs that it needs to reduce in order to reflect the smaller size of the company after the honeywell asset sale 
as a result  the company expects to continue to incur significant operating expenses and can give no assurance that it will achieve profitability or be capable of sustaining profitable operations 
should the company need additional capital  the company may have difficulty in raising the capital 
the company does not have a line of credit or other loan facility in place 
the company s working capital consists of the cash remaining from the honeywell asset sale and any cash generated by operations 
the company currently has no plan nor need for additional capital from either equity or debt in the next at least to months 
should the company want to  the company may not be able to locate purchasers of its equity securities to raise additional capital 
the company may not keep pace with technological advances or the company may pursue technologies that do not become commercially accepted and  in either case  customers may not buy the company s products and the company s revenues may decline 
the demand for the company s products can change quickly and in ways the company may not anticipate because the company s industry is generally characterized by rapid and sometimes disruptive technological developments  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements  limited ability to accurately forecast future customer orders  frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the company may not be able to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of any key personnel or the company s inability to hire new personnel with the requisite skills could restrict the company s ability to develop new products or enhance existing products in a timely manner  sell products to its customers or effectively manage the company s operations 
the common stock may be delisted from nasdaq if the stock price does not meet nasdaq s continued listing standards 
the common stock trades on the nasdaq exchange 
nasdaq has a number of continued listing requirements  including a minimum share price requirement of per share 
if the company s share price falls below per share for consecutive business days  then nasdaq could notify the company and give the company days to cure the deficiency or nasdaq could begin delisting proceedings 
those proceedings would lead to the common stock no longer trading on nasdaq 
delisting from nasdaq could result in a reduction in the liquidity of any investment in the common stock and an adverse effect on the trading price of the common stock 
delisting could also reduce the ability of holders of the common stock to purchase or sell shares as quickly and inexpensively as they have done historically 
this lack of liquidity could make it more difficult for the company to raise equity capital in the future 
the company s stock price has recently closed below per share at the end of a number of trading sessions 
the company may effect a reverse stock split  and  if so  the company s stock price may decline after the reverse stock split 
in response to the company s stock price and the minimum share price requirement  the company expects to request its stockholders to authorize a reverse stock split at the annual meeting of stockholders in june if the reverse split is approved by the company s stockholders and the company effects the reverse split  then the number of outstanding shares of common stock would be reduced 
with fewer shares outstanding  the company would expect the stock price to increase 
while a reverse stock split may enable the company to cure any nasdaq minimum share price deficiency  share prices of companies effecting reverse stock splits often decline and the company cannot assure its stockholders that the company s stock price would not decline after a reverse stock split 
some of the company s products are not as profitable as others 
some of the company s products might require a higher level of investment in engineering and distribution 
if revenues generated from these products become a greater percentage of the company s total revenues and if the expenses associated with these products on a percentage of revenues basis do not decrease  then the company s operating margins will be adversely affected 
third parties may claim that the company infringes their intellectual property rights 
the company has sometimes received notices from others claiming that the company infringes their patent and intellectual property rights  and the company has been involved in litigations on patent and intellectual property rights see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company expects the number of such claims will increase 
companies are more frequently seeking patent protection because developments in the law that may extend the ability to obtain such patents 
as a result  the company expects to receive more patent infringement claims 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s time and attention  require the company to enter into royalty and licensing agreements that the company would not normally find acceptable  require the company to stop selling or to redesign products  and require the company to pay damages 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in security prices  foreign exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect the company s future results of operations and financial condition 
exposure to these risks is managed through regular operating and financing activities 
foreign exchange after the honeywell asset sale  the company s international assets and liabilities have been significantly reduced 
the changes in the foreign currency rates are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s future consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the access control office in lausanne  switzerland is the company s only significant foreign based operation 
although the us dollar weakened against the swiss franc in  this office accounted for only of worldwide sales in  in and in specifically  changes in the exchange rates between the us dollar and swiss franc are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the company s future consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company issued long term  inter company loans to its foreign subsidiaries 
since these loans were denominated in us dollars  the foreign subsidiaries were exposed to the effect of changes in spot exchange rates of their local currencies relative to the us dollar 
most of these loans have generated foreign currency losses during the past few years 
in the past  these losses were shown as a component of accumulated other comprehensive losses and not included as a component of operating income 
as a result of the honeywell asset sale  management determined that these loans could not be repaid and recognized approximately million of accumulated foreign currency losses in the consolidated results of operations in december interest rates after the honeywell asset sale  the company s credit facility with frost national bank was fully repaid 
an interest rate swap agreement with bank one remains in effect through february  this agreement provides for a fixed rate of on million of debt 
because the company has no underlying debt which is hedged by this agreement changes in market value do not affect cash flows  and a change in interest rates would affect the company s financial position by approximately  this does not include any potential penalties or fees that would have to be paid to the lender in the event of early termination of the agreement
