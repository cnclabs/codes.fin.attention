item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the operations of the company and its subsidiary  the bank  are generally influenced by overall economic conditions  the related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the regulatory policies of financial institution regulatory authorities  including the commissioner  the federal reserve board and the fdic 
the bank monitors its exposure to earnings fluctuations resulting from market interest rate changes 
historically the bank s earnings have been vulnerable to changing interest rates due to differences in the terms to maturity or repricing of its assets and liabilities 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the bank s net interest income and net income could be negatively affected as interest sensitive liabilities deposits and borrowings could adjust more quickly to rising interest rates than the bank s interest sensitive assets loans and investments 
the following is a discussion and analysis of the company s results of operations for the last three fiscal years and its financial condition at the end of fiscal years and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the allowance for loan losses 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis in making judgments about the carrying values of assets that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the amount derived from management s estimates and assumptions under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the allowance for loan losses policy is a critical accounting policy that required the most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the level of the allowance required in relation to the estimated loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and therefore regularly evaluates it for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as prior loan loss experience  the character and size of the loan portfolio  business and economic conditions and management s estimation of future losses 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for loan losses 
refer to the discussion of allowance for loan losses in the business section and notes and to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of management s estimation process and methodology related to the allowance for loan losses 
results of operations the company reported net income of million or per diluted share for fiscal  as compared to million  or per diluted share for fiscal and million or per diluted share for fiscal the company s earnings in fiscal were adversely affected by two significant items  namely  state legislation the reit legislation passed in march that retroactively eliminated the dividends received deduction on dividends received from the bank s reit subsidiary and legal fees incurred in connection with litigation with certain of the company s shareholders 
the reit legislation resulted in an increase in the company s provision for income taxes of thousand in the fourth quarter of fiscal in june  a group of banks negotiated a settlement with the massachusetts department of revenue dor and  as a result  the bank will recognize in the first quarter of fiscal a reduction in the company s provision for income taxes of thousand 
the legal fees associated with the litigation with certain shareholders  who initially filed suit against the company in october following the annual meeting of shareholders  totaled approximately thousand  net of taxes 
the company has coverage under its directors and officers liability insurance policy for reimbursement of legal fees  subject to limitations  incurred in connection with this litigation 
the extent of coverage is currently being resolved with the insurance carrier 
at march   the company had not received any insurance reimbursement and  accordingly  net income was reduced to the extent of legal fees incurred 
the company s earnings decrease for fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to write downs of thousand in certain equity securities which had experienced a decline in fair value judged by management to be other than temporary  partially offset by higher net interest income 
interest rate spread 
the company s and the bank s operating results are significantly affected by its net interest spread  which is the difference between the yield on loans and investments and the interest cost of deposits and borrowings 
the interest spread is affected by economic conditions and market factors that influence interest rates  loan demand and deposit flows

the company experienced a million overall increase in net interest and dividend income for the year ended march  compared to fiscal interest income on loans increased by million to million due to a million increase in average loan balances partially offset by a basis point decline in the average rate earned 
during fiscal  the bank commenced its mortgage banking initiative and sought to increase its origination of residential mortgage loans and to eliminate the purchase of such loans 
with the continuing decline of interest rates which reached a forty year low in fiscal  the bank was able to double its origination of such loans to million of which million were sold in the secondary market 
the bank has continued to emphasize commercial real estate lending in order to diversify the loan portfolio and improve overall portfolio yield 
interest and dividend income on investments decreased by thousand in fiscal due primarily to a basis point decrease in the rate earned on investments and a million decrease in the average balance of investments 
the overall total average balance of interest earning assets increased by million from fiscal to fiscal  and the average yield on all interest earning assets decreased by basis points between the two fiscal years 
the bank experienced a thousand overall increase in net interest and dividend income for the year ended march  compared to fiscal interest income on loans decreased by million to million due to a million decrease in average loan balances and a basis point decline in the average rate earned 
during fiscal year  the bank originated and purchased new loans amounting to million  including million during the fourth quarter of the year 
with declining interest rates  management had decided to slow down the origination of fixed rate residential loans during the first half of the year 
during the second half of the year  the bank priced its residential loans more competitively which increased origination volume 
additionally  interest and dividend income on investments increased by thousand in fiscal due primarily to an million increase in average total balances of investments partially offset by a basis point decrease in the rate earned on investments 
the overall total average balance of interest earning assets increased by million from fiscal to fiscal  and the average yield on all interest earning assets decreased by basis points between the two fiscal years 
interest expense 
for fiscal  interest expense on deposits decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease can be attributed primarily to a basis point reduction in the cost of deposits in fiscal reflecting the series of reductions in interest rates initiated by the federal reserve board beginning in january interest expense on borrowings increased thousand as the average balance of borrowings rose to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  which was partially offset by a decrease of basis points in the rate paid on these borrowings to in fiscal from in fiscal there was an overall increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million during fiscal compared to fiscal for fiscal  interest expense on deposits decreased by million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease can be attributed primarily to a basis point reduction in the cost of deposits in fiscal reflecting the series of reductions in interest rates initiated by the federal reserve board beginning in january and the repricing of nearly of certificates of deposit outstanding at march  in fiscal interest expense on borrowings decreased thousand as the average balance of borrowings rose to million during fiscal from million during fiscal  which was more than offset by a decrease of basis points in the rate paid on these borrowings to in fiscal from in fiscal there was an overall increase in the average balance of interest bearing liabilities of million during fiscal compared to fiscal provision for loan losses 
due to the high level of asset quality  as measured by low delinquency rates and the absence of non performing assets during the past two years  the bank made no provision for loan losses during fiscal  and at march  and  the bank had no non performing loans 
non interest income 
total non interest income for fiscal was million  compared to thousand during fiscal during the second half of fiscal  the bank commenced its mortgage banking initiative and sold million of fixed rate residential mortgage loans in the secondary market 
these loans were sold on a servicing released basis 
the bank realized a gain of thousand on the sale of these loans 
non interest income in fiscal was adversely affected by the additional write down of thousand in certain equity securities  which had experienced a decline in fair value judged to be other than temporary 
total non interest income for fiscal was thousand  compared to million during fiscal the primary reason for the thousand decline in fiscal was the write down of thousand in certain equity securities which had experienced a decline in fair value judged to be other than temporary and a decrease in gains on the sale of securities 
partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in deposit service charges attributable to an increase in core deposit accounts and  for the first time  brokerage income from the bank s new offering of investment products through a third party 
non interest expenses 
non interest expenses increased million during fiscal  as compared to the year ended march  this increase is due to increases in salaries and employee benefits million  data processing expenses thousand  professional fees million  advertising thousand and other non interest expenses thousand  partially offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization thousand 
salaries and employee benefits increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to several factors including additional lending personnel in both the residential and commercial real estate areas  an overall salary increase of approximately  additional esop expense associated with shares acquired during the year and bonuses earned in connection with the bank s management incentive compensation plan no bonuses were earned in fiscal 
data processing expenses increased by thousand  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to volume related charges for both data processing and item processing 
professional fees increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to legal fees associated with pending litigation with certain of the company s shareholders and  to a lesser extent  legal and other professional fees incurred in connection with the contested election of directors at the annual meeting of stockholders 
professional fees incurred for such activities aggregated approximately million in fiscal exclusive of such costs  professional fees would have been approximately thousand in fiscal future legal fees associated with this litigation are likely to be significant 
as previously noted  the company has coverage under its directors and officers liability insurance policy for reimbursement of legal fees  subject to limitations  incurred in connection with the shareholder litigation 
no reimbursement of legal fees was received in fiscal management is currently working with its insurance carrier to ensure that the company receives full reimbursement of all legal fees to which it is entitled 
at this time  no estimate of any future insurance recovery is available 
advertising expense increased by thousand  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to increased promotion of the bank s expanded residential and commercial real estate lending programs 
during fiscal  the bank had reduced its use of advertising to promote certificates of deposit 
other non interest expenses increased by thousand  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal such increase was due to several factors including the accrual for the bank s portion of the estimated cost of resolution of a commercial claim filed in  as well as increases in atm expense  memberships and contributions  communication costs and directors fees 
non interest expense increased thousand during fiscal  as compared to the year ended march  such increase is primarily due to increases in professional fees of thousand and data processing service fees of thousand  partially offset by decreases in advertising of thousand and occupancy and equipment expenses of thousand 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expenses was virtually unchanged during fiscal the increase in professional fees of thousand in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased legal and consulting costs 
the increase in data processing service fees was due to the change  in november  to a new data processing system more suitable to the bank s needs 
the decrease in advertising of thousand occurred as the bank curtailed its regular promotion of certificates of deposit 
salaries and employee benefits expense decreased approximately thousand during fiscal despite a thousand increase in esop expenses due to the initial application of the fair value method of accounting for the allocation of esop shares to employees 
prior to fiscal  compensation expense was recognized as shares were allocated to esop participants accounts based on the cost of such shares to the esop 
in future periods  compensation expense relating to the esop may be significantly affected by the market value of the company s common stock 
income taxes 
the effective rates of income tax expense for the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
exclusive of the impact of an additional state tax provision  as described below  necessitated by recent tax legislation  the effective tax rate in would have been 
the governor of massachusetts signed legislation on march   which expressly disallows deductions for dividends received from a reit  resulting in such dividends being subject to state taxation 
in addition  the legislation applies retroactively to tax years ending on or after december  in the fourth quarter of  the company provided additional income taxes of thousand as a result of this legislation 
beginning in may  the dor had sent assessment notices and  later  demand notices to massachusetts financial institutions with reit subsidiaries asserting that the state statute providing for a dividends received deduction on certain distributions did not apply to dividends received from a reit subsidiary 
with the passage of the aforementioned legislation  the focus of this disputed matter was changed from an interpretation of tax law to the constitutionality of a retroactive change in the law 
given the significant financial impact of this issue on numerous massachusetts financial institutions and the considerable uncertainty of the constitutionality of the retroactive provisions of the legislation  a settlement was reached in june among the dor and the majority of affected financial institutions 
this settlement provides that of all dividends received by the bank from its reit subsidiary from through december are subject to state income taxes 
in addition  interest on the related taxes is to be assessed 
in settlement of this matter  the bank paid thousand in june and also recognized a reduction in its accrued tax liabilities of thousand  which will increase net income by the same amount in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of this legislation  the company s effective tax rate is likely to increase closer to the effective statutory rate for massachusetts financial institutions of approximately 
financial condition total assets at march  amounted to million  an increase of million from million at march  total assets at march  amounted to million  an increase of million from million at march  during fiscal  increases in the bank s core deposits were used to repay fhlb advances  which contributed to the modest asset growth in fiscal net loans increased million to million at march  from million at march  at march   mortgage loans were million  a million increase from march  the increase in mortgage loans was entirely attributable to increases in commercial real estate and construction loans which increased million and million  respectively 
the growth in commercial real estate loans and construction loans is attributable to the addition of experienced commercial lenders and expansion of the credit administration function in recent years 
residential mortgage loans decreased million during fiscal and represented of loans at march  compared to at march  during fiscal  the bank commenced operation of its mortgage banking initiative  which resulted in the sale of million in fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
total deposits at march  were million  a million increase from million one year earlier 
this increase is attributable to core deposit growth of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of million 
the majority of core deposit growth was in money market accounts  the highest paying core deposit account 
this growth has been aided by the introduction and promotion of the bank s community package account product  low interest rates and the continuing uncertainty in the stock market 
advances from the fhlb of boston decreased to million at march  from million at march  the bank decreased its borrowings from the fhlb of boston in fiscal consistent with its intent of reducing the utilization of fhlb advances 
stockholders equity increased to million at march  from million at march  due to million in comprehensive income  thousand in proceeds from option exercises and thousand in amortization of unearned esop compensation 
the increases in these equity accounts were substantially offset by million in esop stock purchases and thousand in dividends paid 
liquidity the company s primary sources of liquidity are dividends from its bank subsidiary and repayments of the esop loans 
in addition  the company has access to the capital markets to raise additional equity 
the bank s principal sources of liquidity are customer deposits  amortization and repayments of loan and mortgage backed security principal  fhlb of boston advances and maturities of various other investments 
these various sources of liquidity  as well as the bank s ability to sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market  are used to fund deposit withdrawals  loan originations and investments 
deposits have been a relatively stable source of funds for the bank despite significant competition 
during fiscal  deposit balances increased by million to million from million at march  the mix of deposits changed significantly during fiscal with term deposit certificates decreasing million while core deposit accounts increased million 
this shift occurred due to several factors including the low interest rate environment that prevailed throughout the year  the bank s emphasis of its core deposit products and less aggressive pricing of term deposits 
the bank is a member of the fhlb of boston and has the ability to borrow from the fhlb of boston for any sound business purpose for which the bank has legal authority  subject to such regulations and limitations as may be prescribed 
at march  and  the bank had outstanding fhlb of boston advances of million and million  respectively 
the fhlb of boston advances are secured by a blanket lien on residential first mortgage loans  us government and agency securities and all stock in the fhlb of boston 
at march   the bank had approximately million in unused borrowing capacity at the fhlb of boston 
the bank also may obtain funds from the federal reserve bank of boston by pledging certain of the bank s notes and drafts and is party to a retail cd brokerage agreement with a major brokerage firm 
the bank views these borrowing facilities as secondary sources of liquidity and has had no need to use them 
at march   outstanding commitments to originate mortgage loans totaled million  and commitments for unadvanced funds on home equity  commercial and construction loans totaled million 
at march   the bank also had million in commitments to sell residential mortgage loans 
management believes that the bank has adequate sources of liquidity to fund these commitments 
capital resources the company and the bank are required to maintain minimum capital ratios pursuant to federal banking regulations 
the first standard establishes a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations 
two categories of capital are defined tier or core capital stockholders equity and tier or supplementary capital 
total capital is the sum of both tier and tier capital 
according to the standards  tier capital must represent at least of qualifying total capital 
at march   the minimum total risk based capital ratio required was 
the company s and the bank s risk based total capital ratios at march  were and  respectively 
to complement the risk based standards  the fdic adopted a leverage ratio adjusted stockholders equity divided by total average assets of for the most highly rated banks and for all others 
the leverage ratio is to be used in tandem with the risk based capital ratios as the minimum standards for banks 
the company s and the bank s leverage ratios were and  respectively  at march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the bank s earnings are largely dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the bank seeks to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rate  or market risk  through active monitoring and management of its interest rate risk exposure 
the policies and procedures for managing both on and off balance sheet activities are established by the bank s asset liability management committee alco 
the board of directors reviews and approves the alco policy annually and monitors related activities on an ongoing basis 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the bank s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending  borrowing and deposit taking activities 
the main objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the bank s net interest income and preserve capital  while adjusting the bank s asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
however  a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
the bank quantifies its interest rate risk exposure using a sophisticated simulation model 
simulation analysis is used to measure the exposure of net interest income to changes in interest rates over a specific time horizon 
simulation analysis involves projecting future interest income and expense under various rate scenarios 
the simulation is based on actual cash flows and assumptions of management about the future changes in interest rates and levels of activity loan originations  loan prepayments  deposit flows  etc 
the assumptions are inherently uncertain and  therefore  actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and strategies 
the net interest income projection resulting from use of actual cash flows and management s assumptions is compared to net interest income projections based on an immediate shift of basis points upward and basis points downward basis points for 
the rate was lowered due to the continuing decline in interest rates 
internal guidelines on interest rate risk state that for every basis points immediate shift in interest rates  estimated net interest income over the next twelve months should decline by no more than 
the following table indicates the estimated exposure  as a percentage of estimated net interest income  for the twelve month period following the date indicated assuming an immediate and parallel shift for all market rates with other rates adjusting to varying degrees in each scenario based on both historical and expected spread relationships march  basis point increase in rates basis point decrease in rates only basis point decrease in rates only for each one percentage point change in net interest income in the projections  the effect on net income would be thousand assuming a tax rate
