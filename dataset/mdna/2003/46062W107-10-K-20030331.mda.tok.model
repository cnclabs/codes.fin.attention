item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to those statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed above under the subheading certain business considerations 
financial overview our revenues are generated from the sale of medical devices in three principal categories spinal implant products  orthobiologic products and minimally invasive surgery mis products 
our spinal implant products consist of titanium or stainless steel hooks  rods  plates  spacers and screws and related instruments required for the surgeon to assemble a construct which restores the natural anatomy of the spine  keeping it immobilized while a bone graft eventually fuses the vertebrae 
our orthobiologic products consist of bone graft substitute materials and products used to derive autologous growth factors agf 
agf fibrinogen rich extract is used to provide faster  more complete bone growth and enhance the performance of our bone graft products 
our mis products consist of instruments and devices used to deliver biocompatible materials into bony structures in a minimally invasive procedure 
all of our operations are located in the united states  however  we sell our products to customers both within and outside the united states 
within the united states  we distribute our products through independent agencies and direct sales representatives 
the independent agencies and our direct sales representatives provide a delivery and consultative service to our surgeon and hospital customers and receive commissions based on sales in their territories 
the commissions are reflected in our income statement within selling and marketing expense 
for our spinal implant products and mis products  we invoice hospitals directly following a surgical procedure in which our products are used 
these products are made available to hospitals from consignment inventories maintained by our independent agencies  or from loaner implant sets that we ship from our facility 
for our orthobiologic products  we generally ship directly to hospitals from our facility  and we invoice hospitals upon shipment 
outside the united states  we sell our products directly to distributors who maintain an inventory of our products 
we record revenue at the time of shipment to the distributor at prices reflecting a discount from our us list prices 
the distributors service the surgeons and hospitals  deliver products and invoice hospitals directly at prices determined by the distributors 
because our revenues from us hospitals are primarily at list price  and our revenues from international distributors are at a discount to us list prices  our overall gross margin is subject to fluctuation based on our domestic versus international sales mix  with domestic gross margins being somewhat higher than international gross margins 
additionally  the mix between spinal implant products sales and orthobiologic products sales also affects our gross margins  with higher margins in orthobiologics 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements revenue from sales of product where the customer immediately accepts title is recorded at the time of shipment 
revenue from sales of consigned inventory is recorded upon receipt of written acknowledgement from independent agencies  direct sales representatives or customers that the product has been used in a surgical procedure 
provision is made currently for estimated product returns based on historical experience and other known factors 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
we provide an inventory reserve for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs would be required 
we have significant intangible assets  including goodwill 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we currently have deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets annually

net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   sales of million were million  or  higher than sales of million for the year ended december  the following table presents sales by category in thousands year ended december  change amount percent spinal implant product sales orthobiologic product sales minimally invasive surgery product sales total sales sales of spinal implant products increased in the year ended december  by million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to increased sales of the synergy spinal system  increased sales of our c tek anterior cervical plate system and sales of our recently released geo structure device 
sales of orthobiologic products decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  sales of our synthetic bone graft products decreased by from sales in we believe that the decline in sales of our orthobiologic products has resulted primarily from the focus of our independent agencies on the spinal implant market 
to combat the decline in sales of our orthobiologic products  we recently introduced an allograft putty product  and we plan to introduce access  our improved agf processing system  in the first half of additionally  we are expanding a direct sales force specifically responsible for sales of our orthobiologic products 
we anticipate that these efforts may begin to reverse the decline in sales of our orthobiologic products  however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully introduce access or that access will begin to contribute to our sales or that our efforts to reverse the sales trend will be successful 
sales of mis products increased by million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this product line was acquired in july  and accordingly  the period only included sales since the acquisition 
domestic sales for all product categories increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  international sales for the year ended december  decreased  or  to million from million for the year ended december  beginning in the second quarter of  our revenues will reflect any royalties received from depuy acromed in connection with our patent dispute settlement 
see liquidity and capital resources 
for the year ended december   the gross margin as a percentage of sales was  compared to for the year ended december total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during the same period of as a percentage of net sales  total operating expenses increased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  because the rate of operating expense growth exceeded the sales growth rate 
the greatest operating expense growth occurred in the selling and marketing and general and administrative expense categories 
the selling and marketing expense increase of over reflects our investment in additional sales personnel for our mis products 
additionally  included a full year of mis selling expenses compared to less than a half year of similar expense in general and administrative expenses increased in by million  or  primarily as the result of legal expenses associated with the depuy acromed litigation and increased products liability insurance premiums on higher sales 
also  research and development expenses in increased by  or million  due primarily to efforts related to the development of potential new products and a full year of expenses related to our mis business 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase in  partially in the sales and marketing expense category  with the expansion of our direct sales forces for orthobiologic and mis products 
total interest and other income decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to million for year ended december  the decrease in interest income resulted from lower average cash and cash equivalents balances in because of the significant tax benefit in resulting from tax savings projects undertaken during  we recorded a benefit of  for the year ended december  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
we anticipate that the effective tax rate for the year will be approximately  absent any further tax savings projects 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   sales of million were million  or  higher than sales of million for the previous year 
the following table presents sales by category in thousands year ended december  change amount percent spinal implant product sales orthobiologic product sales minimally invasive surgery product sales total sales sales of spinal implant products increased in the year ended december  by million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to increased sales of the synergy spinal system  and sales of our c tek anterior cervical plate system which was introduced in the first quarter of sales of orthobiologic products decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  sales of our bone graft substitute products decreased by versus we believe that the decreased sales of bone graft substitute products have resulted from the intentional focus of our distribution resources on the spinal surgery market 
sales of our agf related products remained relatively unchanged compared to the year ended december  sales of mis products were million for the year ended december  this product line was acquired in july  as part of the aom acquisition and accordingly  no sales were recorded during domestic sales for all product categories increased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of international sales of million for the year ended december  were higher by or million compared to million for the same period of for the year ended december   the gross margin as a percentage of sales was  compared to for the year ended december  this improvement primarily resulted from operating efficiencies resulting from increased production volumes and higher average unit selling prices for our domestic spinal implant products 
total operating expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  compared to million during the same period of research and development expenses in increased by  or million  due primarily to efforts related to the development of potential new products and expenses related to our mis business 
selling and marketing expenses in increased million  or  compared to  primarily due to commissions on increased sales and expenses related to our mis business 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  in  primarily as the result of legal expenses associated with the depuy acromed litigation and expenses related to our mis business 
total interest and other income was approximately million in both and lower interest income resulted from comparatively lower interest rates and the decrease in cash and cash equivalents associated with the approximately million of cash used in connection with the acquisition of the mis business in july the decrease in interest income was offset by decreased interest expense resulting from the elimination of long term debt in and higher royalty income 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources in  we invested significantly in the development of new spinal implant products and orthobiologic products  some of which were launched in  and others which are scheduled for market launch in in addition to product development costs  we built substantial inventories to support the launch and future sales of these products 
this is especially significant in our spinal implant business  where we must build complete sets of implants in many designs and sizes together with the instruments required for their surgical implantation 
enough complete sets must be manufactured to support consignment inventory needs for our domestic sales agencies and for some us hospitals as well as for loaner sets maintained at our facilities 
as a result  our inventories grew by million in this was the primary reason for our million net cash used in operations for the year ended december  at december   cash and cash equivalents were million  down million from million at december  we have a million secured revolving bank line of credit which expires in june at december   we had borrowed approximately million under this facility to fund our working capital needs 
on january   we received a million payment from depuy acromed in settlement of patent litigation  some of which was used to pay off the outstanding balance on our line of credit 
additionally  the settlement agreement provides that depuy acromed will pay us a royalty on all licensed spinal implants sold in the us after january  we plan to continue making significant investments in initial inventory levels for new products 
we also intend to continue to invest in the development of our business 
we believe we currently possess sufficient resources  including our revolving bank line of credit  to meet the cash requirements of our operations for at least the next year 
in addition  we have used and may continue to use our cash  our common stock  or a combination of both to pay for purchased technologies  product lines  mergers and acquisitions 
some of these activities may require resources in excess of those which we currently possess  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on satisfactory terms  if at all 
at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to our cash and cash equivalent balances and marketable securities 
however  as all of our investments are in short term instruments  we believe that we have no material market risk exposure
