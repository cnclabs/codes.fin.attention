production in the cut bank field commenced with the discovery of oil in the s at an average depth of approximately  feet 
the southwest cut bank sand unit  which is the core of our interest in the field  was originally formed by phillips petroleum company in an initial pilot waterflood program was started in by phillips and eventually encompassed the entire unit with producing wells on and acre spacing 
in the cut bank field  we own an average working interest of in producing oil wells  active injection wells and one active water supply well 
the bears den field was discovered in and has been under waterflood since in the bears den field  we own a working interest in three active water injection wells and five producing oil wells  which produce oil at a depth of approximately  feet 
the rattlers butte field was discovered during in the rattlers butte field  we own a working interest in two oil wells producing at a depth of approximately  feet and one active water injection well 
in nevada  we operate the trap spring and munson ranch fields and have an interest in the bacon flat field  which is operated by an industry partner 
the trap spring field was discovered in in the trap spring field  we produce oil from a depth of approximately  feet from one well  with a working interest of

production costs do not include such items as g a costs  depreciation  depletion  state income taxes or federal income taxes 
we sell oil at posted field prices to one of several purchasers in each of our production areas 
for the first half of and for the years ended december  and  more than of our total oil sales were to cenex  a regional refiner and marketer 
in june  we began selling our montana production  which represents over of our total oil sales  to plains marketing canada lp posted prices are generally competitive among crude oil purchasers 
our crude oil sales contracts may be terminated by either party upon days notice 
oilfield services drilling rig and well servicing equipment in montana  we perform a variety of third party contract oilfield services  including drilling  workovers  location work  cementing and acidizing 
we currently have a drilling rig capable of drilling to a vertical depth of  feet  a workover rig  two service rigs  cementing equipment  acidizing equipment and other associated oilfield servicing equipment 
we first started our oilfield servicing business in in an effort to increase our united states revenues  which had been declining due to the depressed oil prices that had occurred throughout that year 
proved reserves proved reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reserves under existing economic and operating conditions 
our proved oil and gas reserve quantities and values are based on estimates prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission  or sec 
operating costs  production taxes and development costs were deducted in determining the quantity and value information 
such costs were estimated based on current costs and were not adjusted to anticipate increases due to inflation or other factors 
no price escalations were assumed and no amounts were deducted for general overhead  depreciation  depletion and amortization  interest expense and income taxes 
the proved reserve quantity and value information is based on the weighted average price on december   of per bbl for oil in the united states and per mcf of gas in poland 
the determination of oil and gas reserves is based on estimates and is highly complex and interpretive  as there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimated quantities and values of proved reserves  projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the estimated present value  discounted at per annum  of the discounted future net cash flows  or pv value  was determined in accordance with sfas no 
disclosure about oil and gas activities and sec guidelines 
our proved reserve estimates are subject to continuing revisions as additional information becomes available or assumptions change 
estimates of our proved united states oil reserves were prepared by larry krause consulting  an independent engineering firm in billings  montana 
estimates of our proved polish gas reserves were prepared by troy ikoda limited  an independent engineering firm in the united kingdom 
no estimates of our proved reserves have been filed with or included in any report to any other federal agency during the following summary of proved reserve information as of december   represents estimates net to us only and should not be construed as exact united states poland total oil pv value gas pv value pv value mbbls in thousands mmcf in thousands in thousands proved reserves developed producing      undeveloped    total      drilling activities the following table sets forth the exploratory wells that we drilled during the years ended december   and years ended december  gross net gross net gross net discoveries united states poland total exploratory dry holes united states poland total total wells drilled we did not drill any exploratory wells in  and we did not drill any development wells during  or wells and acreage as of december   our producing gross and net well count consisted of the following number of wells gross net well count united states poland total all of our united states wells are producing oil wells

government regulation poland our activities in poland are subject to political  economic and other uncertainties  including the adoption of new laws  regulations or administrative policies that may adversely affect us or the terms of our exploration or production rights  political instability and changes in government or public or administrative policies  export and transportation tariffs and local and national taxes  foreign exchange and currency restrictions and fluctuations  repatriation limitations  inflation  environmental regulations and other matters 
these operations in poland are subject to the geological and mining law dated as of september   and the protection and management of the environment act dated as of january   which are the current primary statutes governing environmental protection 
agreements with the government of poland respecting our areas create certain standards to be met regarding environmental protection 
participants in oil and gas exploration  development and production activities generally are required to adhere to good international petroleum industry practices  including practices relating to the protection of the environment  and prepare and submit geological work plans  with specific attention to environmental matters  to the appropriate agency of state geological administration for its approval prior to engaging in field operations such as seismic data acquisition  exploratory drilling and field wide development 
poland s regulatory framework respecting environmental protection is not as fully developed and detailed as that which exists in the united states 
we intend to conduct our operations in poland in accordance with good international petroleum industry practices and  as they develop  polish requirements 
as poland continues to progress towards its stated goal of becoming a member of the european union  it is expected to pass further legislation aimed at harmonizing polish environmental law with that of the european union 
united states state and local regulation of drilling and production our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  and the plugging and abandoning of wells 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
our oil production is affected to some degree by state regulations 
states in which we operate have statutory provisions regulating the production and sale of oil and gas  including provisions regarding deliverability 
such statutes and related regulations are generally intended to prevent waste of oil and gas and to protect correlative rights to produce oil and gas between owners of a common reservoir 
certain state regulatory authorities also regulate the amount of oil and gas produced by assigning allowable rates of production to each well or proration unit 
environmental regulations the federal government and various state and local governments have adopted laws and regulations regarding the control of contamination of the environment 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit by operators before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations 
these laws and regulations may also increase the costs of drilling and operation of wells 
we may also be held liable for the costs of removal and damages arising out of a pollution incident to the extent set forth in the federal water pollution control act  as amended by the oil pollution act of  or opa in addition  we may be subject to other civil claims arising out of any such incident 
as with any owner of property  we are also subject to clean up costs and liability for hazardous materials  asbestos or any other toxic or hazardous substance that may exist on or under any of our properties 
we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with such laws  rules and regulations and that continued compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
furthermore  we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than our competitors in the oil and gas industry 
the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  or cercla  also known as the superfund law  imposes liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances 
under cercla  such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
furthermore  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
the resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  and regulations promulgated thereunder govern the generation  storage  transfer and disposal of hazardous wastes 
rcra  however  excludes from the definition of hazardous wastes drilling fluids  produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration  development  or production of crude oil  gas or geothermal energy 
because of this exclusion  many of our operations are exempt from rcra regulation 
nevertheless  we must comply with rcra regulations for any of our operations that do not fall within the rcra exclusion 
the opa and related regulations impose a variety of regulations on responsible parties related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opa establishes strict liability for owners of facilities that are the site of a release of oil into waters of the united states 
while opa liability more typically applies to facilities near substantial bodies of water  at least one district court has held that opa liability can attach if the contamination could enter waters that may flow into navigable waters 
stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future  such as proposals made in congress and at the state level from time to time  that would reclassify certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes and make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling  disposal and clean up requirements 
the impact of any such changes  however  would not likely be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated company involved in oil and gas exploration and production 
federal and indian leases a substantial part of our producing properties in montana consist of oil and gas leases issued by the bureau of land management or by the blackfeet tribe under the supervision of the bureau of indian affairs 
these activities must comply with rules and orders that regulate aspects of the oil and gas industry  including drilling and operating on leased land and the calculation and payment of royalties to the federal government or the governing indian nation 
operations on indian lands must also comply with applicable requirements of the governing body of the tribe involved including  in some instances  the employment of tribal members 
we believe we are currently in full compliance with all material provisions of such regulations 
safety and health regulations we must also conduct our operations in accordance with various laws and regulations concerning occupational safety and health 
currently  we do not foresee expending material amounts to comply with these occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
however  since such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the future effect of these laws and regulations 
title to properties we rely on sovereign ownership of exploration rights and mineral interests by the polish government in connection with our activities in poland and have not conducted and do not plan to conduct any independent title examination 
we regularly consult with our polish legal counsel when doing business in poland 
nearly all of our united states working interests are held under leases from third parties 
we typically obtain a title opinion concerning such properties prior to the commencement of drilling operations 
we have obtained such title opinions or other third party review on nearly all of our producing properties  and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all such properties sufficient to meet standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
our united states properties are subject to typical burdens  including customary royalty interests and liens for current taxes  but we have concluded that such burdens do not materially interfere with the use of such properties 
further  we believe the economic effects of such burdens have been appropriately reflected in our acquisition cost of such properties and reserve estimates 
title investigation before the acquisition of undeveloped properties is less thorough than that conducted prior to drilling  as is standard practice in the industry 
employees and consultants as of december   we had employees  consisting of six in salt lake city  utah  in oilmont  montana  one in greenwich  connecticut  and two in houston  texas 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
we also regularly engage technical consultants to provide specific geological  geophysical and other professional services 
offices and facilities our corporate offices  located at highland drive  salt lake city  utah  contain approximately  square feet and are rented at  per month under a month to month agreement 
in montana  we own a  square foot building located at the corner of central and main in oilmont  where we utilize  square feet for our field office and rent the remaining space to unrelated third parties for per month 
in poland  we rent a small office suite for  per month in warsaw  at al

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our historical financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected consolidated financial data  our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in this report 
introduction as of december   we had approximately  of cash and cash equivalents  a working capital deficit of approximately million  and a stockholders deficit of approximately million 
in addition  we have a remaining commitment of million that must be spent by us in addition to payment of the million to pogc  which is included in our accrued liabilities at december   in order to complete our earning obligation in our fences project areas 
these factors cause uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
since december   we have substantially improved our overall financial position and prospects for achieving a sound financial condition by obtaining million in equity funding  reaching new terms respecting our fences obligations  extending our rrpv obligation with revised terms and entering into a farmout agreement with calenergy gas under which it may provide cash and drilling funds of up to million 
our primary obligations through the end of include million principal amount plus interest due rrpv at year end  million plus interest due pogc at year end  million of fences i work commitment  and approximately million for general  administrative and marketing expenses  for a total of approximately million  plus any geological and geophysical costs we may wish to expend 
offsetting these amounts  we have million in available cash and may look forward to other sources of funds including million of work and cash that may be realized under the calenergy farmout agreement  million in accrued kleka production revenue  and an amount to be determined pv value million for the future value of kleka production  for an approximate total of approximately million 
in addition  we have the right to earn a interest in the fences ii project area and anticipate completing documentation soon for a interest in the fences iii project area 
we believe we can arrange with industry partners to trade a portion of our interest in these properties for drilling funds and cash payments that will exceed our related acquisition or earning and any related geological and geophysical costs 
despite our financial condition  we believe these events have substantially improved our ability to continue as a going concern 
private placement of convertible preferred stock on march   we sold  shares of series convertible preferred stock in a private placement of securities  raising a total of million after offering costs 
each share of preferred stock is convertible into one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock at per share anytime between march   and march  the preferred stock has a liquidation preference equal to the sales price for the shares  which was per share 
the net proceeds from the offering  plus our available cash  were used to reduce our obligation to rrpv see discussion of rrpv note amendment below  fund ongoing geological and geophysical costs in poland  and support ongoing prospect marketing and general and administrative costs 
calenergy gas agreement in january  we signed a farmout agreement with calenergy gas holdings ltd  an affiliate of midamerican energy holdings company  for the joint exploration of our fences i project in poland 
under the terms of the agreement  calenergy gas has the right  but not the obligation  to pay of the costs to drill an initial well  and by so doing  will earn a interest of our interest in that drilling prospect 
following the completion of the initial well  calenergy gas may elect to terminate the agreement or to drill a second well 
if calenergy gas elects to drill a second well  it will pay us million prior to drilling 
calenergy gas will pay of the costs to drill a second well to earn interest in that prospect 
following the second well  calenergy gas has the option to acquire of our interest of the entire fences project area by paying to us the sum of million  less the costs of drilling the first two wells and less the cost of any additional geological and geophysical costs it has incurred on the fences area 
any such payment to us is pledged to rrpv  until its note  with a principal balance of approximately million  plus interest  has been satisfied in full 
we expect the net proceeds to us to be approximately million before the end of  from which we will be obligated to pay rrpv 
all of the costs related to our interest in the project area that are paid for by calenergy gas will be credited against the remaining million obligation under our million work obligation to pogc see below 
calenergy gas has received consent from pogc concerning the transfer of our working interest according to the agreement terms  and rrpv has committed to permit the transfer  free of any lien or encumbrance  of of our interest to calenergy gas 
we expect drilling to commence in the second quarter of fences i settlement agreement on april   we agreed to spend million of exploration costs on the fences project areas to earn a interest 
when expenditures exceed million  pogc will pay its share of further costs 
through the end of  we had paid million towards the million commitment 
as of december   we had accrued  of additional costs pertaining to the fences project areas 
in late  as part of our discussions with pogc concerning the calenergy gas agreement and the opportunity to participate with pogc in other exploration projects  we reaffirmed our intent to fulfill the million commitment with pogc 
in connection with this agreement  we agreed to recognize in  and pay at a future date  an additional million of costs related to prior exploration activities in the fences project areas to pogc  million of which will be credited towards the million commitment 
the amount includes  in interest costs related to our prior liabilities to pogc   in drilling costs   in pipeline costs   in seismic costs  and  related to foreign exchange adjustments 
in addition  as part of our future payments towards the remaining commitment  we have agreed to assign in  as soon as is practicable  all of our rights to the kleka well  including the amounts recorded as accounts receivable for kleka gas sales 
accordingly  at december   our receivable from pogc in the amount of  was offset against the pogc liability 
the liability will be further offset in by the value of the remaining gas reserves associated with the kleka well  as determined by an independent engineer 
lastly  we agreed to begin accruing interest on the past due amount to pogc 
the interest rate in effect at december   was per annum  the interest rate as of march   was 
rolls royce power ventures in early  we reached an agreement with rrpv to amend its convertible secured note in the amount of million see footnote in the financial statements 
our current liabilities at december   include the million principal balance  plus accrued interest of  the note is secured by a lien on our fences i and wilga property interests and was repayable in march  unless converted to common stock at per share or otherwise amended 
in march  following our successful private placement of convertible preferred stock  we paid million to rrpv 
in return  rrpv extended the maturity date of the note to december  we have also agreed to pay of the gross proceeds of any subsequent equity or debt offering concluded prior to the amended maturity date to rrpv 
we also agreed to assign our rights to payments under the calenergy gas agreement to rrpv  except for those amounts related to drilling the two wells 
all such payments will be used to offset the remaining principal and interest 
in exchange for these payments  rrpv agreed to release its lien on interests earned by calenergy gas under its agreement with us 
the loan amendment contains other terms and conditions  including an increase in the interest rate on the note from to per annum effective march   an extension of the conversion period until december   with the conversion price being changed from per share to per share  and an extension fee payment of  cost reduction measures in mid  we recognized that it would likely require an extended period to consummate a farmout transaction with our fences i project and our ability to raise additional equity debt would be restricted until such an arrangement was in place 
we further recognized the importance of reducing our overhead expenses to conserve cash while in discussions with potential partners 
effective july   we undertook several measures to reduce our ongoing expenses 
we cut the salaries of all key employees by and did not replace employees who left the company 
we also reduced the level of benefits available to all employees 
we cut other areas of overhead expenses where possible 
in addition to our overhead reductions  we significantly reduced the amount of money designated for ongoing seismic and other exploration costs 
summary despite our financial condition  because of the events described above  we believe that we are well positioned to obtain additional funding and continue as a going concern 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing or successfully complete the necessary steps to enable us to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future cash requirements  we may be forced to curtail operations further  dispose of assets  issue securities to meet obligations  or seek extended payment terms from our creditors 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations and result in the dilution of the interests of existing stockholders 
critical accounting policies oil and gas activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if an exploratory well has not found proved reserves  these costs plus the costs of drilling the well are expensed 
the costs of development wells are capitalized  whether productive or nonproductive 
geological and geophysical costs on exploratory prospects and the costs of carrying and retaining unproved properties are expensed as incurred 
an impairment allowance is provided to the extent that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are considered not to be realizable 
an impairment loss is recorded if the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties exceed the aggregate undiscounted future net cash flows determined on a property by property basis 
the impairment loss recognized equals the excess of net capitalized costs over the related fair value  determined on a property by property basis 
as a result of the foregoing  our results of operations for any particular period may not be indicative of the results that could be expected over longer periods 
oil and gas reserves engineering estimates of our oil and gas reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the subjective judgments involved in developing such information 
there are authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that have to be met before estimated oil and gas reserves can be designated as proved 
proved reserve estimates are updated at least annually and take into account recent production and technical information about each field 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also changes 
this change is considered a change in estimate for accounting purposes and is reflected on a prospective basis in related depreciation rates 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  these estimates are used in determining depreciation expense and impairment expense and in disclosing the supplemental standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas properties 
depreciation rates are determined based on estimated proved reserve quantities the denominator and capitalized costs of producing properties the numerator 
producing properties capitalized costs are amortized based on the units of oil or gas produced 
therefore  assuming all other variables are held constant  an increase in estimated proved reserves decreases our depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
also  estimated reserves are often used to calculate future cash flows from our oil and gas operations  which serve as an indicator of fair value in determining whether a property is impaired or not 
the larger the estimated reserves  the less likely the property is impaired 
results of operations by business segment we operate within two segments of the oil and gas industry the exploration and production segment  or e p  and the oilfield services segment 
direct revenues and costs  including depreciation  depletion and amortization costs  or dd a  general and administrative costs  or g a  and other income directly associated with their respective segments are detailed within the following discussion 
dd a  g a  amortization of deferred compensation g a  interest income  other income  interest expense  impairment of notes receivable from officers and other costs  which are not allocated to individual operating segments for management or segment reporting purposes  are discussed in their entirety following the segment discussion 
a comparison of the results of operations by business segment and the information regarding nonsegmented items for the years ended december   and  respectively  follows 
further information concerning our business segments can be found in note  business segments  in the financial statements 
exploration and production segment a summary of the amount and percentage change  as compared to their respective prior year period  for oil and gas revenues  average oil and gas prices  oil and gas production volumes  and lifting costs per barrel and mcf for the years ended december   and  is set forth in the following table for the year ended december  oil gas oil gas oil gas revenues      percent change versus prior year average price bbls or mcf percent change versus prior year production volumes bbls or mcf      percent change versus prior year lifting costs per bbls or mcf 
percent change versus prior year the contract price for gas during and  prior to adjusting for actual physical content of btu  was per mmbtu 
lifting costs per barrel are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total barrels of oil produced after royalties 
lifting costs per mcf of gas are computed by dividing the related lease operating expenses by the total mcf of gas produced before royalties 
lifting costs do not include production taxes 
oil revenues 
oil revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
essentially all oil revenues during the three years were derived from our producing properties in the united states 
during these three years  oil revenues fluctuated primarily due to volatile oil prices  the degree of maintenance performed  and the declining production rates attributable to the natural production declines of our producing properties 
gas revenues 
our gas revenues are derived solely from our polish producing operations 
gas revenues were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no gas revenues during the kleka  our first producing well in poland  began producing during february during and  gas produced by the kleka was sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing under a five year contract  which may be terminated by giving pogc a day written notice 
the decline in gas production from to is the result of the operator choking back the well to avoid any increase in water production 
lease operating costs 
lease operating costs were million for each of the years ended december   and operating costs rose slightly from to  as higher oil lifting costs offset lower oil and gas production 
operating costs rose from levels in due to the commencement of production from the kleka well in poland  as well as higher per unit oil lifting costs 
exploration costs 
our exploration efforts are focused in poland  and the expenses consist of geological and geophysical costs  or g g costs  exploratory dry holes and oil and gas leasehold impairments 
exploration costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
limited available capital in caused us to sharply curtail our exploration activities in poland 
subject to the commencement of drilling activities under the calenergy gas agreement and our ability secure additional equity debt financing  exploration costs will continue to be curtailed in the near term 
g g costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  most of our g g costs were spent on reprocessing and further analyzing the seismic data on the fences i area 
during  we spent approximately million on acquiring d seismic data in the fences project areas   acquiring and analyzing d seismic data on the pomeranian project area  and granted stock options valued at  to a polish consultant 
during  we spent approximately million on acquiring d seismic data in the fences project areas  approximately  on acquiring and analyzing d seismic data on the lublin basin  pomeranian and warsaw west project areas  and granted stock options valued at approximately  to a polish consultant 
under terms of the poland agreement credit  apache covered our share of additional g g costs totaling  and  during and  respectively 
exploratory dry hole costs were  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
due to our capital limitations  we did not participate in any exploratory drilling in during  we incurred costs of million pertaining to the mieszkow well on the fences project areas 
in accordance with fasb no 
 we have classified the mieszkow as an exploratory dry hole for financial reporting purposes  because further operations have been suspended since drilling  pending the reprocessing and interpretation of d seismic data in order to evaluate the economic feasibility of additional drilling operations at the well site 
during  we drilled the wilga and wilga wells near our wilga discovery on the wilga project area  both of which were subsequently determined to be exploratory dry holes 
the two wells cost a net amount of million and  respectively  after apache covered one half of our share of drilling costs under terms of the apache exploration program 
impairments of oil and gas properties were million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we incurred an impairment of  in costs associated with the tuchola well 
a preliminary open hole test in early january on the well resulted in a flow rate of mmcf of gas per day from the main dolomite reef formation at a depth between  meters and  meters 
the flow rate was limited by the capacity of the surface equipment 
the well was subsequently completed in an approximately foot thick section of the main dolomite  but has since been shut in pending a pipeline connection 
constrained capital has prevented us from drilling the additional appraisal and development wells and building the necessary infrastructure  and fasb no 
requires well costs to be impaired if more than one year elapses from drilling to production 
we also recognized an impairment of million in costs associated with the kleka well  where lower production profiles caused a downward revision in recoverable future reserves 
during  we incurred impairments of  for the baltic project area and  for the warsaw west project area  both of which are located in poland in areas where we no longer have exploration plans 
during  we incurred impairments of  for the williston basin in north dakota  where we also no longer have exploration plans 
impairments will vary from period to period based on our determination that capitalized costs of unproved properties  on a property by property basis  are not realizable 
apache poland g a costs 
apache poland g a costs consist of our share of direct overhead costs incurred by apache in poland in accordance with the terms of the apache exploration program 
apache poland g a costs were   and  for the years ended december   and during mid  we began to narrow the focus of our ongoing exploratory efforts relating to the apache exploration program by including only the pomeranian and wilga project areas and discontinued our exploratory activities on the lublin basin  warsaw west and carpathian project areas 
prior to july   apache covered all of our pro rata share of apache poland g a costs 
effective july   we began paying approximately of apache poland g a costs  to be adjusted as each of apache s remaining drilling requirements were completed 
apache has since completed its remaining drilling requirements  and we are now responsible only for our share of apache poland g a costs relating to ongoing  jointly conducted activities in the wilga project area in poland for which apache is the operator  subject to a preapproved annual budget 
in addition to the above amounts  apache covered our share of additional apache poland g a costs totaling  and  during and  respectively  under terms of the poland agreement credit 
poland agreement credit 
under an amendment to the apache exploration program effective january   referred to as the poland agreement  apache agreed to issue to us a credit that included apache covering  of our share of joint costs in poland other than carried costs in return for the release of apache s commitment to cover our share of costs to shoot kilometers of d seismic data in the carpathian project area 
during and  we used the entire poland agreement credit  as shown below poland agreement credit total cost category geological and geophysical costs    exploratory dry hole costs    apache poland general and administrative costs    leasehold costs   tuchola completion costs   total    dd a expense producing operations 
dd a expense for producing properties was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
dd a expense incurred during and includes approximately  and  respectively  or per mcf of gas produced  associated solely with the kleka well that began producing in poland during february dd a expense declined from to due to reduced production from the well 
there was no dd a expense associated with poland during the dd a rate per barrel for oil produced in the united states was  and during  and  respectively 
the differences between the dd a rates per barrel from year to year are primarily the result of changes in oil reserve estimates computed as of december of each year 
oilfield services segment oilfield services revenues 
oilfield services revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
oilfield services revenues increased from to due to improved market conditions and an increased emphasis on using our oilfield servicing equipment for contract third party services rather than servicing company owned properties 
conversely  the contract drilling industry was significantly curtailed in the area where we operate in  and our revenues declined sharply as a result 
oilfield services revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period based on market demand  weather  the number of wells drilled  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties and other factors 
oilfield servicing costs 
oilfield services costs were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  or  and of oilfield servicing revenues  respectively 
oilfield services costs as a percentage of oilfield services revenues were relatively flat during  as compared to during  oilfield servicing costs were a higher percentage of oilfield services revenues  as compared to  due to increased maintenance and repair costs associated with our oilfield servicing equipment 
in general  oilfield servicing costs are directly associated with oilfield services revenues 
as such  oilfield services costs will continue to fluctuate period to period based on the number of wells drilled  revenues generated  weather  downtime for equipment repairs  the degree of emphasis on using our oilfield services equipment on our company owned properties and other factors 
dd a expense oilfield services 
dd a expense for oilfield services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we spent   and  on upgrading our oilfield servicing equipment during  and  respectively 
nonsegmented items amortization of deferred compensation g a 
amortization of deferred compensation was  million and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
on april   we extended the term of options to purchase  shares of our common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period 
on august   we extended the term of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock that were to expire during for a period of two years  with a one year vesting period 
in accordance with fin accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  we incurred noncash deferred compensation costs of million  including  for the april   option extension and million for the august   option extension  to be amortized over their respective one year vesting periods from the date of extension 
the deferred costs have all been amortized as of december  g a costs corporate 
g a costs were million   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  g a costs were million lower than g a costs  primarily due to the company writing off million of compensation that was accrued as of december  without the write offs  g a costs during would have been approximately million 
during  in recognition of our limited resources  we aggressively pursued the cost reduction measures described earlier  resulting in costs lower than  excluding the million write off during that year  and actual costs 
interest and other income corporate 
interest and other income was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash  cash equivalent and marketable debt securities balances were million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
lower cash balances and interest rates in and reduced our interest income in both years 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded other income of  and  respectively  pertaining to amortizing an option premium resulting from granting rrpv an option to purchase gas from our properties in poland 
interest expense 
interest expense was million   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  and  we recorded  and  respectively  of imputed interest expense relating to our financing arrangement with rrpv 
on march   we began to accrue interest on the million rrpv obligation at an annual rate of 
impairment of notes receivable 
impairment of notes receivable was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the notes receivable carrying value must be adjusted at the end of each reporting period to reflect the market value of the underlying collateral 
on november   a former employee exercised an option to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the former employee elected to pay for the cost of the exercise by signing a full recourse promissory note with us for  terms of the note receivable included a three year term with annual principal payments of  plus interest accrued at 
on november   the former employee surrendered  shares of our common stock in return for cancellation of the note receivable 
we recorded a loss of  on the transaction and the acquisition of  shares of common stock at a price of per share  the closing price of our stock on november  also during  two of our officers surrendered collateral shares to us in return for the cancellation of the notes receivable from those officers that were outstanding on december  the officers notes included principal and interest of million reduced by a cumulative impairment allowance of million based on the market value of  shares of the our common stock held as collateral 
as a result of the transaction  we recorded the acquisition of  shares of treasury stock at a cost of  there were no notes receivable or related impairments thereof in income taxes 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
sfas no 
accounting for income taxes requires that a valuation allowance be provided if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our ability to realize the benefit of our deferred tax asset will depend on the generation of future taxable income through profitable operations and the expansion of our exploration and development activities 
the market and capital risks associated with achieving the above requirement are considerable  resulting in our conclusion that a full valuation allowance be provided 
accordingly  we did not recognize any income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations for these years 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately  of cash and cash equivalents  a working capital deficit of approximately million  and a stockholders deficit of approximately million 
in addition  we have a remaining work commitment of million that must be spent by us in addition to payment of the million to pogc  which is included in our accrued liabilities at december  in order to complete our earning obligation in our fences project areas 
our financial position as of december   raises uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we have made significant progress in several areas toward improving our liquidity and capital resources discussed in detail at the beginning of this md a section 
we raised million from the recent sale of equity securities  we extended the due dates on the rrpv note and the accrued liability to pogc  we arranged to reduce our liability to pogc by the value of our interest in the kleka well  and we signed a farmout agreement with calenergy gas that  if calenergy gas fully earns half our interest in fences i  will result in million of work commitments performed and cash paid to us 
in addition  we recently obtained the right to earn a interest in the fences ii project area and anticipate completing documentation soon for a interest in the fences iii project area 
we believe we can arrange with industry partners to trade a portion of our interest in these properties for drilling funds and cash payments that will exceed our related costs 
although  notwithstanding these measures  there remains uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern  we believe the prospect of eliminating that uncertainty during the current year has been substantially improved 
to date  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of equity securities  issuance of debt securities  and agreements with industry partners that funded our share of costs in certain exploratory activities in order to earn an interest in our properties 
the continuation of our exploratory efforts in poland is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital or to farm out our properties 
the availability of such capital or farmouts will affect the timing  pace  scope and amount of our future capital expenditures 
if we are unable to arrange farmouts for the fences ii and fences ii project areas  or having done so  if the results of operations there are disappointing  or if calenergy gas s drilling program is unsuccessful  or if calenergy gas elects not to pursue that drilling program  or if other disappointing events should occur  there can be no assurance that we will be able to secure additional partners or obtain additional equity or debt financing 
we may also not be able to further reduce expenses or successfully complete other steps to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient funds to satisfy our future cash requirements  we may be forced to curtail operations  dispose of assets  or seek extended payment terms from our vendors 
such events would materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
we may seek to obtain additional funds for future capital investments from strategic alliances with other energy or financial partners  the sale of additional securities  project financing  sale of partial property interests  or other arrangements  all of which may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project financed 
we may change the allocation of capital among the categories of anticipated expenditures depending upon future events that we cannot predict 
for example  we may change the allocation of our expenditures based on the actual results and costs of future exploration  appraisal  development  production  property acquisition and other activities 
in addition  we may have to change our anticipated expenditures if costs of placing any particular discovery into production are higher  if the field is smaller  or if the commencement of production takes longer than expected 
working capital current assets less current liabilities 
our working capital was million as of december   a decrease of million from december  in accordance with the terms of our rrpv loan agreement  the entire principal amount of million  plus accrued interest  was due on march   unless rrpv earlier converted the loan to restricted common stock at per share  the market value of our common stock at the time the terms with rrpv were finalized 
accordingly  the entire balance of the rrpv note  along with interest accrued through december   is shown as a current liability on the balance sheet 
as discussed above  we reached an agreement with rrpv to extend the maturity date of the loan until december  our current liabilities also include million of costs related to our fences project in poland 
in  we agreed to spend million of exploration costs on this project area  which is owned and operated by pogc  in order to earn a interest 
as of december   we have made cash payments of approximately million pertaining to the required million  in addition to the amount accrued at year end 
operating activities 
we used net cash of million  million and million in our operating activities during  and  respectively  primarily as a result of the net losses incurred in those years 
the declining use of cash in operations is also a reflection of a systematic reduction in exploration costs  as our resources have become limited over time 
investing activities 
we used net cash of  in investing activities during  received net cash of  from our investing activities during  and used net cash of million in investing activities during during  the bulk of cash used was for upgrading our producing oil and gas properties and our well servicing equipment 
during  our capital expenditures for producing properties and well servicing equipment were offset by million in maturing marketable debt securities 
during  we spent million on various additions to both proved and unproved properties  and spent  on additions to oilfield servicing equipment 
we also received a net of million net from transactions in marketable debt securities 
financing activities 
we received net cash of  million and million from our financing activities during  and  respectively 
during  we received million pertaining to our rrpv loan and gas purchase option agreement 
also  during  we acquired  shares of common stock at a cost of  in a noncash transaction 
during  we received net proceeds of million million gross from the private placement of  shares of our common stock  and received  in cash and  in the form of a full recourse promissory note secured by  shares of our common stock from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
also  during  we acquired  shares of treasury stock at a cost of  in a noncash transaction contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of december  in thousands contractual obligations and commitments due by december  in thousands note payable rrpv  plus interest fences i work commitment  cash payment to pogc  plus interest total  plus interest in march  we paid rrpv million  which reduced the balance due to approximately million  plus interest 
the fences i work commitment and the cash payment to pogc are required in order for us to meet our commitment to earn a interest in the fences i project area 
our oil and gas drilling and production operations are subject to hazards incidental to the industry that can cause severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations  personal injury and loss of life 
to lessen the effects of these hazards  we maintain insurance of various types to cover our united states operations and rely on the insurance or financial capabilities of our exploration partners in poland 
these measures do not cover risks related to violations of environmental laws or all other risks involved in oil and gas exploration  drilling and production 
we would be adversely affected by a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance or by our inability to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
risk factors our business is subject a number of material risks  including the following o our success depends on our discovery of commercial quantities of oil or gas in poland 
to date in poland  our exploration efforts have resulted in one producing well the kleka  which we have recently agreed to transfer to pogc  two discoveries the wilga and tuchola  both shut in  and exploratory dry holes 
our success will depend on our ability to generate drilling prospects that result in the discovery of commercial quantities of oil or gas and the establishment of reserves 
we cannot predict whether any prospect we identify may contain reserves  whether we can assemble the financial and other resources to complete drilling or other exploration  or whether any gas or oil we discover can be produced and marketed commercially 
o we will continue to require additional capital 
we will rely principally on proceeds from the sale of securities and farmout or other industry sharing arrangements for planned exploration  appraisal  development and property acquisition programs in poland 
obtaining additional financing may dilute the interest of our existing stockholders or our interest in the specific project being financed 
we cannot assure that additional funds could be obtained or  if obtained  would be on terms favorable to us 
o funding activities may limit our activities 
our capital expenditure budget for for the payment of pogc  completion of earning requirements in fences i  repayment of rrpv  geophysical and geological work  and prospect marketing and other operating costs exceeds our current resources 
therefore  we will be able to complete our planned activities only if we are able to obtain additional financing 
if we cannot obtain required additional financing  we may be forced to curtail our activities sharply in order to continue 
o our loan agreement with rrpv restricts our flexibility 
we have encumbered certain of our property interests in poland to secure repayment of the remaining million balance  plus interest  due rrpv by december  unless converted to common stock at per share  we may have to raise additional capital to repay the loan 
the loan will have to be repaid notwithstanding our other cash requirements or the potentially greater financial return from other expenditures 
in addition  our agreements with rrpv contain financial and operating covenants that are customary for transactions of this nature  including limitations on additional indebtedness 
our agreement with rrpv also specifies usual and customary events of default 
o we face a number of other risks  including continuing world political instability and the threat or existence of armed hostilities involving the united states and major oil and gas producers may adversely affect our ability to obtain required financing  enter into farmout or other exploration arrangements with industry partners  or complete planned exploration 
the exploration models  tools and concepts we are applying in poland have not been fully tested in that geological setting  which increases exploration risk and cost 
we cannot accurately predict the oil or gas potential of any prospect  test or discovery 
we will continue to be dependent on the technical expertise and financial resources of our exploration partners in poland  particularly calenergy gas and pogc  who act as the operators of specific projects 
our activities in poland are subject to uncertainties related to its governmental policies and poland s continuing economic growth and the implementation of its long term privatization strategy 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning january  the most significant impact of this standard to us will be a change in the method of accruing for site restoration costs 
under sfas no 
 the fair value of asset retirement obligations will be recorded as liabilities when they are incurred  which are typically at the time the assets are installed 
amounts recorded for the related assets will be increased by the amount of these obligations 
over time  the liabilities will be accreted for the change in their present value and the capitalized costs will be depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liabilities recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
as we will continue to account for stock based compensation according to apb  adoption of sfas no 
will require us to provide prominent disclosures about the effects of sfas no 
on reported income and will require disclosure of these affects in the interim financial statements as well 
sfas no 
is effective for the financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   and subsequent interim periods 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our operating results and financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which expands on the accounting guidance of statements nos 
  and and incorporates without change the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 which is being superseded 
this interpretation requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
in addition  guarantors are required to make significant new disclosures  even if the likelihood of the guarantor making payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation s disclosure requirements are effective for the company as of december  the recognition requirements of fin are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has no significant guarantees and the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity and determine when the assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and results of operations of a variable interest entity need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the variable interest entity is such that the company will absorb a majority of the variable interest entity s expected losses and or receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective upon issuance 
as of december   the company did not have any variable interest entities that will be subject to fin we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet adopted  accounting standards in order to determine their effects  if any  on our results of operations or financial position 
based on that review  we believe that none of these pronouncements will have a significant effect on current or future earnings or operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s price risk realized pricing for our oil production in the united states is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price of oil  subject to gravity and other adjustments for the actual oil sold 
historically  oil prices have been volatile and unpredictable 
price volatility relating to our oil production in the united states is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
our gas production in poland is currently being sold to pogc based on us dollar pricing under a five year contract that may be terminated by us with a day written notice 
the limited volume and single source of our gas production means we cannot assure uninterruptible production or production in amounts that would be meaningful to industrial users  which may depress the price we may be able to obtain 
there is currently no competitive market for the sale of gas in poland 
accordingly  we expect that the prices we receive for the gas we produce will be lower than would be the case in a competitive setting and may be lower than prevailing western european prices  at least until a fully competitive market develops in poland 
we currently do not engage in any hedging activities or have any derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves against market risks associated with oil and gas price fluctuations  although we may elect to do so if we achieve a significant amount of production in poland 
foreign currency risk we have entered into various agreements in poland  primarily in us dollars or the us dollar equivalent of the polish zloty 
we conduct our day to day business on this basis as well 
the polish zloty is subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond our control 
we do not currently engage in hedging transactions to protect ourselves against foreign currency risks  nor do we intend to do so in the foreseeable future
