item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
general we operate institutes in states which provide technology oriented postsecondary education to more than  students 
we derive our revenue almost entirely from tuition  course materials  fees and charges paid by  or on behalf of  our students 
most students at our institutes pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses with funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs  especially the federal student financial aid programs under title iv title iv programs of the higher education act of  as amended the hea 
in  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenues  determined on a cash accounting basis as defined by the ed s regulations  from title iv programs 
our revenue varies based on the aggregate student population  which is influenced by the following factors the number of students attending our institutes at the beginning of a fiscal period  the number of new first time students entering and former students re entering our institutes during a fiscal period  student retention rates  and general economic conditions 
new students generally enter our institutes at the beginning of an academic quarter that begins for most programs of study in march  june  september or december 
we believe that  in the absence of countervailing factors  student enrollments and retention rates tend to increase as opportunities for immediate employment decline and decrease as such opportunities increase 
our establishment of new institutes and the introduction of additional program offerings at our existing institutes have been significant factors in increasing the aggregate student population in recent years 
in order to participate in title iv programs  a new institute must be authorized by the state in which it will operate  accredited by an accrediting commission that the us department of education ed recognizes  and certified by the ed to participate in title iv programs 
the accrediting commission that accredits our institutes grants accreditation to a new institute prior to its first class start date 
the ed s certification process cannot commence until the institute receives its state authorization and accreditation 
ed certification for a new location has generally taken approximately nine months from the first class start date 
the ed is currently investigating our method of compensation for employees involved in student recruitment 
the hea prohibits an institution participating in title iv programs from providing any commission  bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity 
prior to november  the ed s regulations implementing this provision of the hea repeated almost verbatim the language of the hea  and the ed s interpretations of this provision were inconsistent and generally not publicly disseminated 
in november  after re examining congress original intent and purposes in enacting this hea provision  the ed revised its regulations to clarify its interpretation of this provision and set forth types of activities and payment arrangements that an institution may carry out without violating this provision the safe harbors 
one of the safe harbors permits the payment of fixed compensation  such as a fixed annual salary or hourly wage 
the fixed compensation may not be adjusted up or down more than twice during any month period  and any adjustment to the fixed compensation cannot be based solely on the number of students recruited  admitted  enrolled or awarded financial aid 
prior to november  we believe that we compensated our employees involved in student recruitment  admissions or financial aid in accordance with this safe harbor 
the regulations issued in november become effective july   but any institution may elect to implement the regulations at any date on or after november  we cannot assure you that the ed will not find any deficiencies in our method of compensation  but we believe that our method of compensation has always complied with the hea provision and both the ed s original and revised implementing regulations 
if the ed determines that our method of compensation for employees involved in student recruitment violates this provision of the hea  the ed could subject us to monetary fines or penalties including repaying a substantial portion of the title iv program funds that we disbursed during the last several years or other sanctions including a limitation  suspension or termination of our ability to participate in title iv programs 
any substantial restrictions on our itt technical institutes ability to participate in title iv programs would adversely affect our ability to enroll students  expand the number of our institutes and increase the number of the programs of study offered at our institutes 
in august  the ed advised us that  during the pendency of its investigation  it would not approve any application submitted by any itt technical institute with respect to any change of ownership  additional location  certification of initial or continuing eligibility  or extension of course or program offerings such as raising the level of programs offered at an institution 
during december and january  however  the ed recertified all of our itt technical institute campus groups to participate in title iv programs 
in addition  as part of the recertification  the ed approved a five itt technical institutes as new additional locations of existing main campuses and b an increase in the level of program offerings from associate degree to bachelor degree at one of our campus groups 
in the third quarter of  the ed also approved a two itt technical institutes as new additional locations of existing main campuses and b an increase in the level of program offerings from associate degree to bachelor degree at two of our campus groups 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that the ed will  during the pendency of its investigation  approve any further applications submitted by any itt technical institute with respect to any change of ownership  additional location  certification of initial or continuing eligibility or extension of course or program offerings 
a material adverse effect on our expansion plans  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would result if the ed s restrictions are not lifted prior to we cannot assure you that the ed will lift its restrictions prior to or that the ed will not place additional or other more severe restrictions on our itt technical institutes ability to participate in title iv programs 
we earn tuition revenue on a weekly basis  pro rata over the length of each of four  week academic quarters in each fiscal year 
state regulations  accrediting commission criteria and our policies generally require us to refund a portion of the tuition and fee payments received from a student who withdraws from one of our institutes during an academic quarter 
prior to october   the ed regulations also imposed refund requirements for student tuition and fees 
our statement of income recognizes immediately the amount of tuition and fees  if any  that we may retain after payment of any refund 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
effective january   we implemented sab and changed the method by which we recognize the laboratory and admission processing fees charged to a student as revenue 
we began recognizing those fees as revenue on a straight line basis over the average student s program length of months 
previously  we recognized the quarterly laboratory fee as revenue at the beginning of each academic quarter and the admission processing fee as revenue when we received the fee 
we recorded the cumulative effect of the change in accounting as a one time charge of million  net of taxes  in the three months ended march  we incur expenses throughout a fiscal period in connection with the operation of our institutes 
the cost of educational services includes faculty and administrative salaries  cost of course materials  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization of equipment costs  facilities and leasehold improvements  and certain other administrative costs incurred by our institutes 
student services and administrative expenses include direct marketing costs which are marketing expenses directly related to new student recruitment  indirect marketing expenses  an allowance for doubtful accounts and administrative expenses incurred at our corporate headquarters 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits for recruiting representatives and direct solicitation advertising expenses 
we capitalize our direct marketing costs excluding advertising expenses using the successful efforts method and amortize them on an accelerated basis over the average course length of months commencing on the class start date 
we expense as incurred our marketing costs that do not relate to the direct solicitation of potential students 
marketable debt securities have maturity dates in excess of days at the time of purchase and we record them at their market value 
we include debt securities with original maturity dates of less than days in cash and cash equivalents and record such securities at cost which approximates market value 
we estimate that the market risk associated with our investments in marketable debt securities can best be measured by a potential decrease in the fair value of these securities resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
if such a hypothetical increase in rates were to occur  the reduction in the market value of our portfolio of securities would not be material 
in  we began offering our information technology it curricula at three itt technical institutes 
we began offering our it curricula at an additional itt technical institutes in  at an additional itt institutes in and at an additional one itt technical institute in the three months ended march  we incur a loss with respect to the it curricula offerings at each itt technical institute  until the revenue from the number of students enrolled in the it curricula offerings at that institute is high enough to offset the costs associated with that curricula such as salaries  equipment depreciation  rent and marketing  which typically has not occurred until the it curricula has been offered for three or four quarters 
the initial amount of capital required to offer our it curricula at an existing itt technical institute is approximately million 
in  we began offering a computer and electronics engineering technology ceet program at itt technical institutes and a computer drafting and design cdd program at itt technical institutes 
in  we began offering the ceet program at an additional itt technical institutes and the cdd program at an additional itt technical institutes 
in  we developed five new resident bachelor degree programs and one new online bachelor degree program 
we began offering one or more of these new bachelor degree programs at of our institutes in in addition  a total of of our institutes were approved to offer bachelor degree programs as of december  compared to as of december  we opened two new institutes in  one new institute in and four new institutes in we plan to open three new institutes in our new institutes have historically incurred a loss during the month period after the first class start date 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates and judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies should be read in conjunction with note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
we include all property and equipment in the financial statements at cost 
provisions for depreciation of property and equipment have generally been made using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax purposes 
the estimated useful lives for our furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements generally range from three to ten years 
the estimated useful lives for the buildings that are part of our facilities generally range from to years 
we apply the american institute of certified public accountants the aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the estimated useful lives for our capitalized software generally range from three to eight years 
maintenance  repairs and renewals not of a capital nature are expensed as incurred 
fully depreciated assets no longer in use are removed from both the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts in the year of their retirement 
any gains or losses on dispositions are credited or charged to income  as appropriate 
changes in circumstances  such as changes in our curricula and technological advances  may result in the actual useful lives of our property  equipment and capitalized software differing from our estimates 
we regularly review and evaluate the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment and capitalized software 
although we believe our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from our assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
recognition of revenues 
tuition revenues are recorded on a straight line basis over the length of the applicable course 
if a student discontinues training  the tuition revenue related to the remainder of that academic quarter is recorded with the amount of refund resulting from the application of federal  state or accreditation requirements or our refund policy recorded as an expense 
on an individual student basis  tuition earned in excess of cash received is recorded as accounts receivable  and cash received in excess of tuition earned is recorded as deferred revenue 
textbook sales and the related cost of the textbooks are recognized at the beginning of each academic quarter with respect to students who are attending courses in which textbooks are charged separately from tuition 
for those students who are attending courses in which the cost of textbooks is included in the tuition  the cost of the textbooks is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable course length and the deferral of textbook costs is recorded in prepaids and other current assets 
academic fees which are charged only one time to students on their first day of class attendance  application fees and laboratory fees are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the average course length of months 
if a student discontinues training  all unrecognized revenue relating to his or her fees is recognized upon the student s departure 
more than of our revenues represent tuition charges and less than of our revenues represent bookstore sales and student fees 
the amount of tuition earned depends on the cost per credit hour of the courses in the program  the number of courses in the program  how long a student remains enrolled in the program  how many program courses a student takes during each period of enrollment in the program  and the total number of students enrolled in each program 
each of these factors is known at the time our tuition revenues are calculated and is not subject to estimation 
direct marketing costs 
direct costs incurred relating to the enrollment of new students are capitalized using the successful efforts method 
direct marketing costs include salaries and employee benefits of recruiting representatives and other direct costs less admission processing fees 
successful efforts is the ratio of students enrolled to prospective students interviewed 
direct marketing costs are amortized on an accelerated basis over the average course length of months commencing on the class start date 
the higher the rate of interviewed students who enroll  the greater the percentage of our direct marketing costs that are capitalized 
the direct costs subject to capitalization are readily quantifiable and are not subject to estimation 
the amortization method is based on historical trends of student enrollment activity and is not subject to significant assumptions 
we regularly evaluate the future recoverability of these deferred costs 
variations in quarterly results of operations our quarterly results of operations have tended to fluctuate within a fiscal year due to the timing of student matriculations 
each of our four fiscal quarters have weeks of earned tuition revenue 
revenues in our third and fourth fiscal quarters generally benefit from increased student matriculations 
the number of new students entering our institutes tends to be substantially higher in june of all new students in and september of all new students in because of the significant number of recent high school graduates entering our institutes for the academic quarters beginning in those two months 
the academic schedule generally does not affect our incurrence of costs  however  and costs do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
the following table sets forth our revenues in each fiscal quarter of  and quarterly revenue dollars in thousands three months ended actual actual actual amount percent amount percent amount percent march    june    september    december    total for year    results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of certain statement of income data to revenues for the periods indicated 
year ended december  revenues cost of educational services student services and administrative expenses operating income interest income  net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in march  an increase in the total student enrollment at january  compared to january   at january  compared to  at january   and a increase in the number of first time and re entering students beginning class at our institutes  in compared to  in 
the total student enrollment on december  was  an increase of compared to  on december  cost of educational services 
cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in from million in the principal causes of this increase included the costs required to service the increased enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  and increased costs due to opening new institutes one opened in march  one opened in june and three opened in september 
cost of educational services as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to the greater facility and faculty utilization efficiencies associated with the three day per week class schedule of the it  ceet and cdd programs  and because certain fixed costs at our institutes did not increase proportionately with increases in our revenues resulting from a larger number of students 
student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in student services and administrative expenses increased to of revenues in compared to of revenues in  primarily due to a increase in media advertising expenses offset by a reduction in bad debt expense from of revenues for to of revenues for income taxes 
our combined effective federal and state income tax rate in was compared to in year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a increase in tuition rates in each of september and june for the it curricula in june  a increase in the total student enrollment at january  compared to january   at january  compared to  at january   a increase in the number of first time and re entering students beginning classes at our institutes  in compared to  in  an increase in the percentage of our students who are enrolled in it curricula  which were priced higher than our other programs  and changes to our student refund policies in october  which increased the amount of tuition and fee payments that we can retain when a student withdraws from one of our institutes during an academic quarter 
the total student enrollment on december  was  an increase of compared to  on december  cost of educational services 
cost of educational services increased million  or  to million in from million in the principal causes of this increase included the costs required to service the increased enrollment  normal inflationary cost increases for wages  rent and other costs of services  the costs associated with offering the it curricula  and the costs associated with opening new institutes one in march  one in december and one in march 
cost of educational services as a percentage of revenues decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to completing the implementation of the it curricula at most institutes in one additional institute began offering the it curricula in compared to additional institutes in 
student services and administrative expenses 
student services and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in student services and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues in compared to of revenues in media advertising costs increased in  or more than the increase in revenues 
despite the increase in media advertising costs and an increase in bad debt expense  fixed costs at our institutes did not increase proportionately with revenues 
income taxes 
our combined effective federal and state income tax rate in was compared to in liquidity and capital resources in  we indirectly derived approximately of our revenues  determined on a cash accounting basis as defined by the ed s regulations  from title iv programs 
federal regulations dictate the timing of disbursements of funds under title iv programs 
students must apply for a new loan for each academic year  which consists of three academic quarters 
loan funds are generally provided by lenders in three disbursements for each academic year 
the first disbursement is usually received either days after in the case of students commencing a program of study or ten days before the start of the first academic quarter of a student s academic year  and the second and third disbursements are typically received ten days before the start of each subsequent quarter of a student s academic year 
while the timing of loan disbursements to us is subject to a student s directions to the lender and to existing regulatory requirements regarding such disbursements  we have typically received student loan funds upon the lender s disbursement of the student loan funds 
on may   we declared a two for one split of our common stock  effected on june  by payment of a stock dividend to all shareholders of record at the close of business on may  of one share on each one share of our common stock issued and outstanding or held as treasury stock on may  stock split 
our earnings per share amounts and the number of shares in all prior periods have been restated to reflect the stock split 
our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions in accordance with rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  or million in total 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  or million in total 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share  or million in total 
all of the repurchased shares of our common stock became treasury shares upon repurchase and most of the repurchased shares continue to be held as treasury shares 
as of december   our existing repurchase authorizations permit us to repurchase an additional  shares of our common stock 
we may elect to repurchase additional shares of our common stock from time to time in the future  depending on market conditions and other considerations 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help us achieve our long term goal of enhancing shareholder value 
our principal uses of cash are to pay salaries  occupancy and equipment costs  recruiting and marketing expenses  administrative expenses and taxes  including institute start up costs for new institutes 
our net cash items consisting of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable debt securities increased from million at december  to million at december  excluding the million used to repurchase  shares of our common stock  the million used to purchase our facilities and the million we received from the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock  cash items increased million in the year ended december  marketable debt securities and cash equivalents ranged from a low of million in may to a high of million in december we have generated positive cash flows from operations for the past five years 
cash flows from operations in was million excluding the million decrease in marketable debt securities  an increase of million from million excluding the million increase in marketable debt securities in this increase was primarily due to higher cash flows from operations caused by the increase in income and accelerated cash collections from students associated with their use of a supplemental student loan program  called the college advantage loan program calp 
the calp has been made available to our students by a private funding source since january the calp offers eligible students and their parents loans to pay the students cost of education that federal and state student financial aid sources do not fully cover 
calp loans are non recourse to us and are disbursed once during each academic year at the start of the first academic quarter of the student s academic year 
at december   we had positive working capital of million 
deferred revenue  which represents the unrecognized portion of revenue received from students  increased million to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the students use of the calp and increased tuition revenue resulting from higher tuition rates and a larger number of students 
during  we recorded a million minimum pension liability adjustment with respect to our obligations under the esi pension plan and a corresponding million reduction in shareholders equity  which is net of a million deferred tax asset 
during  we recorded an additional million minimum pension liability adjustment and a corresponding million reduction in shareholders equity  which is net of a million deferred tax asset 
an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the title iv programs  if the rates at which the institution s students default on federal student loans exceed specific percentages 
an institution whose cohort default rate on loans under the federal family education loan ffel program and the william d 
ford federal direct loan fdl program is or greater for three consecutive federal fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in the ffel  fdl and pell grant programs for the remainder of the federal fiscal year in which the ed determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent federal fiscal years 
none of our campus groups had a ffel fdl cohort default rate equal to or greater than for the  or federal fiscal years  the most recent years for which the ed has published ffel fdl official cohort default rates 
none of our campus groups had a ffel fdl preliminary cohort default rate equal to or greater than for the federal fiscal year  which preliminary rates were issued by the ed in february prior to october   the hea limited how much of a student s tuition and fees an institution could retain for a student who withdrew from the institution refund policy 
a student was only obligated for a pro rata portion of the education costs charged by the institution  if the student withdrew during the first of the student s first period of enrollment 
for our institutes  a period of enrollment is generally an academic quarter 
a student who withdrew after the first period of enrollment was also subject to a refund calculation  but it was not a straight pro rata calculation 
the institution had to refund any monies it collected in excess of the pro rata or other applicable portion to the appropriate lenders or title iv programs in a particular order 
the standards of most of the state education authorities that regulate our institutes the seas and the accrediting council for independent colleges and schools acics that accredits our institutes continue to impose a refund policy 
the hea and its implementing regulations now impose a limit on the amount of title iv program funds withdrawing students can use to pay their education costs return policy 
the return policy permits a student to use only a pro rata portion of the title iv program funds that the student would otherwise be eligible to use  if the student withdraws during the first of any period of enrollment 
the institution must return to the appropriate lenders or the ed any title iv program funds that the institution receives on behalf of a withdrawing student in excess of the amount the student can use for such period of enrollment 
the hea s substitution of the return policy for its refund policy has  in many states  depending on when a student withdraws during an academic quarter  increased the portion of the student s education costs owed to the itt technical institute upon withdrawal and or reduced the amount of title iv program funds that the withdrawing student can use to pay his or her education costs 
in these instances  withdrawing students may be unable to pay all of their education costs and we may be unable to collect a significant portion of these costs 
title iv program funds are generally paid sooner and are more collectible than payments from other sources 
however  the incremental decrease in the amount of title iv program funds that certain withdrawing students used to pay their education costs to our institutes was largely offset by the incremental increase in the education costs owed to us by withdrawing students in certain states 
therefore  the return policy has not had  and we do not expect that it will have  a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
under a provision of the hea commonly referred to as the rule  a for profit institution  such as each of our campus groups  becomes ineligible to participate in title iv programs if  on a cash accounting basis  the institution derives more than of its applicable revenues for a fiscal year from title iv programs 
for our fiscal year  the range of our campus groups was from approximately to approximately during  we purchased the facilities of six of our institutes for a total of million 
we previously leased these facilities under operating lease agreements 
as of december   we had committed to purchase the facility of one additional institute in for million 
we may purchase additional facilities of our institutes in as of december   we leased all of our other facilities under operating lease agreements 
a majority of the operating leases contain renewal options that can be exercised after the initial lease term 
renewal options are generally for periods of one to five years 
all operating leases will expire over the next years and management expects that those leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases in the normal course of business  or that we will purchase the facilities represented by those leases 
there are no material restrictions imposed by the lease agreements  and we have not entered into any significant guarantees related to the leases 
we are required to make additional payments under the operating lease terms for taxes  insurance and other operating expenses incurred during the operating lease period 
future minimum rental payments in thousands required under operating leases that had initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  are as follows later years  our capital assets  other than our facilities discussed above  consist primarily of classroom and laboratory equipment such as computers  electronic equipment and robotic systems  classroom and office furniture  software and leasehold improvements 
capital expenditures  excluding facility purchases  totaled million during and primarily included expenditures of million to replace or add furniture  equipment or computers at existing institutes  million on leasehold improvements  million for new itt technical institutes  million for additional software for our institutes and million for developed or purchased software and computer equipment to enhance our current information systems 
leasehold improvements represent part of our continuing effort to maintain our existing facilities in good condition 
capital expenditures decreased by million to million in from million in  principally due to the million spent in to replace computer equipment used in the computer aided drafting technology program with computer equipment that can also be used in cdd and it programs 
to date  cash generated from operations has been sufficient to meet our capital expenditures 
we plan to continue to upgrade and expand current facilities and equipment 
we expect that capital expenditures will be approximately to million 
the capital additions for a new institute are approximately million and the capital expenditures for each new curriculum at an existing institute are approximately million 
we anticipate that our planned capital additions can be funded from cash flows from operations 
cash flows on a long term basis are highly dependent upon the receipt of title iv program funds and the amount of funds spent on new institutes  curricula additions at existing institutes and possible acquisitions 
we do not believe that any reduction in cash and cash equivalents or marketable debt securities that may result from its use to effect any future stock repurchases or facility purchases will have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans  planned capital expenditures  ability to meet any applicable regulatory financial responsibility standards  or ability to conduct normal operations 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements or any other significant long term obligations  lines of credit  standby letters of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other commercial commitments 
there are no commitments or guarantees that provide for the potential issuance of shares of our common stock
