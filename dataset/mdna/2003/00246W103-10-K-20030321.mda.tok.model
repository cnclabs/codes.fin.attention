overview we were founded in to commercialize and enhance our proprietary vgf technique for producing high performance compound semiconductor substrates 
we currently operate two divisions our substrate division and our opto electronics division 
we made our first substrate sales in and our substrate division currently sells gaas and inp substrates to manufacturers of semiconductor devices for use in applications such as fiber optic and wireless telecommunications  leds and lasers 
we also sell germanium substrates for use in satellite solar cells 
we acquired lyte optronics  inc  on may   and currently operate part of lyte s historical business as our opto electronics division 
the opto electronics division manufactures hbleds  vcsels and laser diodes for the illumination markets  including full color displays  automobile lighting and traffic signals  as well as fiber optic communications 
we previously operated the consumer products division  discontinued in december  which had focused on the design and manufacture of laser pointing and alignment products for the consumer  commercial and industrial markets 

table of contents our total revenue from continuing operations was million for  million for and million for in we incurred a loss from continuing operations of million compared to a loss of million for and income of million for several non recurring events occurred that had a substantial impact on our performance and financial results for the years ended december   and in  we recorded excess inventory impairment charges of million that are included in cost of revenue  equipment impairment charges of million and goodwill impairment charges of million that are included in operating expenses  a write down in our investment in finisar corporation of million and a loss on a building held for sale of million that are included in other expense 
in  we realized a net million non cash loss as a result of writing down our investment in finisar corporation common stock 
this loss is included in other expense 
in  we realized a million non cash gain as a result of acquiring finisar corporation common stock in connection with finisar corporation s acquisition of demeter technologies  a company in which we held warrants to purchase preferred stock 
this gain is included in other income 
on december   the board of directors approved our plan to discontinue our unprofitable consumer products division 
as a result of discontinuing the consumer products division  we incurred a pre tax loss on disposal of million 
the results of operations of the consumer products division have been segregated from continuing operations and are reported separately as discontinued operations in the income statements 
in we exited our unprofitable nm laser diode product line at the opto electronics division 
as a result of exiting this product line  we incurred a restructuring charge of million  of which million has been classified as cost of goods sold and million has been classified as operating expense 
our business  particularly sales of our substrate products  are dependant on the semiconductor industry  which is highly cyclical and has historically experienced downturns both as a result of economic changes and of overcapacity 
following a strong period during the first half of  we are now in the midst of a significant and prolonged downturn  and  together with other industry participants  have experienced lower revenues  slower bookings  push outs and cancellation of orders 
we cannot predict the severity or duration of the downturn  but it has impacted our ability to sell our products and operate profitably 
if demand for our products remains depressed for an extended period  our business will be harmed as a result 
in the second half of  we experienced a million  or decrease in revenue compared to the first half as a result of the rapid decline in the mobile and fiber optic telecommunications markets 
as such  we recorded losses in the third and fourth quarters 
in  the downward revenue trend that began in the second half of continued and full year revenue declined million  or compared to we recorded losses in each quarter of in reaction to the economic downturn  we have initiated an aggressive effort to reduce substrate manufacturing costs 
this includes moving much of our substrate manufacturing operations to china  reducing capacity in our fremont  ca facility and developing and investing in key low cost raw material sources 
we are hopeful that the cost reduction efforts should allow us to operate profitably again by the end of and will position us well for future growth 
during the second half of  we experienced certain manufacturing and quality problems that had a negative impact in obtaining orders from several large customers for hbleds at the opto electronics division  as well as on our substrates  which resulted in decreased orders at our substrate division 
as a result  the divisions continued to experience losses in each quarter of we have initiated measures to improve our manufacturing and quality issues and have taken measures to reduce operating costs 
as a result  we are hopeful that the opto electronics division will also be profitable by the end of during and  we raised approximately  and million  respectively  from the exercise of options by employees to purchase our common stock under our employee stock option plan 
during  we raised approximately million from the sale of common stock in a private offering  a registered public offering and the exercise of options by employees to purchase our common stock under our employee stock option plan 
our five largest customers accounted for of our total revenue from continuing operations in  in and in one customer accounted for of our revenue in and no customer accounted for more than of our total revenue in or 
table of contents each of our divisions is responsible for its own sales and marketing activities  and each maintains its own sales and marketing personnel 
we sell our substrate products through our direct sales force in the us and through independent sales representatives in france  japan  south korea  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we sell our hbled and laser diode products through our direct sales force and through independent sales representatives 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we have had to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported on our financial statements 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments about future events and their effects on our results cannot be determined with certainty  and are made based upon our historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur or additional information is obtained  and we may periodically be faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within our control and may not be known for a prolonged period of time 
the discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition are based upon these statements 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
they may require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates that we could have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting policies revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to our customers provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is probable  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining obligations 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors including past history with the customer and credit worthiness 
we provide for future returns based on historical experience  current economic trends and changes in customer demand at the time revenue is recognized 
except for sales in japan and some sales in taiwan  which in both cases are denominated in japanese yen  we denominate and collect our international sales in us dollars 
we do not provide for warranty related exposure as such exposure has historically been immaterial 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically review the likelihood of collecting our accounts receivable balances and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable primarily based upon the age of these accounts 
we provide a allowance for us receivables in excess of days and for foreign receivables in excess of days 
at december  our accounts receivable balance was million net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the weighted average cost method 
finished goods and work in process inventories include material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we routinely evaluate the levels of our inventory in light of current market conditions in order to identify excess and obsolete inventory and we provide a valuation allowance for certain inventories based upon the age and quality of the product 
the lives of our substrate products are relatively long and accordingly  obsolescence has historically not been a significant factor 
we also review our inventory to ensure costs can be realized upon ultimate sale to our customers 
if we determine that the value of any items in 
table of contents ending inventory exceeds the sales value less any related selling costs  a reserve is established for the difference 
as a result of fourth quarter and expected market conditions  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million to reserve for excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets and investments in order to identify any impairment 
long lived assets are written down to their current fair market value when the carrying value of an asset exceeds their related undiscounted future cash flows 
to determine the fair market value of our long lived assets  we obtain appraisals from outside consultants 
during  we recorded long lived asset and goodwill impairment charges of million 
investments the company classifies its investments in marketable securities as available for sale securities as prescribed in financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all investments are carried at fair market value  which is determined based on quoted market prices  with net unrealized gains and losses included in comprehensive income  net of tax 
if a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis with the amount of the write down included in other income expense 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in and million in to write down our investment in finisar corporation common stock 
income taxes the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the liability method  under which the expected future tax consequences of timing differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets when management estimates  based on available objective evidence  that it is more likely than not that the future income tax benefit represented by the net deferred tax asset will not be realized

gross margin 
gross margin decreased to negative of revenue in compared to in gross margin at the substrate division decreased to negative of revenue in compared to in the decrease was primarily due to lower unit sales and average sales prices of gaas and inp substrates spread over a relatively fixed manufacturing overhead base and a million charge to write down excess inventory 
as a result  we have initiated manufacturing cost reductions in order to align our costs with lower expected sales volumes and prices 
we are currently shifting most of our substrate manufacturing to china and reducing capacity in our fremont  california facility 
gross margin at the opto electronics division increased to negative of revenue for compared to negative for the increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of blue hbled products 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in in order to align our cost structure with the rapid decline in revenues  we have initiated and are aggressively pursuing cost reductions in this area  which led to the decrease in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were in compared to in although we reduced research and development expenses in as part of our effort to reduce costs  we believe that continued investment in product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives of maintaining and increasing our technology leadership  and as a result  we expect research and development expenses to remain at current levels in future periods 
research and development efforts during were focused primarily on improving the yield and surface quality of our gaas substrates  and improving the brightness  reliability  and yield of our hbled products 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or  to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the repayment of certain long term real estate notes and capital equipment leases 
other income and expense 
other expense was million in compared to million in the amount in includes non cash charges of million related to the write down to market value of our investment in finisar corporation common stock and million to write down a building held for sale to net realizable value 
the balance includes a non cash charge of million to write down to market value our investment in finisar common stock 
provision for income taxes 
due to our continuing operating losses during and uncertainty regarding future profitability  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets of million in as a result  our effective tax rate decreased to in and will be in the foreseeable future 
our effective tax rate in was

selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in compared to in the increase was due to the addition of personnel and facilities in anticipation of increased revenues after the expansion of orders experienced in due to the decline in substrate revenue in the second half of  we initiated cost reductions in this area 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased  or  to million in compared to million in as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses were in compared to in interest expense

our effective tax rate decreased to in compared to in the decrease was primarily the result of shifting certain substrate manufacturing operations to china 
liquidity and capital resources we consider cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments as liquid and available for use 
short and long term investments are comprised of government bonds and high grade commercial debt instruments 
also included in short term investments is our common stock investment in finisar corporation 
cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  excluding million and million for our investment in finisar common stock at december  and respectively  decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  
table of contents the decrease in available cash included restricting million as additional collateral with our bank as a result of a modification to our credit facility  restricting million as collateral for a million letter of credit supporting our workers compensation insurance policy  purchases of capital equipment of million and debt repayments of million offset by borrowings of million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  was comprised primarily of our net loss adjusted for non cash items of million  consisting primarily of the equipment and goodwill impairment charges of million  the write down to market value of our investment in finisar corporation common stock of million  and depreciation of million and by a million net change in assets and liabilities 
the net change in assets and liabilities resulted primarily from a decrease in inventory and accounts receivable  an increase in accounts payable  offset by increases in income tax receivables and a decrease in accrued liabilities 
accounts receivable decreased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  the change reflects lower sales volume  collections of million and no change in our allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
inventories decreased million  or to million at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in inventory included an increase in the valuation reserve of million and a real decrease in on hand components of million 
as a result of the continued decline in unit sales during and uncertainty regarding the future  we have initiated plans to aggressively reduce inventory levels during net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  includes purchases of property and equipment of million primarily used to transfer production capacity to china for the substrate division and to increase hbled epitaxy growth and wafer processing capacity at the opto electronics division 
it also includes  in purchases of high grade investment securities with maturities of less than two years and a transfer of million to restricted deposits to collateralize a letter of credit with a bank that supports our workers compensation insurance policy 
we do not have any plans to initiate any major new capital spending projects through we are currently completing certain projects at our china facilities and are continuously constructing minor improvements to our existing production facilities in china and california 
we expect to invest approximately million in capital projects in we believe that our existing and planned facilities and equipment are sufficient to fulfill current and expected future orders 
net cash used in financing activities of million consisted of proceeds of  from the exercise of options by our employees  additional long term borrowings of million  offset by payments of million to reduce long term borrowings and million for capital lease payments 
we generally finance equipment purchases through secured equipment loans and capital leases over four or five year terms at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
our main fremont  california manufacturing facility is financed by long term borrowings  which were refinanced by taxable variable rate revenue bonds in these bonds mature in and bear interest at a variable rate that was at december  the bonds are traded in the public market 
repayment of principal and interest under the bonds is supported by a letter of credit from our bank and is paid on a quarterly basis 
we have the option to redeem the bonds in whole or in part during their term 
at december   million was outstanding under these bonds 
at june   the credit facility maintained by the company with a bank included a million line of credit with no balance outstanding  term loans in the amount of million and a letter of credit supporting repayment of the company s industrial revenue bonds with an outstanding amount of million 
the credit facility is collateralized by all corporate personal and real property owned by the company 
as of june   the company was in default of the credit facility by failure to maintain certain financial covenants required under the terms of the facility 
as a result  on september  we modified the credit agreement with our bank  which waived the covenant default  terminated the credit line  amended the financial covenants 
table of contents and added additional collateral to secure repayment of the bonds 
at december  the credit facility included a letter of credit supporting our bonds with an outstanding amount of million and foreign exchange and overdraft obligations in the amount of million 
the company has pledged and placed certain investment securities with the trust department of the bank as additional collateral for this facility 
as a result  million of our long term investments are restricted 
as of december   we are out of compliance with our tangible net worth covenant as amended on september  we have obtained a waver from our bank for this covenant default through april  effective april   our bonds will be supported by a new letter of credit supported by another bank 
as a result of the significant revenue declines that we have experienced over the past six quarters  we have taken cost reduction measures and continue to pursue additional measures to reduce our costs and increase our cash flows 
at december   we had available cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations  coupled with additional efforts to reduce our expenditures in support of our substrate and opto electronic businesses  will be sufficient to meet our working capital expenditure requirements for the next months 
however  our existing cash and cash equivalents could continue to decline during due to a continued or further weakening of the economy or changes in our planned cash outlay 
if our sales continue to decrease  our ability to generate cash from operations will be adversely affected which could adversely affect our future liquidity  require us to use more cash at a more rapid rate than expected  and require us to seek additional capital 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital will be available or  if available it will be at terms acceptable to the company 
cash from operations could be affected by various risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to those set forth below under risks related to our business

risks related to our business the semiconductor industry is cyclical and is currently experiencing a severe and prolonged downturn which has adversely impacted our operating results 
our business depends in significant part upon manufacturers of electronic and opto electronic semiconductor devices  as well as the current and anticipated market demand for such devices and products using such devices 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical 
the industry has in the past  and will likely in the future  experience periods of oversupply that result in significantly reduced demand for semiconductor devices and components  including our products  both as a result of general economic changes and overcapacity 
when these periods occur  our operating results and financial condition are adversely affected  and create pressure on our revenue  gross margins and net income 
inventory buildups in telecommunications products and slower than expected sales of computer equipment resulted in overcapacity and led to reduced sales by our customers  and therefore reduced purchases of our products 
during periods of declining demand such as those experienced over the past year  customers typically reduce purchases  delay delivery of products and or cancel orders of component parts such as our products 
increased price competition may result  causing pressure on our net sales  gross margin and net income 
we have over the past year experienced cancellations  delays and push outs of orders  which have resulted in reduced revenues 
if the economic downturn continues  further order cancellations  reductions in order size or delays in orders will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although we have taken actions to reduce our costs  if our actions are insufficient to align our structure with prevailing business conditions  we may be required to undertake additional cost cutting measures  and may be unable to invest in marketing  research and development and engineering at the levels we believe are necessary to maintain our competitive position 
our failure to make these investments could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we may continue to experience a decline in our cash and cash equivalents and therefore we may be required to seek additional sources of cash  which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 

table of contents the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers may cause us to fail to meet expectations  which would negatively impact the price of our stock 
our operating results can vary significantly based upon the impact of changes in global economic conditions on our customers 
more specifically  the macro economic environment that we faced in the second half of and continued to face in is more uncertain than in prior periods  has lasted longer than expected and has materially and adversely affected us and our operating results and may continue to do so 
the revenue growth and profitability of our business depends on the overall demand for our substrates  led s and laser diodes  and we are particularly dependant on the market conditions for the wireless  fiber optics and telecommunications industries 
because our sales are primarily to major corporate customers whose businesses fluctuate with general economic and business conditions  a softening of demand for products that use our substrates  leds and laser diodes caused by a weakening economy may result in further or prolonged decreased revenues 
customers may find themselves facing excess inventory from earlier purchases  and may defer or reconsider purchasing products due to the downturn in their business and in the general economy 
unpredictable fluctuations in our operating results could disappoint analysts or our investors  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we have not over the past year been able to sustain growth  and may not be able to return to historic growth levels in the current economic environment 
our net loss in is the largest in our history 
we have and may continue to experience significant fluctuations in our revenue and earnings 
our quarterly and annual revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including decline in general economic conditions or downturns in the industry in which we compete  fluctuations in demand for our products  expansion of our manufacturing capacity  expansion of our operations in china  limited availability and increased cost of raw materials  the volume and timing of orders from our customers  and cancellations  push outs and delays of customer orders  fluctuation of our manufacturing yields  decreases in the prices of our competitors products  costs incurred in connection with any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies  increases in our expenses  including expenses for research and development  and our ability to develop  manufacture and deliver high quality products in a timely and cost effective manner 
due to these factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a meaningful indicator of our future performance 
our operating results have over the past year at times been below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs again in future periods  the price of our common stock would likely decline or fluctuate 
a substantial percentage of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we may be unable to adjust spending to compensate for an unexpected shortfall in revenues 
as a result  any delay in generating revenue could cause our operating results to be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could also cause our stock price to fall 
the lead time for customer orders is generally shorter than it was eighteen year ago 
as a result  our visibility regarding future financial performance is uncertain and we have and may continue to provide investors with financial guidance that we cannot meet 
as a result  our operating results could be below the expectations of market analysts or investors  which could also cause our stock price to fall 

table of contents if the economy recovers and we are again in a period of high demand for our products  we may be unable to expand our manufacturing capacity quickly enough to meet increased demand  and we may be unable to lower our costs or increase revenue 
although we are currently in a period of overcapacity  reduced sales  and decreased margins  if the economy recovers  demand may increase rapidly as it has in prior years after other cyclical downturns in the economy and the industries in which we operate 
if this happens  in order to meet increased demand and maintain our market share  we may need to increase production  which could require us to build new facilities  expand and modify our existing facilities  purchase additional manufacturing equipment  and add qualified staff 
if we are not at that time able to expand our manufacturing capacity  we will be unable to increase production  which may adversely impact our ability to meet increased production demand while reducing unit costs  margins and improving our operating results 
we are currently constructing and modifying facilities in california and china 
our construction activities subject us to a number of risks  including unforeseen environmental or engineering problems  unavailability or late delivery of production equipment  delays in completing new facilities  delays in bringing production equipment on line  work stoppages or delays  inability to recruit and train qualified staff  unanticipated cost increases and restrictions imposed by requirements of local  state or federal regulatory agencies in the united states and china 
if any of these risks occurs  construction may be costlier than anticipated and completion could be delayed  which could hurt our ability to expand capacity and increase our sales 
in addition  if we experience delays in expanding our manufacturing capacity  we might not be able to timely meet customer requirements  and we could lose future sales 
we are also completing selective investments in equipment and facilities as part of our previously planned capacity expansion 
to offset the additional fixed operating expenses  we must increase our revenue by increasing production and improving yields 
if demand for our products does not grow or if our yields do not improve as anticipated  we may be unable to offset these costs against increased revenue  which would adversely impact our operating results 
our results of operations may suffer if we do not effectively manage our inventory 
we must manage our inventory of component parts and finished goods effectively to meet changing customer requirements  while keeping inventory costs down and improving gross margins 
some of our products and supplies have in the past and may in the future become obsolete while in inventory due to changing customer specifications  or become excess inventory due to decreased demand for our products and an inability to sell the inventory within a foreseeable period 
furthermore  if current costs of production increase or sales prices drop below the standard prices at which we value inventory  we may need to take a charge for a reduction in inventory values 
we have in the past had to take inventory valuation and impairment charges 
if we are not successfully able to manage our inventory  we may need to write off unsaleable  obsolete or excess inventory  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations  expansion of capacity  or changes in manufacturing processes  which may not be available 
we may need additional capital to fund expansion of our manufacturing and production capacity and our future operations or acquisitions 
if we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of holders of our common stock 
for example  in december we issued debt securities for the purchase and improvement of our facilities in fremont  california 

table of contents if we require additional capital in the future  it might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed  we may be required to reduce the scope of our product line  the planned expansion of our manufacturing capacity or of our product development and marketing efforts  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our hbled and vcsel products are in their early stages  and we may not be able to achieve anticipated sales of these products 
we have experienced declining revenue for both our hbled and laser diode products as a result of a loss of revenue from our leading led customer and a decline in the market for our laser diode products  as well as due to quality control problems experienced on these products 
we may be unable to successfully market and increase sales of these products 
to market and increase sales of our hbled and vcsel products  we will have to continue to develop additional distribution channels and achieve certain product and reliability specifications 
we may be unable to obtain significant increases in revenue and may seek potential investors for our opto electronics business 
we must also continue our research and development efforts to apply our proprietary vgf technique to new substrate products and successfully introduce and market new opto electronic semiconductor devices  including enhancements to our hbled and vcsel products 
if we do not successfully develop new products to respond to rapidly changing customer requirements  our ability to generate sales and obtain new customers may suffer 
our success depends on our ability to offer new products that incorporate leading technology and respond to technological advances 
in addition  our new products must meet customer needs and compete effectively on quality  price and performance 
the life cycles of our products are difficult to predict because the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs and evolving industry standards 
if our competitors introduce products employing new technologies  our existing products could become obsolete and unmarketable 
if we fail to offer new products  we may not generate sufficient revenue to offset our development costs and other expenses or meet our customers requirements 
other companies  including ibm and motorola  are actively developing substrate materials that could be used to manufacture devices that could provide the same high performance  low power capabilities as gaas based devices at competitive prices 
in addition  some of our competitors have developed vgf technology similar to ours 
if these substrate materials or vgf derived products are successfully developed and semiconductor device manufacturers adopt them  demand for our gaas substrates could decline and our revenue could suffer 
similarly  other companies  including kopin  are developing alternative production technologies for hbleds 
if they are successful  demand for our hbleds could drop and our revenue could decline 
the development of new products can be a highly complex process  and we may experience delays in developing and introducing new products 
any significant delays could cause us to fail to timely introduce and gain market acceptance of new products 
further  the costs involved in researching  developing and engineering new products could be greater than anticipated 
our operating results depend in large part on further customer acceptance of our existing substrate products and on our ability to develop new products based on our core vgf technology 
some of our competitors have developed a crystal growth technique similar to our vgf technology 
as a result  some customers are now allocating their requirements for vgf grown substrates across more competitors and we believe that we may have lost revenue and market share as a result of these customer decisions  which we may be unable to recover 
if we are unable to retain our market share  our revenue and performance will decline 
to shift more of our substrate manufacturing operations to china successfully  we will need our customers to qualify products manufactured in china 
if we are unable to achieve qualifications for these products  our china facility will be underutilized  our investments in china will not be recouped and we will be unable to lower our costs by moving to china 
we may lose sales of our products to competitors who are not 
table of contents manufacturing in china  or whose operations in china have already been qualified by customers 
all of these events could reduce our revenue but increase our cost structure 
intense competition in the markets for our products could prevent us from increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive 
we face competition for our substrate products from other manufacturers of substrates  such as freiberger  hitachi cable  japan energy and sumitomo electric and from semiconductor device manufacturers that produce substrates for their own use  and from companies  such as ibm and motorola  that are actively developing alternative materials to gaas and some semiconductor devices are being marketed using these materials 
we believe that at least two of our competitors are shipping gaas substrates manufactured using a technique similar to our vgf technique 
other competitors may develop and begin using similar technology 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our revenue may not increase and we may be unable to be profitable 
we face many competitors that have a number of significant advantages over us  particularly in our compound semiconductor device products  including greater experience in the business  more manufacturing experience  extensive intellectual property  broader name recognition  and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
our competitors could develop new or enhanced products that are more effective than the products that we have developed or may develop 
for example  some competitors in the hbled market offer devices that are brighter than our hbleds and have other desirable features 
some of our competitors may also develop technologies that enable the production of commercial products with characteristics similar to or better than ours  but at a lower cost 
the level and intensity of competition has increased over the past year and we expect competition to continue to increase in the future 
competitive pressures caused by the current economic conditions have resulted in reductions in the prices of some of our products  and continued or increased competition could reduce our market share  require us to further reduce the prices of our products  affect our ability to recover costs or result in reduced gross margins 
if we have low product yields  the shipment of our products may be delayed and our operating results may be adversely impacted 
our products are manufactured using complex technologies  and the number of usable substrates and devices we can produce can fluctuate as a result of many factors  including impurities in the materials used  contamination of the manufacturing environment  substrate breakage  equipment failure  power outages or variations in the manufacturing process  and performance of personnel involved in the manufacturing process 
because many of our manufacturing costs are fixed  our revenue could decline if our yields decrease but our costs would change little  if at all 
we have experienced product shipment delays and difficulties in achieving acceptable yields on both new and older products  and delays and poor yields have adversely affected our operating results  as have quality control problems experienced on both our substrate and led products 
we may experience similar problems in the future and we cannot predict when they may occur or their 
table of contents severity 
in addition  many of our manufacturing processes are new and are still being refined  which can result in lower yields  particularly as we focus on producing higher diameter substrates and new opto electronic semiconductor devices 
for example  we recently made substantial investments in equipment and facilities to manufacture blue  green and cyan hbleds and vcsels 
if we are unable to produce adequate quantities of our high brightness leds and vcsels  we may not be able to meet customer demand and our revenue may decrease while our costs remain largely unchanged 
demand for our products may decrease if our customers experience difficulty manufacturing  marketing or selling their products 
our products are used as components in our customers products 
accordingly  demand for our products is subject to factors affecting the ability of our customers to successfully introduce and market their products  including the competition our customers face in their particular industries  the technical  manufacturing  sales and marketing and management capabilities of our customers  the financial and other resources of our customers  and the inability of our customers to sell their products if they infringe third party intellectual property rights 
if demand for the products offered by our customers decreases  our customers may reduce purchases of our products 
as inventory of telecommunication products and computer equipment remained high during the past year  resulting in overcapacity in the market  our customers have reduced sales of their products  causing them to reduce purchases of our products for both production and research and development purposes 
as a result  our revenues have declined and may fail to recover until the overcapacity has been depleted and demand for our customers products once again increases and their expenditures for research and development increase 
we purchase critical raw materials and parts for our equipment from single or limited sources  and could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials  components and equipment used in manufacturing our products  including key materials such as gallium  arsenic  quartz  and parts for our mocvd reactors 
we generally purchase these materials through standard purchase orders and not pursuant to long term supply contracts and none of our suppliers guarantees supply of raw materials or equipment to us 
if we lose any of our key suppliers  our manufacturing efforts could be significantly hampered and we could be prevented from timely producing and delivering products to our customers 
we have experienced delays obtaining critical raw materials and spare parts  including gallium  due to shortages of these materials 
we may experience delays due to shortages of materials and may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of materials 
these shortages and delays could result in higher materials costs and cause us to delay or reduce production of our products 
if we have to delay or reduce production  we could fail to meet customer delivery schedules  and our revenue and operating results could suffer 
we have periodically encountered a decline in quality of parts that are critical to the performance of our mocvd reactors  which has led to lower yields of our hbled products 
if these quality problems continue  our ability to manufacture our hbled products would be reduced  we could fail to meet customer delivery schedules  and our revenue and operating results could suffer 
if we fail to comply with environmental and safety regulations  we may be subject to significant fines or cessation of our operations 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations in all of our operating locations 
these laws  rules and regulations govern the use  storage  discharge and disposal of 
table of contents hazardous chemicals during manufacturing  research and development and sales demonstrations 
if we fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could be subject to substantial liability for clean up efforts  personal injury and fines or suspension or cessation of our operations 
in march  we settled a claim made by the california occupational safety and health administration  or cal osha  in an investigation primarily regarding impermissible levels of potentially hazardous materials in certain areas of our manufacturing facility in fremont  california for  although we have put in place engineering  administrative and personnel protective equipment programs to address these issues  our ability to expand or continue to operate our present locations could be restricted or we could be required to acquire costly remediation equipment or incur other significant expenses 
in addition  existing or future changes in laws or regulations may require us to incur significant expenditures or liabilities  or may restrict our operations 
the loss of one or more of our key substrate customers would significantly hurt our operating results 
a small number of substrate and hbled customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our total revenue 
five customers accounted for of our total revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  one customer accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  our substrate revenue accounted for of our total revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we expect that a significant portion of our future revenue will continue to be derived from a limited number of substrate and hbled customers 
our customers are not obligated to purchase a specified quantity of our products or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases 
in addition  our customers may reduce  delay or cancel orders at any time without any significant penalty  and during the past year  we have experienced slower bookings  significant push outs and cancellation of orders 
in addition  due to the difficult economic environment  several of our previously large customers have stopped operations entirely 
if we lose a major customer or if a customer cancels  reduces or delays orders  our revenue would decline 
in addition  customers that have accounted for significant revenue in the past may not continue to generate revenue for us in any future period 
any delay in scheduled shipments of our products could cause net sales to fall below our expectations and the expectations of market analysts or investors  causing our stock price to decline 
defects in our products could diminish demand for our products 
our products are complex and may contain defects 
in the past we have experienced quality control problems with some of our products  which caused customers to return products to us or reduce orders for our products  such as our recent reduction in orders for our led products by agilent  and certain quality control problems experience in our substrate products 
if we continue to experience quality control problems  or experience these problems in new products  customers may cancel or reduce orders or purchase products from our competitors 
defects in our products could cause us to incur higher manufacturing costs and suffer product returns and additional service expenses  all of which could adversely impact our operating results 
we are also developing new products and product enhancements  including substrates and compound semiconductor device products 
if our new products contain defects when released  our customers may be dissatisfied and we may suffer negative publicity or customer claims against us  lose sales or experience delays in market acceptance of our new products 
our substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products have a long qualification cycle that makes it difficult to plan our expenses and forecast our results 
customers typically place orders with us for our substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products three months to a year or more after our initial contact with them 
the sale of our products may be subject to delays due to our customers lengthy internal budgeting  approval and evaluation processes 
during this time  we may incur substantial expenses and expend sales  marketing and management efforts while the customers evaluate our products 
these expenditures may not result in sales of our products 
if we do not achieve anticipated sales in a period as expected  we may experience an unplanned shortfall in our revenue 
as a result  we may not be able to cover expenses  causing our operating results to vary 
in addition  if a customer decides not to incorporate our products into its initial design  we may not have another opportunity to sell 
table of contents products to this customer for many months or even years 
in this difficult economic climate  the average sales cycle for our products has lengthened even further and is expected to continue to make it difficult to accurately forecast our future sales 
we anticipate that sales of any future substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products under development will also have lengthy sales cycles and will  therefore  be subject to risks substantially similar to those inherent in the lengthy sales cycle of our current substrate and opto electronic semiconductor device products 
as our business matures  we may need to upgrade our systems 
in the past  periods of rapid growth and expansion has strained our management and other resources 
the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and the shift of manufacturing operations to china has placed and continues to place a significant strain on our operations and management resources  and we are in the process of upgrading our inventory control systems and may implement additional systems relating to consolidation of our financial results 
if we fail to manage these changes effectively  our operations may be disrupted 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act requires us to improve the quality of our systems and procedures 
to manage our business effectively  we may need to implement additional and improved management information systems  further develop our operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls  add experienced senior level managers  and maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  accounting  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
if necessary  we will spend substantial sums to support our future growth and shift to china and to comply with the reporting and attestation requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
we may incur additional unexpected costs 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations  and we may be unable to expand quickly enough to exploit potential market opportunities 
if we fail to manage periodic contractions  we may utilize our cash balances and our existing cash and cash equivalent balances could decline 
we have experienced a period of rapid contraction in our business that caused us to reduce our costs in order to conserve our cash resources 
however  in the three months ended september   we utilized million in our operating activities and for the year ended december   our cash and cash equivalent balances  exclusive of restricted cash  declined by million to million 
if we fail to manage our contractions successfully we may continue to draw down our cash reserves  which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition  reduce our value and may impinge our ability to raise debt and equity funding in the future  at a time when we may be required to raise additional cash 
as part of our effort to reduce costs  we may lose key staff  production resources  and technology that we will need to grow when end markets recover 
these events could reduce our ability to grow profitably as markets recover 
as a result of the difficult economic conditions  we have implemented restructuring and workforce reductions  which may adversely affect the morale and performance of our personnel and our ability to hire new personnel 
in connection with our efforts to streamline operations  reduce costs and bring staffing and structure in line with current demand for our products  we implemented a corporate restructuring beginning in and reduced our workforce  shifted production activities to china and reduced capital expenditures 
our restructuring may yield unanticipated consequences  such as attrition beyond our planned reduction in workforce and loss of employee morale and decreased performance 
in addition  the recent trading levels of our stock have decreased the value of our stock options granted to employees under our stock option plan 
as a result of these factors  our remaining personnel may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies that they perceive as having less volatile stock prices 
continuity of personnel can be very important factors in the sales and production of our products and completion of our research and development efforts 

table of contents any future acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or distract management attention 
as part of our strategy  we may consider acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer products  services and technologies complementary to ours  such as our acquisition of lyte optronics in may acquisitions entail numerous risks  including we may have difficulty assimilating the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses  our ongoing business may be disrupted  we may incur unanticipated costs  our management may be unable to manage the financial and strategic position of acquired or developed products  services and technologies  we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls and procedures and policies  and our relationships with employees and customers may be impaired as a result of any integration 
for example  we incurred substantial costs in connection with our acquisition of lyte optronics  including the assumption of approximately million of debt  much of which has been repaid or renegotiated  resulting in a decline of cash available 
we have also incurred consistent operating losses for the business since the acquisition 
to the extent that we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase stock in connection with any future acquisitions  dilution to our existing stockholders will result and our earnings per share may suffer 
any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
if any of our facilities is damaged by actions such as fire  explosion  or natural disaster  we may not be able to manufacture our products 
the ongoing operation of our manufacturing and production facilities in california and china is critical to our ability to meet demand for our products 
if we are not able to use all or a significant portion of our facilities for prolonged periods for any reason  we will not be able to manufacture products for our customers 
for example  a natural disaster  fire or explosion caused by our use of combustible chemicals and high temperatures during our manufacturing processes would render some or all of our facilities inoperable for an indefinite period of time 
actions outside of our control  such as earthquakes  could also damage our facilities  rendering them inoperable 
some of our crystal growth is currently performed at our fremont  california facilities  which are located near an active seismic fault line 
if we are unable to operate our facilities and manufacture our products  we will lose customers and revenue and our business will be harmed 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our success depends upon the continued service of morris s 
young  phd  our president  chairman of the board and chief executive officer  as well as other key management and technical personnel 
we do not have long term employment contracts with  or key person life insurance on  any of our key personnel 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
the competition for these employees is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting and retaining new personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  including the timely introduction of new products 

table of contents if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may lose valuable assets or incur costly litigation 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary technology 
however  we believe that  due to the rapid pace of technological innovation in the markets for our products  our ability to establish and maintain a position of technology leadership also depends on the skills of our development personnel 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property  a third party could develop products or processes similar to ours 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around our patents 
we believe that at least two of our competitors have begun to ship gaas substrates produced using a process similar to our vgf technique 
our competitors may also develop and patent improvements to the vgf  led and vcsel technologies upon which we rely  and thus may limit any exclusivity we enjoy by virtue of our patents or trade secrets 
it is possible that pending or future united states or foreign patent applications made by us will not be approved  that our issued patents will not protect our intellectual property  or that third parties will challenge the ownership rights or the validity of our patents 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states and it may be more difficult to monitor the use of our intellectual property 
our competitors may be able to legitimately ascertain non patented proprietary technology embedded in our systems 
if this occurs  we may not be able to prevent the development of technology substantially similar to ours 
we may have to resort to costly litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to determine their scope  validity or enforceability 
enforcing or defending our proprietary technology is expensive  could cause us to divert resources and may not prove successful 
our protective measures may prove inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  and if we fail to enforce or protect our rights  we could lose valuable assets 
we might face intellectual property infringement claims that may be costly to resolve and could divert management attention 
other companies may hold or obtain patents on inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology necessary to our business 
the markets in which we compete are comprised of competitors who in some cases hold substantial patent portfolios covering aspects of products that could be similar to ours 
we could become subject to claims that we are infringing patent  trademark  copyright or other proprietary rights of others  and are currently in discussions with one company concerning alleged patent infringement 
litigation to determine the validity of alleged claims could be time consuming and result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not the litigation is ultimately determined in our favor 
if a lawsuit is decided against us  we could be subject to significant liabilities  requiring us to seek costly licenses or preventing us from manufacturing and selling our products 
we may not be able to obtain required licensing agreements on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from international sales  and our ability to sustain and increase our international sales involves significant risks 
our revenue growth depends in part on the expansion of our international sales and operations 
international sales represented of our total revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  we expect that sales to customers outside the us will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenue  particularly sales to customers in asia 

table of contents our dependence on international sales involves a number of risks  including changes in tariffs  import or export restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer periods to collect accounts receivable  changes in export license requirements  political and economic instability  unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  and foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
our sales are denominated in us dollars  except for sales to our japanese and some taiwanese customers  which are denominated in japanese yen 
thus  increases in the value of the us dollar could increase the price of our products in non us markets and make our products more expensive than competitors products in these markets 
also  denominating some sales in japanese yen subjects us to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the japanese yen 
the functional currencies of our japanese and chinese subsidiaries are the local currencies 
we incur transaction gains or losses resulting from consolidation of expenses incurred in local currencies for these subsidiaries  as well as in translation of the assets and liabilities of these assets at each balance sheet date 
if we do not effectively manage the risks associated with international sales  our revenue  cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected 
if our expansion in china is more costly than we expect  our operating results will suffer 
as part of our planned reduction of our cost structure  we are building new facilities and expanding existing facilities in china 
if we are unable to build and expand our chinese facilities in a timely manner  we may not be able to reduce the costs of our products as planned 
if our expansion in china proves more costly than we anticipate or we incur greater ongoing costs than we expect  our operating results would be adversely affected 
if we do not realize expected cost savings once our expansion is complete in china  our margins may be negatively impacted and our operating results may suffer 
changes in china s political  social and economic environment may affect our financial performance 
our financial performance may be affected by changes in china s political  social and economic environment 
the role of the chinese central and local governments in the chinese economy is significant 
chinese policies toward economic liberalization  and laws and policies affecting technology companies  foreign investment  currency exchange rates and other matters could change  resulting in greater restrictions on our ability to do business and operate our manufacturing facilities in china 
any imposition of surcharges or any increase in chinese tax rates could hurt our operating results 
the chinese government could revoke  terminate or suspend our license for national security and similar reasons without compensation to us 
if the government of china were to take any of these actions  we would be prevented from conducting all or part of our business 
any failure on our part to comply with governmental regulations could result in the loss of our ability to manufacture our products in china 
china has from time to time experienced instances of civil unrest and hostilities 
confrontations have occurred between the military and civilians 
events of this nature could influence the chinese economy  result in nationalization of foreign owned operations such as ours  and could negatively affect our ability to operate our facilities in china 
the effect of terrorist threats and actions on the general economy could decrease our revenues 
on september   the united states was subject to terrorist attacks at the world trade center buildings in new york and the pentagon in washington dc  and continues to be on alert for further terrorist activity 
in addition  the united states continues to consider hostile activity with iraq 
the potential near and long term impact of these attacks and other terrorist activities  as well as the threat of war may have in regards 
table of contents to our suppliers  customers and markets for our products and the us economy  are uncertain 
there may be other potential adverse effects on our operating results due to this significant event that we cannot foresee 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated significantly since we began trading on the nasdaq national market 
for the year ended december   the high and low closing sales prices of our common stock were and  respectively 
a number of factors could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results  changes in expectations about our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates of securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  new product introduction by us or our competitors  large customer orders or order cancellations  and the operating and stock price performance of comparable companies 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
if we fail to comply with nasdaq rules  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could eliminate the trading market for our common stock 
if we fail to meet the criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
for example  the sales price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market dropped below  if the price should be sustained at a level below one for a period of days  and we are thereafter unable to sustain the sales price above for ten consecutive trading days in the subsequent days  our stock could be delisted 
if the stock is delisted  we may trade on the over the counter market  or even in the pink sheets  which would significantly decrease the liquidity of an investment in axt common stock 
in addition  the stock may be deemed to be penny stock 
if our common stock is considered penny stock  it would be subject to rules that impose additional sales practices on broker dealers who sell our securities 
for example  broker dealers would have to make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transaction prior to sale 
also  a disclosure schedule must be prepared prior to any transaction involving a penny stock and disclosure is required about sales commissions payable to both the broker dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities 
monthly statements are also required to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stock 
because of these additional obligations  some brokers may be unwilling to effect transactions in penny stocks 
this could have an adverse effect on the liquidity of our common stock and the ability of investors to sell the common stock 
provisions in our charter  bylaws or delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger  acquisition or change of control of us  or changes in our management 
these provisions include the division of our board of directors into three separate classes  each with three year terms  the right of our board to elect a director to fill a space created by a board vacancy or the expansion of the board  
table of contents the ability of our board to alter our bylaws  the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of up to  shares of blank check preferred stock  and the requirement that only our board or the holders of at least of our outstanding shares may call a special meeting of our stockholders 
furthermore  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
these provisions prohibit large stockholders  in particular those owning or more of the outstanding voting stock  from consummating a merger or combination with a corporation unless of the shares of voting stock not owned by these large stockholders approve the merger or combination  or the board of directors approves the merger or combination or the transaction which resulted in the large stockholder owning or more of our outstanding voting stock 
we have adopted certain anti takeover measures that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of shares of preferred stock  while potentially providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and for other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock 
further  on april   our board of directors adopted a preferred stock purchase rights plan intended to guard against certain takeover tactics 
the adoption of this plan was not in response to any proposal to acquire us  and the board is not aware of any such effort 
the existence of this plan could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the financial condition of our customers may affect their ability to pay amounts owed to us 
many of our customers are facing business downturns that have reduced their cash balances and their prospects 
we frequently allow our customers to pay for products we ship to them within to days after delivery 
subsequent to our shipping a product some customers have been unable to make payments as due  reducing our cash balances and causing us to incur charges to allow for a possibility that some accounts might not be paid 
at least two customers that owed us a significant amount have filed for bankruptcy protection and we are unlikely to receive a substantial portion or any of the amount owed to us as part of a bankruptcy settlement 
other customers may also be forced to file for bankruptcy 
if our customers do not pay their accounts when due  we will be required to incur charges that would reduce our earnings 
legislative actions  higher insurance costs and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to cause our general and administrative expenses to increase and impact our future financial position and results of operations 
in order to comply with the newly adopted sarbanes oxley act of  as well as proposed changes to listing standards by nasdaq  and proposed accounting changes by the securities and exchange commission  we may be required to increase our internal controls  hire additional personnel and additional outside legal  accounting and advisory services  all of which will cause our general and administrative costs to increase 
insurers are likely to increase premiums as a result of the high claims rates incurred over the past year  and so 
table of contents our premiums for our various insurance policies  including our directors and officers insurance policies  are likely to increase 
proposed changes in the accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense among others  could materially increase the expense that we report under generally accepted accounting principles and adversely affect our operating results 
liquidity the company incurred losses of million during the year ended december  resulting in a million decrease in cash
