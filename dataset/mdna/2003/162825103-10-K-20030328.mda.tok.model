item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  and bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the critical accounting policies have been consistently applied throughout the accompanying financial statements  with the exception of the change in accounting method for goodwill  as noted below 
the company believes the following accounting policy is critical to the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  the company changed its accounting method for recognizing revenue on the sale of equipment where post shipment obligations exist 
previously  the company recognized revenue for equipment when title transferred  generally upon shipment 
beginning with the first quarter of year  the company began recognizing revenue when installation is complete or other post shipment obligations have been satisfied 
equipment leased to customers under sales type leases is accounted for as the equivalent of a sale 
the present value of such lease revenues is recorded as net revenues  and the related cost of the equipment is charged to cost of revenues 
the deferred finance charges applicable to these leases are recognized over the terms of the leases using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
rental revenue from equipment under operating leases is recognized over the term of the lease 
service revenue is recognized  for service contracts  on a straight line basis over the contractual period  and  for non contract work  as services are performed 
sales to third party leasing companies are recognized as the equivalent of a sale 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the adequacy of the reserves for doubtful accounts is continually assessed 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  impairing their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if economic or political conditions were to change in the countries where the company does business  it could have a significant impact on the results of operations  and the company s ability to realize the full value of its accounts receivable 
furthermore  the company is dependent on customers in the retail markets 
economic difficulties experienced in those markets could have a significant impact on the results of operations  and the company s ability to realize the full value of its accounts receivables 
inventory reserves 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets include property  plant  and equipment  goodwill  and identified intangible assets 
with the exception of goodwill  long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the fair value of the long lived assets is based upon the company s estimates of future cash flows and other factors 
following the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on december  fiscal year  which requires  at least on an annual basis  testing for the impairment of goodwill  the fair value of goodwill will be based upon the company s estimates of future cash flows and other factors including discount rates 
if these assets or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
a significant erosion of future business results in any of the business units could create impairment in goodwill or other long lived assets and require a significant write down in future periods 
deferred taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company considers future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
accounting for loss contingencies 
the company is involved in certain legal and regulatory actions which  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for contingencies  it continually evaluates  and upon which  it makes various judgements and estimates 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
if the final outcome of these matters differs from the company s judgements and estimates  such differences could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
results of operations all comparisons are with the previous year  unless otherwise stated 
net revenues the company s unit volume is driven by product offerings  number of direct sales personnel  recurring sales and  to some extent  pricing

the company s customers are substantially dependent on retail sales  which are seasonal and subject to significant fluctuations and are difficult to predict 
such seasonality and fluctuations impact the company s sales 
historically  the company has experienced lower sales in the first half of each year

net loss earnings net loss earnings was million or per diluted share  million or 
per diluted share  and million or 
per diluted share for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the weighted average number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share computation were million  million  and million for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in the weighted average number of shares from to was primarily due to the conversion of the subordinated debentures being dilutive for fiscal but anti dilutive for fiscal and financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity needs have related to  and are expected to continue to relate to  capital investments  acquisitions  and working capital requirements 
the company has met its liquidity needs over the last three years primarily through funds provided by long term borrowings and  more recently  through cash generated from operations 
the company believes that cash provided from operating activities and funding available under its current credit agreements should be adequate to service debt  meet its capital investment and product development requirements  and satisfy any adverse judgement resulting from litigation in which it is currently a defendant 
the company s operating activities during fiscal generated approximately million compared to approximately million during this change from the prior year was primarily the result of a decrease in working capital 
in connection with the acquisition of meto ag  the company entered into a million six and one half year senior collateralized multi currency credit facility with a consortium of banks led by the company s principal lending bank

in addition  the jury held against the company on two tort claims related to tortious interference and unfair competition 
judgement was entered on the verdict in favor of the plaintiff  after trebling  in the amount of million plus attorneys fees and costs to be determined by the court 
the company is currently appealing the verdict see note of the consolidated financial statements and has posted a bond in the amount of million  principally secured by a letter of credit  and placed into escrow  shares of the company s treasury stock 
although management expects to prevail upon appeal  should the appeal be unsuccessful  management anticipates that the final judgement would not be paid prior to the end of and is of the opinion that the company will have sufficient financial resources in the form of cash and borrowing capacity  due to the cash flow generated during the intervening period  to satisfy any judgement 
the posting of additional security during the appeals process  the recording of a liability  or a final judgement  could cause the company to be in default of certain bank covenants 
in this event  management would pursue various alternatives  which may include  among other things  debt covenant waivers  debt covenant amendments  or refinancing of debt 
while management believes it would be successful in pursuing these alternatives  there can be no assurance of success

exposure to international operations the company manufactures products in the usa  the caribbean  europe  and the asia pacific region for both the local marketplace  as well as for export to its foreign subsidiaries 
the subsidiaries  in turn  sell these products to customers in their respective geographic areas of operation  generally in local currencies 
this method of sale and resale gives rise to the risk of gains or losses as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the company has been selectively purchasing currency exchange forward contracts on a regular basis to reduce the risks of currency fluctuations on short term receivables 
these contracts guarantee a predetermined exchange rate at the time the contract is purchased 
this allows the company to shift the risk  whether positive or negative  of currency fluctuations from the date of the contract to a third party 
as of december   the company had currency exchange forward contracts totaling approximately million 
the contracts are in the various local currencies covering primarily the company s western european operations along with the company s canadian and australian operations 
historically  the company has not purchased currency exchange forward contracts where it is not economically efficient  specifically for its operations in south america and asia 
the company has historically not used financial instruments to minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations on its net investments in and cash flows derived from its foreign subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk factors fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates affect the company s financial position and results of operations

the company has historically not used financial instruments to minimize its exposure to currency fluctuations on its net investments in and cash flows derived from its foreign subsidiaries 
see accounting for foreign currency translation and transactions in the summary of significant accounting policies  note of the consolidated financial statements  and financial instruments and risk management  note of the consolidated financial statements 
sensitivity of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices  which are reasonably possible over a one year period  are described below 
market values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on the market rates and prices 
the company s financial instruments subject to interest rate risk consist of the fixed rate million subordinated debentures 
these debt instruments have a net fair value of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in interest rates at december  would result in a million decrease in the net market value of the liability 
conversely  a basis point decrease in interest rates at december  would result in a million increase in the net market value of the liability 
the company s million subordinated debentures are also subject to equity price risk 
the fair value of these debentures was a liability of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the year end closing price of the company s common stock  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening in the company s common stock would result in a net increase in the fair value liability of million  while a weakening in the company s common stock could result in a net decrease in the fair value liability of million 
the company s financial instruments subject to foreign currency exchange risk include the eur million term loan  the million multi currency revolving credit facility  and the eur million and eur million capital leases 
at december   eur million approximately million was outstanding under the term loan 
the amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility was jpy million approximately million 
the outstanding amounts under the capital leases were eur million approximately million and eur million approximately million 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus the euro would result in a million decrease in the liability of the term loan  revolving credit facility  and capital leases  while a weakening of the us dollar versus the euro would result in a million increase in the liability of the term loan  revolving credit facility  and capital leases 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million decrease in the liability of the revolving credit facility  while a weakening of the us dollar versus the japanese yen would result in a million increase in the liability of the revolving credit facility 
also subject to foreign currency exchange risk are the company s foreign currency forward exchange contracts which represent a net asset position of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from year end levels  with all other variables held constant 
at december   a strengthening of the us dollar versus other currencies would result in an increase of million in the net asset position  while a weakening of the dollar versus all other currencies would result in a decrease of million 
foreign exchange forward contracts are used to hedge certain of the company s firm foreign currency cash flows 
thus  there is either an asset or cash flow exposure related to all the financial instruments in the above sensitivity analysis for which the impact of a movement in exchange rates would be in the opposite direction and substantially equal to the impact on the instruments in the analysis 
there are presently no significant restrictions on the remittance of funds generated by the company s operations outside the usa
