the imax r brand is recognized throughout the world for extraordinary and immersive family experiences 
as of december  there were theaters operating in more than countries 
the company derives revenue principally from long term theater system lease agreements  maintenance agreements  the distribution of films and film production agreements 
the company also derives revenue from its owned and operated theaters  camera rentals and post production services 
theater systems the company generally provides its theater systems to customers on a long term lease basis with initial lease terms of typically to years 
lease agreements typically provide for three major sources of revenue i initial rental fees  ii ongoing rental payments which include annual contractual minimum payments  and iii maintenance fees 
the initial rental fees vary depending on the type of system and location and generally are paid to the company in installments commencing upon the signing of the agreement 
ongoing rental payments are paid monthly over the term of the contract  commencing after system installation and are generally equal to the greater of a fixed minimum amount per annum or a percentage of box office receipts 
an annual maintenance fee is generally payable commencing in the second year of theater operations 
both minimum rental payments and maintenance fees are typically indexed to the consumer price index 
theater system leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to customers are classified as sales type leases as a result of meeting the criteria established by fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for leases 
all other leases are treated as operating leases 
revenue from sales type leases is recorded at the time the installation process is complete when  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
upon revenue recognition  the initial rental fees due under the contract  along with the present value of minimum ongoing rental payments are recorded as revenues and the related projector costs including installation expenses are recorded in cost of goods and services 
the company recognizes revenue on theater systems  sales type leases and sales at the time that installation is complete 
the company in certain circumstances sells its theater systems 
cash received in advance of installation is recorded as deferred revenue

at the time of installation  the deferred revenue is recognized in income  and the inventory costs are fully expensed 
the company is dependent in part on the viability of the north american commercial exhibitor market for collections under long term leases and for future system contracts 
in the last few years  many of the north american commercial exhibitor chains faced financial difficulties due to over expansion  which in some cases led to bankruptcy proceedings and or consolidations 
recently  many of these exhibitors have emerged from those proceedings with new capital 
some have raised capital in the public markets  while others have plans to do so 
while the company views these recent developments in the north american commercial exhibitor market as positive  there is no guarantee that they will continue 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d film production and distribution in accordance with sop accounting by producers or distributors of films  the company recognizes revenue from licensing of exhibition rights to motion pictures produced or distributed by the company when the film is complete and has been delivered  the license period has begun  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
where the license fees are based on a share of the customer s revenue  and all other revenue recognition criteria are met  the company recognizes revenue as the customer exhibits the film 
costs of producing films and acquiring film distribution rights are capitalized and amortized using the individual film forecast computation method  which amortizes film costs and accrues participation costs in the same ratio that current period actual revenue bears to estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenue as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
all advertising  exploitation costs and marketing costs are expensed as incurred 
the company has developed a proprietary  patent pending technology to digitally re master mm live action films into format film for exhibition in imax theaters 
this system  known as imax dmr  digitally enhances image resolution quality of mm motion picture films for projection on screens up to eight stories high and up to feet wide  while maintaining the visual clarity and sound quality for which imax films are known 
the company believes that this technology has opened the imax theater network up to potential releases of hollywood films including both library titles and simultaneous new releases 
the company believes that the development of this new technology is key to helping it execute on its strategy of growing its commercial theater network by becoming a new window for hollywood films 
while the company is optimistic about the imax dmr technology  there is no guarantee that it will be commercially successful 
international operations a significant portion of the company s sales are made to customers located outside of the united states and canada 
during  and    and  respectively  of the company s revenues were derived outside the united states and canada 
the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenues in the future 
the company is subject to risks associated with operating in foreign countries 
in order to minimize exposure to exchange rate risk  the company prices theater systems the largest component of revenues in us dollars except in canada and japan where they are priced in canadian dollars and japanese yen  respectively 
annual minimum rental payments and maintenance fees follow a similar currency policy 
accounting policies and estimates the company reports its results under both united states generally accepted accounting principles us gaap and canadian generally accepted accounting principles 
the financial statements and results referred to herein are reported under us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  net investment in leases  inventories  fixed and film assets  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  future expectations and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at the date of the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events that are continuous in nature 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the audited financial statements in item page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d significant accounting policies management considers the following critical accounting policies to have the most significant effect on its estimates  assumptions and judgements revenue recognition sales type leases of theater systems theater system leases that transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to customers are classified as sales type leases as a result of meeting the criteria established by fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fas 
when revenue is recognized  the initial rental fees due under the contract  along with the present value of minimum ongoing rental payments  are recorded as revenues for the period  and the related projector costs including installation expenses are recorded as cost of goods and services 
additional ongoing rentals in excess of minimums are recognized as revenue when reported by the theater operator  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues from sales type leases upon installation of the theater system 
revenue associated with a sales type lease is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
prior to january   the company recognized revenue using the same criteria  except that the time of delivery rather than completion of installation was used as the point at which revenue was recognized 
the timing of installation of the theater system is largely dependent on the timing of the construction of the customer s theater 
therefore  while revenue for theater systems is generally predictable on a long term basis  it can vary from quarter to quarter or year to year depending on the timing of installation 
the company monitors the performance of the theaters to which it has leased equipment 
when facts and circumstances indicate that it may need to change the terms of a lease which had previously been recorded as a sales type lease  the company evaluates the likely outcome of such negotiations 
a provision is recorded against the net investment in leases if the company believes that it is probable that the negotiation will result in a reduction in the minimum lease payments such that the lease will be reclassified as an operating lease 
the provision is equal to the excess of the carrying value of the net investment in lease over the fair value of the equipment 
if the company and a lessee agree to change the terms of the lease  other than by renewing the lease or extending its terms  management evaluates whether the new agreement would be classified as a sales type lease or an operating lease under the provisions of fas any adjustments which result from a change in classification from a sales type lease to an operating lease are reported as a charge to income during the period the change occurs 
from time to time  the company is involved in legal proceedings relating to terminated lease agreements 
when settlements are received  the company will allocate the total settlement to each of the elements based on their relative fair value 
operating leases of theater systems leases that do not transfer substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership to the customer are classified as operating leases 
for these leases  initial rental fees and minimum lease payments are recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the lease term 
additional rentals in excess of minimum annual amounts are recognized as revenue when reported by theater operators  provided that collection is reasonably assured 
page imax corporation item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cont d general cont d significant accounting policies cont d accounts receivable and net investment in leases the allowance for doubtful accounts and provision against the net investment in leases are based on the company s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer balances and the underlying asset value of the equipment under lease where applicable 
if there is a deterioration in a customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults under the terms of the leases are higher than the company s historical experience  the company s estimates of recoverability for these assets could be adversely affected 
inventories in establishing the appropriate provisions for theater systems inventory  management must make estimates of future events and conditions including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts  potential future signings  general economic conditions  technology factors  growth prospects within the customers ultimate marketplace and the market acceptance of the company s current and pending projection systems and film library 
if management estimates of these events and conditions  proves to be incorrect  it could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be adequate as at the balance sheet date 
goodwill the company adopted fas goodwill and other intangibles effective january  see note of the audited financial statements in item 
upon adoption of this standard  no impairment in goodwill was found to exist 
the company performs an impairment test on at least an annual basis and additionally  whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flows approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
any impairment loss would be expensed in the statement of operations 
fixed assets management reviews the carrying values of its fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
in performing its review for recoverability  management estimates the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of impairment losses is based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the fair value calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if the actual future cash flows are less than the company s estimates  future earnings could be adversely affected 
tax asset valuation as at december   the company has net deferred income tax assets of million  comprised of tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences  which can be utilized to reduce either taxable income or taxes otherwise payable in future years 
management assesses realization of these net deferred income tax assets based on all available evidence and has concluded that it is more likely than not that these net deferred income tax assets will be realized 
positive evidence includes  but is not limited to  the company s projected future earnings based on contracted sales backlog at december   and the ability to realize certain deferred income tax assets through loss and tax credit carryback strategies 
however  if the company s projected future earnings do not materialize  these net deferred income tax assets may not be realizable and the company may need to establish additional valuation allowances for all or a portion of the net deferred income tax assets 
as of december   the company had a net deferred income tax asset of million  against which the company is carrying a million valuation allowance

the company expects to implement fas by no later than the first quarter of  at which time the comparatives will be restated to classify the extraordinary gain on repurchase of convertible subordinated notes to be included within earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
in june  the fasb issued fas which replaces eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
eitf required an entity to record a liability for certain termination costs when it adopted a plan to restructure operations 
the fasb has concluded that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a liability 
under the new rules  exit costs and restructuring liabilities generally will be recognized only when incurred 
the provisions are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with earlier application encouraged 
the pronouncement has no current impact on the company s financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas  which provides alternate methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation prescribed by fas in addition  fas requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company has adopted fas for disclosure purposes only effective december  the company uses the black scholes option pricing model 
based on the company s experience and its perception of historical trends  current conditions  expected future developments  as well as other factors it believes are appropriate under the circumstances  it has elected to utilize a lower expected volatility percentage than it has in recent years  though there can be no assurances that this volatility percentage will be accurate 
the company intends to continue investigating alternative option pricing models in the next fiscal year as further discussions on this topic continue in the marketplace 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin will be effective for any guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements will be effective for the third quarter of fiscal the company is currently evaluating the effects of fin  however  it does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the objective of fin is not to restrict the use of variable interest entities but to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
until now  a company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the company
