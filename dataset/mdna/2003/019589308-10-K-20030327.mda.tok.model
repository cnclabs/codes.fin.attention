item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
general the major components of our business strategy are intended to maximize operating cash flows to enable us to continue to pay down debt 
these components are operating vertically integrated non hazardous solid waste service businesses with a high rate of waste internalization which is the process of transferring and disposing of waste we collect at our own landfills  managing these businesses locally with a strong operations focus on customer service  maintaining or improving our market position through internal development and incremental acquisitions  and maintaining the financial capacity and administrative systems and controls to support on going operations and future growth 
during  we generated revenues of billion  cash from operations of  million  reinvested million of capital into the business and reduced debt by million to billion at december  during  we experienced a decline in revenues and earnings primarily attributable to pricing pressures driven by the continued economic slowdown 
economic pressures have made it difficult to recover increases in costs caused by normal inflation  increases in medical  property and casualty insurance in excess of normal inflation  and the expansion in our field infrastructure implemented in to provide our field operators the ability and flexibility to manage more efficiently within the geographic area for which each is responsible 
revenues 
our revenues result primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we also generate revenue from the sale of recycled commodities 
revenue is recorded as services are provided  including instances where services are billed in advance of the service being provided 
the following tables show the percentage of our total reported revenues by service line and geographic areas 
revenues by service line in millions  except percentages years ended december  collection disposal recycling other intercompany reported revenues for and  collection revenues consist of revenues from commercial customers and revenues from residential customers 
for  collection revenues consist of revenues from commercial customers and revenues from residential customers 
revenues from landfills and transfer stations are included in disposal 

table of contents revenues by area in thousands  except percentages years ended december  eastern southern central western other total revenues see discussion in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements included under item herein 
amounts relate primarily to our subsidiaries which provide services throughout the organization 
as stated above  a component of our business strategy is to increase our revenue through internal growth which we intend to do by increasing volumes collected and disposed and by increasing the rates we charge for the services we provide 
the following table sets forth the components of our revenue internal growth for the periods indicated years ended december  internal growth excluding commodity price volume total internal growth including commodity internal growth is not a measure of operating performance under us gaap 
our method of calculation may differ from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
operating expenses 
cost of operations includes expenses related to labor  repairs and maintenance  equipment and facility rent  fuel  utilities and taxes  environmental compliance and remediation  safety and insurance  and costs of independent haulers transporting our waste to the disposal site 
additionally  cost of operations includes disposal costs which consists of third party disposal costs  landfill taxes  host community fees  landfill royalty payments  landfill site maintenance  fuel and other equipment operating expenses and increases in the accruals for estimated closure and post closure monitoring expenses 
billing system conversion  duplicative facilities and operations  loss contract provisions  and environmental matter costs resulting from acquisition activities are also included in cost of operations 
in addition  gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations are included in cost of operations 
selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation and overhead for corporate and field general management  accounting and finance  legal  management information systems and clerical and administrative departments  in addition to sales  investor and community relations and provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
included in selling  general and administrative expenses are the costs of transitional employees resulting from acquisition activities 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization costs associated with the acquisition and development of landfill airspace and intangible assets 
depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements years  vehicles and equipment years  containers and compactors years and furniture and office equipment years 
goodwill amortization includes the amortization of costs paid in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired prior to july  in purchase business combinations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill amortization ceased january  
table of contents other matters in june  the board of directors named pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc as our independent auditing firm  replacing arthur andersen llp 
in august  pwc completed a re audit of the financial statements at our request which resulted in no restatement of the financial results 
critical accounting judgments and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these judgments and estimates often involve future events 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
in addition  management has discussed these accounting policies and judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors 
no one geographic operating segment has more significant concentration of the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information available at the time of the valuations 
actual results may differ significantly from estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting judgments and estimates are based on our accounting practices in effect during we have noted examples of the residual accounting risk inherent for these areas that you should be aware of and for you to consider 
residual accounting risk is defined as the inherent risk that remains after the application of our policies and processes and is generally outside of our control 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk landfill accounting in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which outlines standards for accounting for an obligation associated with the retirement of a long lived tangible asset and the associated retirement costs 
this standard will impact our accounting for landfill closure and post closure obligations 
see note of our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for discussion of our adoption of sfas and the related impact to our landfill accounting 
the following discussion of our landfill accounting is based on our accounting practices in effect during  prior to the adoption of sfas we own a portfolio of active landfills with estimated remaining lives  based on current waste flows  which range from to over years  and an average remaining life of approximately years 
in addition to our portfolio of active landfills  we own or have responsibility for closed landfills that are no longer accepting waste 
we use the life cycle accounting method for landfills and the related closure and post closure liabilities 
in life cycle accounting  all costs to acquire  develop  close  and monitor a site during post closure are capitalized or accrued and charged to expense over the associated landfill capacity based upon the consumption of airspace 
our cost accumulation for recording the asset and liabilities related to landfills is driven by the technical design that is developed by a third party consultant and approved by a regulatory agency 
the technical design includes the construction and closure specifications and the types and quantities of materials required and determine the landfill capacity 
landfill capacity is updated periodically based on third party aerial surveys 
landfill asset and related amortization site permit and technical design in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal level 
the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the studies are typically prepared by third party consultants and changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to obtain a landfill permit 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk reviewed by our environmental management group 
the initial studies are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
studies performed by third parties could be inaccurate which could result in the revocation of a permit 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study which makes the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the revocation of a permit 
technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
these designs are compiled by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical design  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult or costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
third party designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs or difficulty in obtaining a permit 
landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are the factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on an average expected density to be achieved over the operating life of the landfill 
estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  leachate collection system construction  installation of methane gas monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
to review the adequacy of our cost estimates actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered by unexpected operating conditions 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk used in the annual update of the above costs  we compare estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  we review changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness  and we compare our resulting development cost per acre with prior periods 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
or altered by regulatory or legislation changes 
landfill amortization in order to match the amortization of the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
at the end of a landfill s operating life  the landfill asset is fully amortized 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value and estimated future development costs as described above of the landfill by the estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the costs are not inflated and discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to depreciation and amortization expense 
amortization rates per ton are influenced by the original cost basis for the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions in recent years and valued them at the time of acquisition based upon market value 
also  per ton rates are influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
the cost estimates are prepared by company and third party engineers based on the applicable local  state and federal requirements and site specific technical design requirements 
estimates of future disposal capacity are updated using aerial surveys of each landfill to estimate utilized disposal capacity and remaining disposal capacity 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually 
changes in the cost estimates are rates could change in the future based upon evaluations of new facts and circumstances relating to site permit and design criteria or development cost 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
summary during  we expensed approximately million  or an average of per ton consumed  related to landfill amortization as compared to million or an average of per ton consumed during we incurred landfill development costs of million and acquired million to the landfill assets during the net book value of our landfill assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december  we have available disposal capacity of approximately billion tons 
estimated total future development costs for our active landfills is approximately billion  excluding capitalized interest 
closure and post closure liabilities and related costs landfill closure design as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 
generally  closure requirements include the application of compacted clay  geosynthetic liners and vegetative soil barriers in addition to the construction of drainage channels and methane gas collection systems  among other closure activities 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 
post closure monitoring after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which usually extends for years 
post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and monitoring the methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  among other post closure activities 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas systems operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 
closure and post closure provision in order to match the cost of the closure and post closure requirements with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk accrue the closure and post closure costs on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill  over its operating life 
increases or decreases in the per ton rates used to accrue closure and post closure liabilities 
for each landfill  the per ton rate is calculated as follows the total estimated future costs required to close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit changes in future inflation rate projections could impact our actual future costs and our total liability 
is quantified 
the timing of the estimated future cash outflows is projected based on the anticipated waste flow into the landfill 
changes in risk free capital rates used to discount the liabilities could cause changes in our recorded liabilities and costs 
the expenditures are inflated based on an average cpi rate and discounted back to today s dollars using an average long term risk free rate of return 
we review historical interest rates for government backed bonds and other low risk investments to estimate the long term risk free rate of return 
for  the average cpi rate was and the long term risk free rate was 
the present value of the total closure and post closure costs for the landfill is divided by the estimated remaining disposal capacity of the landfill to calculate the per ton rate 
the disposal capacity for the closure and post closure rate is determined on the same basis as the landfill amortization rate previously described 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to cost of operations and an increase to the closure and post closure accrual 
the balance sheet accrual is increased by accreting the balance at the long term risk free rate and recorded as a charge to cost of operations 
actual cash expenditures reduce the accrual as they are incurred 
estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimate of future closure and post closure costs and estimates of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
cost estimates are prepared by internal and third party engineers based on the applicable local  state and federal regulations and the specifications detailed in the landfill permit 
revisions in estimates of our costs are treated prospectively for our operating landfills but are recorded immediately for closed landfills 
rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill closure design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk disposal capacity estimates are updated using aerial surveys of each landfill to estimate remaining disposal capacity 
summary during  we expensed approximately million  or an average of per ton consumed as compared to million or an average of per ton consumed during  related to provisions for closure and post closure accruals  including accretion 
during and  expenditures against these accruals were million and million  respectively 
we currently estimate total future payments for closure and post closure to be approximately billion 
the present value of such estimate is billion 
at december  and  accruals for landfill closure and post closure costs were million and million  respectively  which reflects the degree to which we have filled the landfill 
estimated remaining disposal capacity recognition criteria as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit obtained 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  which relates to additional disposal capacity being sought through means of an expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to achieve any of the criteria stated below or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both costs and disposal capacity will change  which will impact the rates we charge for landfill amortization and closure and post closure accruals 
we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought 
all geologic and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met or a variance from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be achieved 
the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk we are actively pursuing the expansion permit and an expectation that the final local  state and federal permits will be received within the next five years 
senior operations management approval has been obtained 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating the landfill amortization and closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
summary at december   we had billion tons of permitted disposal capacity  and at of our landfills  million tons of probable expansion disposal capacity 
during  we received permits for approximately million tons of disposal capacity that was previously classified as probable expansion 
during  we were not denied any expansions for which the disposal capacity was classified as probable expansion 
non recurring acquisition accruals nature of liabilities at the time of an acquisition accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  we evaluate and adjust existing accruals of the acquired company to represent our estimate of the future costs to settle the assumed obligations 
assumed liabilities as well as liabilities resulting directly from the completion of the acquisition are considered in the net assets acquired and resulting goodwill allocation 
there could be changes in circumstances or estimates that cause the actual settlement of these liabilities to be higher or lower than our original estimates 
liabilities resulting from changes in estimates of assumed obligations  including litigation  self insurance reserves and loss contracts  as well as liabilities related to restructuring and abandonment activities  are accrued at the time of acquisition through a charge to expense 
additionally  transition costs that are not accruable at the time of acquisition  including transitional personnel costs  route restructurings and costs associated with the consolidation of operations are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred 
additional liabilities may exist related to the acquired operations that have not been identified 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk estimate updates we evaluate the adequacy of the non recurring acquisition accruals at least annually by obtaining third party actuarial valuations of assumed self insurance obligations  third party legal counsel updates for assumed litigation and field and corporate management reviews of all acquisition related commitments 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
the adjustment is charged to either an expense or goodwill consistent with how the original liability was established and the period of time that has elapsed since the date of the acquisition 
generally  we do not record adjustments to goodwill after one year from the date of the acquisition 
summary at december  and  we had approximately million and million  respectively  of non recurring acquisition accruals remaining on our balance sheet  consisting primarily of loss contracts  litigation and compliance  and risk management and insurance liabilities associated with the acquisition of bfi 
cash paid against non recurring acquisition accruals  including severance in  was million and million in environmental liabilities including cercla or other environmental laws nature of liabilities liabilities arise from contamination existing at landfills or other properties and are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for incremental remediation activities and the related litigation costs 
to determine our ultimate liability at these sites  we have used third party environmental engineers and attorneys to assist in the evaluation of several factors  including the extent of contamination at each identified site and the most appropriate remedy 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
if these liabilities are assumed in connection with an acquisition  any increases in these accruals from the amounts recorded by the predecessor are charged to operating expense 
if the liabilities arise through the normal course of business  the accruals are also charged to operating expense 
actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  such as the extent of contamination at a particular site  the final remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties  and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liability as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remedial costs 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk estimate updates we periodically consult with outside legal counsel and environmental engineers to review the status of all environmental matters and to assist our environmental and legal management in updating our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of resolution 
as the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain  the accrued costs are not discounted 
any changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
summary we have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  represents the most probable outcome of these contingent matters 
cash paid for environmental matters during and was million and million  respectively 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we are partially self insured for general liability  automobile  and workers compensation insurance with varying loss thresholds up to million 
we are fully self insured for employee group health claims 
the self insurance portion of the liability for unpaid claims and associated expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined by a third party actuary and reflected in our balance sheet as an accrued liability 
we use a third party administrator to track and evaluate actual claims experience for consistency with the data used in the annual actuarial valuation 
the expense is charged to operating costs 
the actuarially determined liability is calculated in part by our past claims experience factor  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
as of december  and  we had approximately and of self insurance liabilities on our balance sheet 
cash paid for self insurance claims during and was million and million  respectively 
if we experience self insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  these estimates may increase or decrease 
incident rates  including frequency and severity  could increase or decrease during a year causing our actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease 
the costs to discharge our obligations  including legal costs and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current and or prior estimates of our self insurance liability to change 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we provide services to approximately million customers throughout the united states 
we perform credit evaluations of our significant customers and establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the adverse changes in the financial health of our customers could change the timing or levels of collections 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk aging of our receivables  payment performance factors  historical trends and other information 
in general  we reserve of receivables outstanding to days and of those outstanding over days 
we also review outstanding balances on an account specific basis and reserve the receivable if information becomes available indicating we will not receive payment 
our reserve is evaluated and revised on a monthly basis 
asset impairment valuation methodology we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets 
evaluation criteria we test long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest of certain assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
recognition criteria if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset  if the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
we use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
goodwill impairment valuation methodology we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on fair value of each geographic operating segment 
our geographic operating segment is an aggregate of several vertically integrated businesses with similar operational characteristics 
we estimate fair value based on net cash flows discounted using an estimated weighted average cost of capital of approximately 
in addition  consideration is also given to an earnings multiple approach  enterprise value and overall company market capitalization to evaluate the reasonableness of our discounted cash flows 
the estimated fair value could change as there are future changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  ability to perform at levels that were forecasted  actual capital expenditure levels  or our market capitalization 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value to below carrying value  which would trigger an impairment 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk evaluation criteria annually  we test realizability of goodwill 
in addition  we test goodwill for recoverability between annual evaluations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in legal factors  liquidity or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of an operating segment or a significant portion of a geographic operating segment 
similarly  an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment 
recognition criteria we recognize an impairment if net book value exceeds the fair value as determined using discounted future cash flows on a geographic operating segment basis 
at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within a geographic operating segment  goodwill is allocated to that business unit and a gain or loss on disposal is derived 
subsequently  the remaining goodwill in the geographic operating segment from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment  which could also result in an additional loss 
in the past  we have incurred non cash losses on sales of assets 
if similar divestiture decisions are made in the future  we could incur additional non cash losses on asset sales 
a divestiture of any individual asset below the geographic operating segment level could result in a loss 
summary at december  and  we had billion and billion of goodwill recorded 
upon adoption of sfas at january   we had no impairment of goodwill 
in addition  at december   we completed our annual evaluation of goodwill recoverability and there was no impairment of goodwill 
tax accruals we account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences in financial reporting and income tax basis of assets  other than non deductible goodwill  and liabilities 
the differences are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we utilize outside experts and legal counsel to assist in the development or review of significant tax positions used in establishing our liability 
the balance sheet classification and amount of the tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome of certain tax matters 
as these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting  any future changes relating to these amounts will result in balance sheet reclassifications  which may include an adjustment to 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk the acquisition of bfi in  which was accounted for as a business purchase combination  resulted in approximately billion of goodwill  billion of which the amortization is non deductible 
income tax expense is recorded on an interim basis based on the expected annual effective tax rate 
the effective tax rate is determined using estimated full year earnings  non deductible items and tax credits that are anticipated to be utilized 
summary as of december   net operating loss  capital loss  foreign tax credit and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling million remain unused that will expire if not used by the end of various future years 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that some of these carryforwards may not be used 
goodwill 
actual income tax rates can vary from period to period as a result of differences between estimated and actual earnings  non deductible items and tax credit utilization 
we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
positions taken in those and other tax years are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposures to tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
defined benefit pension plans recognition criteria we assumed two defined benefit retirement plans in connection with the acquisition of bfi  which were merged into one plan during the benefits of approximately of the plan participants were frozen upon acquisition 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense is actuarially determined by an independent third party based on actuarial assumptions 
we use a third party to administer the plan and maintain certain data that is provided to the actuary 
the plan assets are managed by a third party that is unaffiliated to our actuary 
we recognize in our financial statements an accrued liability or a prepaid pension expense  for the difference between the cost to satisfy our pension obligation and the investment income earned or contributions to the plan 
pension income or expense is recorded to selling  general and administrative expense 
our funding policy is to make annual contributions to the pension plan as determined to be required by the plan s actuary 
no contributions were required during the last three years 
no contributions are anticipated for the plan s policy is to invest the plan s assets as determined by our benefits committee 
at changes in our investment mix could impact the amount of 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk december   of the total plan assets of million  approximately was invested in fixed bond funds and approximately in equity funds 
pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 
assumptions the assumptions used in the actuarial determined funded status are as follows weighted average assumptions as of our measurement date  september discount rate expected return on plan assets average rate of compensation increase our discount rate represents the yield on investment grade bonds at which our obligation could be settled 
our discount rate is based on a review of the current rate of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
the long term bonds we use have a duration that is equivalent to our obligations under the plan 
our discount rate is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase the liability and decrease the funded status of the plan 
the expected return on our plan assets represents a long term view of returns based on our current asset mix 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluated an analysis of long term expected returns on the plan assets from our investment managers which gave consideration to our asset mix and anticipated length of obligation of our plan 
the fair value of the plan assets is impacted by general market conditions 
if actual return on plan assets varies from the expected returns  actual results could differ 
the average rate of compensation increase applies only to the portion of the plan that is not frozen 
less than of the plan participants continue to earn benefits 
this rate reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the period benefits are earned 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting area use of estimates accounting risk we annually review our actual asset allocation  discount rate  expected rate of return and other actuarial assumptions and adjust them as deemed necessary 
changes in our key assumptions could cause changes in our assets  liabilities and income or expense recorded 
for example  a decrease in the discount rate would result in a greater benefits obligation and more pension expense in future periods 
a lower expected return on assets would decrease the plan assets and increase the amount of pension expense recorded 
summary at our measurement date of september   the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the market value of the underlying pension assets due to an overall decline in the fair value of the assets and an increase in our discount rate assumption 
as a result  we were required under sfas to record an accrued benefit liability of million 
this non cash adjustment resulted in an after tax charge to other comprehensive income of million  reflected as a reduction to shareholders equity 
this adjustment did not impact net income 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet reflected a prepaid pension asset of million 
future actual pension income will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the plan s specific beneficiary population 
we recorded pension income of million and million during and  respectively 
we anticipate the pension expense in to be approximately million 
the plan paid benefits of approximately million and million for the plan years ended september  and  respectively 
because the majority of the plan is frozen  we anticipate fairly constant benefit payments in the future

table of contents years ended december  and during  we experienced a decline in revenues and earnings primarily attributable to pricing pressures driven by the continued economic slowdown 
the slowing economy and other competitive conditions have resulted in reductions in our overall average price per unit of and up to in certain lines of business 
economic pressures have prevented us from recovering increases in costs caused by normal inflation  unusually large increases in medical  property and casualty insurance costs and the expanded field infrastructure 
revenues 
revenues in were billion compared to billion in a decrease of or million 
the decrease is attributable to million related to a decline in per unit pricing  partially offset by an increase in volumes of million 
during  pricing pressures were primarily experienced in the landfill  roll off and commercial collection businesses 
the residential collection business remained fairly constant 
landfill volumes increased by  partially offset by decrease in landfill pricing when compared to additionally  increases in commodity revenues and net acquired revenues were offset by decreases in other non core revenues 
commodity revenues increased as a result of increases in the average price per ton  while volumes remained fairly constant when comparing to cost of operations 
cost of operations in was billion compared to billion in  an increase of or million

table of contents we have historically operated and we expect that we will continue to operate with a working capital deficit 
this deficit  in part  is caused by the current portion of our outstanding debt 
we regularly use excess available cash from operating and non operating activities to pay the current portion of our outstanding debt 
to the extent excess cash from operations exceeds our scheduled debt maturities  we prepay future maturities 
our financing strategy for market development is to utilize cash flow from divestiture activity to repay debt and to fund any acquisition activity 
in addition to funding our operational working capital and debt reduction needs  we are committed to investing capital in our asset base 
our capital expenditures are primarily for the construction and build out of our landfills  for the trucks and containers used by our collection operations and heavy equipment used in both our collection and landfill operations and are expected to average of revenue 
following is a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended december  in millions trucks  containers and heavy equipment landfill development other total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions includes land and improvements  land held for permitting as landfills  buildings and improvements  and furniture and office equipment

the other long term liabilities consist primarily of non recurring acquisition accruals  derivative liabilities for interest rate swap contracts  accrued insurance and other miscellaneous long term obligations 
in addition to the million of other long term liabilities identified above  we have million of derivative liability for interest rate swaps  which is paid through interest expense payments over the life of the swap contracts 
the contracts mature at various times between and see discussion in footnote of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item herein 
we also have million of net pension liability included in long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet  however  this liability is not included in the table above as these are not cash obligations 
our credit facility has certain provisions  calculated annually  which accelerate repayments of principal under the term loans if we generate cash flow in excess of certain levels 
this could result in usage of the revolving loan facility to accommodate cash timing differences 
factors primarily causing excess cash flow  as defined  could include increases in operating cash flow  lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements  net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities 
cash flow available to repay debt in excess of the current year s maturities will be ratably applied to future maturities 
our credit facility and the indentures relating to our senior subordinated notes and our senior notes contain financial covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions

our ability to pay dividends on preferred and common stock is most significantly limited by our credit facility  which specifies that in order to pay cash dividends  the ratio of total debt ebitda must be less than this ratio was at december  and therefore we are currently precluded from the payment of cash dividends 
shares of our series a senior convertible preferred stock are entitled to cumulative quarterly dividends in an amount equal to per annum 
beginning july   the dividend rate on the series a senior convertible preferred stock increases to per annum for any dividends that are not paid in cash 
there are circumstances under which we would not be required to accrue dividends at the rate 
as long as we have a total debt ebitda ratio of less than  under our credit facility  we would be able to pay cash dividends at the rate 

table of contents we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy the financial assurance requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
additionally  we are required to provide financial assurance for our self insurance program and collateral required for certain performance obligations 
during  we expect no material increase in financial assurance obligations although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
at december   we had the following financial assurance instruments in thousands landfill closure contract risk casualty collateral for post closure performance insurance obligations total insurance policies surety bonds trust deposits letters of credit total these amounts are issued under the revolving credit facility of our credit facility 
these financial assurance instruments are issued in the normal course of business 
they are not debt and  therefore  are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments would be valued and recorded in the consolidated balance sheets if it is probable that we would be unable to perform our obligations under the financial assurance contracts 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet financing we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments discussed above which are not debt 
we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed  consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
significant financing events in in november  through the issuance of million of senior notes due  we refinanced approximately million of our credit facility with fixed rate bonds 
additionally  in august  we repaid the subsidiaries line of credit before its maturity date 
the subsidiaries line of credit was repaid with the cash from operations and the revolving credit facility under the credit facility 
at december   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that would allow us to issue equity and or debt securities up to billion from time to time as determined by the board of directors and as market conditions permit 
the registration statement was declared effective by the sec on december  we expect to use the net proceeds from any issuances of securities under the shelf registration for general corporate purposes  including repaying or refinancing bank borrowings and for working capital  capital expenditures and other acquisitions 

table of contents financing plan we are a highly leveraged company with billion of outstanding debt at december  the vast majority of our debt was incurred to acquire solid waste companies during the past years 
our debt maturity schedule reflects annual scheduled payments of million  million and million for  and  respectively 
our first objective is to address maturities under the credit facility 
in the future  we expect to continue to repay debt with cash flow from operations and it is possible that we will endeavor to refinance our debt obligations to extend maturities 
the revolving credit facility component of the credit facility expires in july during  we intend to take actions towards refinancing the credit facility 
both the term loan market and revolver market have contracted over the past years due  we believe  to consolidation in the banking industry  demands for increased returns within the banking industry and the reduction in average lender hold positions 
accordingly  we recognize that we will need to continue to reduce the size of the credit facility in order to effectively put in place a new credit facility 
the billion credit facility has already been reduced to billion at december  through the application of cash flow from operations  net proceeds from divestitures and offerings of senior notes 
we believe that between december  and the time we refinance the credit facility  we will further reduce its size to approximately billion 
we believe we have several alternatives available to us that will allow this reduction to occur 
the alternatives include continued application of cash flow from operating activities  possible asset divestitures in excess of acquisitions and potential capital market transactions 
capital market transactions could involve either new capital for us or refinancing short term maturities for longer term maturities or some combination of both 
our course of action is subject to ongoing analysis and consideration of the economic environment 
the exact size  combination or timing of these events is subject to various considerations  some of which are out of our control  and we cannot assume that we will be able to secure a refinancing on terms we regard as favorable  or at all 
increase in authorized shares on january   a special meeting of our stockholders was held at which we submitted to a vote of our stockholders  and obtained approval  for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock from million to million 

table of contents interest rate swap portfolio consistent with our risk management policy  we have entered into floating rate to fixed rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt 
our strategy is to use floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements when such transactions will serve to reduce our aggregate exposure 
we enter into these contracts solely for the purpose of reducing variable interest rate risk  positions are not taken for trading purposes 
our risk management policy requires that we evaluate the credit of our counterparties and that we monitor counterparty exposure 
at december   counterparties for of our interest rate swap portfolio were rated aa the counterparty for the remaining is rated a our interest rate swap portfolio continues to fix of our variable rate interest payment obligation  protecting us from cash flow variations arising from changes in short term interest rates 
we believe this is prudent given our capital structure 
at december   we had billion of notional amount of interest rate swap contracts with a weighted average months to maturity 
these contracts expire as follows million during  billion during and million during our corporate policy is that at least of our total debt must be effectively fixed  either directly or through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly  and through interest rate swap agreements 
the average interest rate paid under swap contracts at december  was compared to libor of 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  accounting for derivative and hedging activities sfas as amended by sfas  accounting for certain derivative and hedging activities sfas  a portion of our interest rate swap portfolio was de designated for hedge accounting purposes at december  these contracts remain in place and continue to protect us from cash flow variability 
at the time debt obligations are repaid prior to maturity  we may or may not terminate interest rate swap contracts depending on the reflective economic considerations

table of contents contingencies we are currently under examination by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
a federal income tax audit for the years ended december  and is ongoing 
a federal income tax audit for bfi s tax years ended september  through july  is completed with the exception of the matter discussed below 
during  we received notification from the irs disallowing all of a capital loss included in bfi s july  tax return 
if such disallowance is upheld  we estimate it could have a federal and state income tax effect of up to million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million 
we also received a notification from the irs assessing a penalty of between and of the additional income tax resulting from the disallowance 
because of several meritorious defenses  we believe the successful assertion of penalties is remote 
in october  the irs issued a revenue procedure outlining two resolution alternatives related to this matter 
taxpayers could elect to participate under this revenue procedure if certain eligibility requirements were met 
we decided not to participate under this irs issuance 
we continue to believe our position is well supported and we will vigorously contest the disallowance 
the resolution of this matter may entail efforts including administrative appeals and litigation which could extend over several years 
an unfavorable result could require future cash expenditures but should have minimal  if any  impact on our consolidated results of operations as the amount has been fully reserved for on our consolidated balance sheet 
we enter into contracts in the normal course of business that include indemnification clauses 
indemnifications relating to known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on our best estimate of required future payments 
we are not able to determine potential future payments for indemnifications that relate to contingent events or occurrences  such as the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation of the tax law  and indemnifications made in divestiture agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that may become known in the future but that relate to our activities prior to the divestiture 
subtitle d and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities

all statements  other than statements of historical fact included in this report  are forward looking statements 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
generally  these forward looking statements include  among others  statements regarding our business plans or strategies  projected or anticipated benefits or other consequences of such plans or strategies  the adequacy of our cash flow to make payments on our indebtedness and fund other liquidity needs  our expectation that we will spend approximately million on capital expenditures  closure  post closure and remediation expenditures related to landfill operations in  our expectations that total capital expenditures will be approximately of revenues in  our ability to increase revenue growth and internal growth by increasing volumes collected and disposed and by increasing the rates for the services we provide  our financing plan including  without limitation  our expectation of refinancing the credit facility  our ability to perform our obligations under financial assurance contracts and our ability to maintain the current amount and mix of financial assurance contracts  underlying assumptions including internal growth as well as general economic and financial market conditions  our expectation that our casualty  property or environmental claims or other contingencies will not have a material effect on our operations  our estimate of federal and state income taxes and penalties required to be paid if we do not prevail in our appeal of the irs disallowance of capital losses related to bfi  and our belief that the costs of settlements or judgments arising from litigation and the effects of settlements or judgments on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operation will not be material 
all phases of our operations are subject to a number of uncertainties  risks and other influences  many of which are outside of our control and any one of which  or a combination of which  could materially affect the results of our operations 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations are discussed below 
these risks and uncertainties include  without limitations our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to service our debt and operate our business 
we have had and will likely continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness with significant debt service requirements 
at december   our consolidated debt was approximately billion and our debt to total capitalization was 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences 
for example  it could 
table of contents make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes  increase our vulnerability to economic downturns in our industry  increase our vulnerability to interest rate increases to the extent any of our variable rate debt is not hedged  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to cash flow  limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and our industry  limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds or obtain other financing capacity  and subject us to a greater risk of noncompliance with financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could have a material negative effect on us 
we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future 
as of december   our debt agreements permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness under various financial ratio tests 
as of december   we had no cash draws outstanding under our billion revolving credit facility 
as of such date  we had million in letters of credit drawn on the revolving credit facility that support financial assurance purposes  leaving million of availability 
to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash flow in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may be unable to refinance our indebtedness 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may also need to refinance our senior notes  our senior subordinated notes and or other indebtedness to pay the principal amounts due at maturity 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain sufficient funds to enable us to repay or refinance our debt obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
covenants in our credit facility  our indentures and the instruments governing our other indebtedness may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facility  and certain of the agreements governing our other indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless we satisfy certain financial tests or other criteria 
we must also comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests 
in some cases  our subsidiaries are subject to similar restrictions which may restrict their ability to make distributions to us 
our credit facility and these other agreements contain additional affirmative and negative covenants  including limitation on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and to make acquisitions and capital expenditures 
all of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 

table of contents if we do not comply with these covenants and restrictions  we could be in default under our credit facility and other debt agreements and the debt  together with accrued interest  could then be declared immediately due and payable 
if we default under our credit facility  the lenders could cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under such credit facility to become due and payable  require us to apply all of our cash to repay the indebtedness under such credit facility or prevent us from making debt service payments on any other indebtedness we owe 
if we are unable to repay any borrowings when due  the lenders under our credit facility could proceed against their collateral  which includes most of the assets we own  including the stock and assets of our subsidiaries 
in addition  any default under our credit facility or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under our other debt instruments that contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
our ability to comply with these provisions of our credit facility and other agreements governing our other indebtedness may be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control 
we compete with large companies and municipalities that may have greater financial and operational resources 
we also compete with the use of alternatives to landfill disposal in part because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal and we cannot assure you that we will continue to operate our landfills at currently estimated volumes 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is highly competitive 
we compete with large companies and municipalities which may have greater financial and operational resources 
the non hazardous waste collection and disposal industry is led by three large national waste management companies allied  waste management  inc  and republic services  inc 
it also includes numerous regional and local companies 
many counties and municipalities that operate their own waste collection and disposal facilities have the benefits of tax exempt financing and may control the disposal of waste collected within their jurisdictions 
we encounter competition due to the use of alternatives to landfill disposal  such as recycling and incineration  because of state requirements to reduce landfill disposal and we cannot ensure that our landfills will continue to operate at currently estimated volumes 
further  most of the states or municipalities in which we operate landfills require counties and municipalities to formulate comprehensive plans to reduce the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills through waste planning  composting and recycling or other programs 
some state and local governments mandate waste reduction at the source and prohibit the disposal of certain types of wastes  such as yard wastes  at landfills 
these actions may reduce the volume of waste going to landfills in certain areas 
if this occurs  we cannot assure that we will be able to operate our landfills at their current estimated volumes or charge current prices for landfill disposal services due to the decrease in demand for services 
if we are unable to execute our business strategy  our waste disposal expenses could increase significantly 
over the long term  our ability to continue to sustain our current vertical integration strategy will depend on our ability to maintain appropriate landfill capacity  collection operations and transfer stations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace such assets either timely or cost effectively or integrate acquisition candidates effectively or profitably 
further  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in expanding the permitted capacity of our current landfills once our landfill capacity is full 
in such event  we may have to dispose of collected waste at landfills operated by our competitors or haul the waste long distances at a higher cost to another of our landfills  either of which could significantly increase our waste disposal expenses 
we may be unable to obtain required permits 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain the permits we require to operate our business because permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills and to expand the permitted capacity of existing landfills have become increasingly difficult and expensive to obtain 
permits often take years to obtain as a result of numerous hearings and compliance with zoning  environmental and other regulatory measures 
these permits are also often subject to resistance from citizen or other groups and other political pressures 
our failure to obtain the required permits to operate non hazardous solid waste landfills could have a material negative effect on our future results of operations 

table of contents the solid waste industry is a capital intensive industry that may consume cash from our operations and borrowings 
our ability to remain competitive  grow and expand operations largely depends on our cash flow from operations and access to capital 
we spent approximately million in combination for our capital expenditures and capping  closure  and post closure and remediation expenditures related to our landfill operations during  and we expect to spend approximately million for these purposes in if we undertake more acquisitions or further expand our operations  the amount we expend on capital  capping  closure  and post closure and remediation expenditures may increase 
acquisitions may increase our capital requirements because acquisitions may require sizable amounts of capital  and competition with other solid waste companies that have a similar acquisition strategy may increase costs 
increases in expenditures may result in low levels of working capital or require us to finance working capital deficits 
we intend to continue to fund our cash needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility  if necessary 
however  we may require additional equity and or debt financing for debt repayment obligations and to fund our growth 
our cash needs will increase if the expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring increase above the reserves recorded for these costs 
expenditures for these costs may increase as a result of any federal  state or local government regulatory action  including changes in closing or monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used or the period of required post closure monitoring 
these factors  together with those discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and therefore impair our ability to invest in our existing facilities or new facilities 
we may not be able to obtain necessary financial assurances 
we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations and collection contracts 
in addition  we are required to provide financial assurances for our self insurance program 
we satisfy the financial assurances requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
as of december   we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining the financial assurances that we need and we do not have any indications that we will not have continued availability of these types of instruments 
however  we cannot make any assurances that the level of financial assurance that we are required to provide will be available in the future 
changes in interest rates may effect our results of operations 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  directly and through interest rate swap agreements 
the amount of this swap contract portfolio was billion 
for certain interest rate swap agreements  we record non cash mark to market gains and losses based on changes in future yield curves to the statement of operations 
changes in the yield curves could result in additional non cash losses being recorded in the statement of operations 
continued downturn in us economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our operating performance and results of operations 
our business is affected by general economic conditions 
the continued weakness in the us economy has had a negative effect on our operating results  including decreases in revenues and operating cash flows 
additionally  as is expected in a down cycle economic environment  we have experienced the negative effects of increased competitive pricing pressure and customer turnover 
if economic conditions continue to deteriorate or fail to recover  we will continue to experience pressure on the pricing that we are able to achieve for our services 
in addition  worsening economic conditions may lead to further negative effects of customer turnover 
there can be no assurance that current economic conditions or worsening economic conditions or a prolonged or recurring recession will not have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
we may be affected by adverse weather conditions 
our collection and landfill operations could be adversely affected by long periods of inclement weather which interfere with collection and landfill operations  delay the development of landfill capacity and or reduce the volume of waste generated by our customers 
in addition  certain of our operations may be temporarily suspended as a result of particularly harsh weather conditions 
severe weather can negatively affect the costs of collection and disposal 
long periods of inclement weather could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents loss of key executives and failure to attract qualified management could limit our growth and negatively impact our operations 
we depend highly upon our senior management team 
we will continue to depend on operations management personnel with waste industry experience 
we do not know the availability of such experienced management personnel or how much it may cost to attract and retain such personnel 
the loss of the services of any member of senior management or the inability to hire experienced operations management personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to costly environmental regulations and environmental litigation 
our equipment  facilities  and operations are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational health and safety 
these include  among other things  laws and regulations governing the use  treatment  storage  and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes and materials  air quality  water quality and the remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances 
our compliance with these regulatory requirements is costly 
government laws and regulations often require us to enhance or replace our equipment and to modify landfill operations or initiate final closure of a landfill 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset the cost of complying with these laws and regulations 
in addition  environmental regulatory changes could accelerate or increase expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring at solid waste facilities and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently accrued for such purposes 
in addition to the costs of complying with environmental regulations  we incur costs to defend against litigation brought by government agencies and private parties who allege we are in violation of our permits 
as a result  we may be required to pay fines or our permits and licenses may be modified or revoked 
we are  and also may be in the future  defendants in lawsuits brought by governmental agencies and surrounding landowners who assert claims alleging environmental damage  personal injury  property damage and or violations of permits and licenses by us 
a significant judgment against us  the loss of a significant permit or license or the imposition of a significant fine could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
certain of our waste disposal operations traverse state and county boundaries 
in the future  our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by proposed federal legislation that authorizes the states to enact legislation governing interstate shipments of waste 
such proposed federal legislation may allow individual states to prohibit or limit importing out of state waste to be disposed of and may require states  under some circumstances  to reduce the amount of waste exported to other states 
if this or similar legislation is enacted in states in which we operate landfills that receive a significant portion of waste originating from out of state  our operations could be negatively affected 
we believe that several states have proposed or have considered adopting legislation that would regulate the interstate transportation and disposal of waste in the states landfills 
our collection  transfer and landfill operations may also be affected by flow control legislation which may be proposed in the united states congress 
this proposed federal legislation may allow states and local governments to direct waste generated within their jurisdictions to a specific facility for disposal or processing 
if this or similar legislation is enacted  state or local governments with jurisdiction over our landfills could act to limit or prohibit disposal or processing of waste in our landfills 
we may have potential environmental liabilities that are greater than our insurance coverage 
we may incur liabilities for the deterioration of the environment as a result of our operations 
any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
due to the limited nature of our insurance coverage of environmental liability  if we were to incur substantial financial liability for environmental damage  our business and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may have additional hazardous substances liability 
we are a potentially responsible party at many sites under the cercla and analogous state laws 
cercla provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes strict  joint and several liability on current and former owners or operators of a facility at which there has been a release or a threatened release of a hazardous substance  on persons who arrange for the disposal of such substances at the facility and on persons who transport such substances to the facility 
hundreds of substances are defined as hazardous under cercla and their presence  even in minute amounts  can result in substantial liability 
as used in this report  non hazardous waste means substances that are not defined as hazardous waste under federal regulations 
the statute provides for the remediation of contaminated facilities and imposes costs on the responsible parties 
the expense of conducting such a cleanup can be significant 
we have significant liabilities under these laws  primarily due to acquired businesses and properties and their former operations 
notwithstanding our efforts to comply with applicable regulations and to avoid transporting and receiving hazardous substances  we may have additional liability because such substances may be present in waste collected by us or disposed of in our landfills  or in waste collected  transported or disposed of in the past by acquired companies 
in addition  actual costs for these liabilities could be significantly greater than amounts presently accrued for these purposes 
there may be undisclosed liabilities associated with our acquisitions 
in connection with any acquisition made by us  there may be liabilities that we fail to discover or are unable to discover including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners and for which we  as successor owner  may be responsible 
similarly  we incur capitalized costs associated with acquisitions  which may never be consummated  resulting in a potential charge to earnings 
we are subject to examination by various federal and state taxing authorities 
we are currently under examination by various federal and state taxing authorities for certain tax years 
any material disagreement with a taxing authorities could result in large cash expenditures and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
a federal income tax audit for the years ended december  and is ongoing 
a federal income tax audit for bfi s tax years ended september  through july   is completed with the exception of the matter discussed below 
during the second quarter of  we received notification from the internal revenue service irs disallowing all of a capital loss included in bfi s july  tax return 
if such disallowance is upheld  we estimate it could have a federal and state income tax effect of up to million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million 
we also received notification from the irs assessing a penalty of between and of the additional income tax resulting from the disallowance 
in october  the irs issued a revenue procedure outlining two resolution alternatives related to this matter 
taxpayers could elect to participate under this revenue procedure if certain eligibility requirements were met 
we decided not to participate under this irs issuance 
we believe that the resolution of this matter may entail efforts including administrative appeals and litigation extending over several years 
an unfavorable result of this matter could require future potential cash expenditures that could have a material negative effect on our financial condition 
fluctuations in commodity prices could affect our operating results 
as part of our recycling services  we process recyclable materials such as paper  cardboard  plastics  aluminum and other metals for sale to third parties  generally at current market prices 
all of these materials are subject to significant price fluctuations  which are driven by general market conditions 
these price fluctuations may affect our future operating income and cash flows 
inflation and prevailing economic conditions our objective is to be able to implement price increases sufficient to offset most cost increases resulting from inflation 
however  competitive factors have and may continue to require us to absorb cost increases resulting from inflation 
as a result  we have been unable to implement price increases sufficient to offset cost increases resulting from inflation 
consistent with industry practice  most of our contracts provide for a pass through of certain costs  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
we are unable to determine the future impact of a sustained economic slowdown 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
to reduce the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we enter into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we have effectively converted a significant portion of our long term debt  which required payment at variable rates of interest  to fixed rate obligations through interest rate swap transactions 
during  these transactions required us to pay fixed rates of interest on notional amounts of principal to counter parties 
the counter parties  in turn  paid to us variable rates of interest on the same notional amounts of principal 
increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact earnings and cash flow in as a significant portion of variable rate debt had been swapped for fixed rates 
the following interest rate table summarizes all interest rate swaps that were in effect and their fair value as of december  fair market notional principal underlying value in thousands maturity interest paid obligations interest received in thousands credit agreement  january march term loan facility libor  at december   with of our debt fixed either directly or through interest rate swap agreements  we have million of floating rate debt 
if interest rates increased by basis points  annualized interest expense would increase by million million after tax 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that declining interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings nor the favorable impact they would have on interest expense and cash payments for interest 
accordingly  any changes in interest rates would have a minimal impact on our net income 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk
