item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations following are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgements involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
certain of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable and deferred income taxes 
these policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our financial statements as of a given date 
however  since our business cycle is relatively short  actual results related to the estimates relative to uncollectible accounts receivable are generally known within the six month period following the financial statement date 
thus  these policies generally affect only the timing of reported amounts across two to three quarters 
the estimate of deferred tax assets may affect reported amounts beyond that time period 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in materially different amounts being reported 
recognition of revenue revenue from advertising contracts is recognized ratably over the contract term  and the estimated cost components of a contract cost of the advertising space and the costs of producing and installing advertising copy are deferred and matched against the periodic recognition of revenue on essentially a straight line basis 
this method also necessitates the recognition of an unearned revenue liability for billings to customers for time periods beyond the end of the current accounting cycle 
discontinued operations effective during its fiscal year ending november   the company adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 
and no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas and accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
pursuant to these pronouncements  the company has classified as discontinued operations the results of operations and any exit costs associated with transit district contracts that were targeted for exit during the year 
as a result the company has no further involvement with these markets 
the us transit districts included in discontinued operations are chicago  san antonio  cincinnati  and kitsap 
the canadian transit districts included are pickering  whitby  cambridge and st 
catharines 
results of operations for these transit districts for have been reclassified to discontinued operations for comparability purposes 
there were no discontinued operations to report in reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectiblity of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses  the aging spread of accounts at the date the estimate is made  trends in the overall media economy  and general business conditions 
historically  losses from uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our reserves except that writeoffs exceeded reserves by approximately  in fiscal and million in fiscal since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a credit or charge to administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
income taxes we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets  when necessary  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
at least quarterly  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we believe recovery is unlikely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in a charge to income tax expense 
a decrease in the valuation allowance would result in a reduction to income tax expense 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision is in accordance with the annual anticipated rate 
property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets property  plant and equipment  including buildings  equipment  and computer hardware and software is recorded at cost including  in some cases  the cost of internal labor and is depreciated over estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances or changes to our business operations can result in differences between the actual and estimated useful lives 
in those cases were we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be shortened  we increase depreciation expense over the remaining estimated useful life to depreciate the asset to its salvage value 
on june   the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite economic useful lives 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  obie will adopt sfas effective december  as of november  obie had net unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete this first step 
obie expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment testing during the first quarter of the year ending november  fiscal year 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal year the company does not believe that the result of these impairment tests will have a material effect on the company s earnings and financial position 
as a result of adopting sfas we will no longer amortize goodwill 
we would have amortized  related to goodwill balances in fiscal other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual  employment relationships and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgements about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
overview obie media is an out of home advertising company that markets advertising space primarily on transit vehicles and outdoor advertising displays billboards and wallscapes 
as of november   obie had exclusive agreements with transit districts in the united states and canada to operate transit advertising displays 
since obie s ipo in november  the number of vehicles on which we have the right to operate transit advertising displays has increased from approximately  to over  we also operate and generally own more than  advertising displays on billboards and walls primarily in washington  oregon  montana  wyoming  california and idaho 
on december  the company received notice from the chicago transit authority cta that it was terminating the company s transit advertising agreement effective as of that date 
the company and the cta had been disputing settlement of transit fees in light of the nature of the early termination and a shortage of advertising space made available to the company  and the parties entered into an agreement as of may  resolving all of the outstanding issues 
the agreed upon fee for the contract year has been settled with the cta at million  substantially less than the original contracted guaranteed payment of million 
as of may   approximately million had been paid to the cta  and an additional million was paid on june  the balance is payable in substantially equal monthly payments of  beginning june and ending may  with an additional million balloon payment due on january  the monthly payments are without interest through may  and include a interest charge thereafter 
these periodic deferred payments have been valued using a junior unsecured discount rate of  resulting in a present value of million  which is included within long term debt in our balance sheet 
the result is a present value of million for the settlement 
the cost of the settlement is covered by previous accruals  including an accrual which the company established in the third quarter of fiscal a substantial portion of our loss for fiscal resulted from our payment of minimum advertising revenues guaranteed to transit districts under our transit district contracts 
beginning in the latter half of fiscal we became increasingly concerned about these minimum revenue guarantees in the face of declining advertising revenues in some transportation districts 
accordingly  we began to seek to restructure or terminate certain of these arrangements in a way that would limit obie s exposure to these payments to an amount that would reflect a more appropriate sharing of revenues under our advertising contracts 
between august  and february   we have renegotiated contracts that have resulted in transit guarantee reductions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal it cannot be assured that we will be able to eliminate or further reduce this type of risk and  if not  we may experience further adverse impacts on our operating revenues  some or all of which may be material 
in addition  during fiscal  transit contract bids occurred in our transit markets of austin  dallas and san antonio  texas  kansas city  cincinnati buses and santa cruz and sacramento  california 
we were awarded new contracts in kansas city  dallas and sacramento as we were the high bidder for those contracts 
a decision is still pending for santa cruz 
in the other markets mentioned above  except for austin  we had been experiencing significant operating losses due primarily to the high minimum guaranteed payments to the transit authorities 
in our rebids of these markets we substantially reduced the amounts offered as guaranteed payments  and as a result  the contracts were awarded to others 
we also terminated contracts in st 
catharines  pickering and whitby  all in the canadian province of ontario 
since we have exited these markets  the results of operations of these markets  plus the results relative to the chicago market termination and settlement described above  have been classified as results from discontinued operations in our statement of operations 
obie s operating results are affected by general economic conditions  as well as trends in the advertising industry 
moreover  our historical growth has primarily resulted from i growth in our transit advertising business  primarily resulting from new agreements with additional transit districts  ii the acquisition of p c on september   and iii the development and acquisition of new outdoor displays 
as a result of these factors  our operating performance is not necessarily comparable on a period to period basis 
we plan to continue expanding through both internal growth and acquisitions 
operating results the following table presents certain items from obie media s consolidated statements of income and ebitda as a percentage of net revenues 
year ended november transit net advertising revenue outdoor net advertising revenue net revenues operating expenses production  occupancy and selling general and administrative start up costs depreciation and amortization operating income loss interest expense income loss before income taxes and discontinued operations provision for benefit from income taxes income loss from continuing operations results of discontinued operations net income loss ebitda ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  a non gaap financial measure  is defined as operating income loss before depreciation and amortization expense 
while ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income loss  cash provided by operating activities or other income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or as a measure of profitability or liquidity  management believes that it is widely used by some investors as one measure to evaluate the financial performance of companies in the out of home advertising industry 
accordingly  this information has been disclosed to facilitate the comparative analysis of obie s operating performance relative to other companies in the out of home advertising industry 
comparison of years ended november  and results of continuing operations revenues 
obie s revenues are derived from sales of advertising on out of home advertising displays  primarily on transit vehicles under transit district agreements and on outdoor advertising displays we own or operate 
revenues are a function of both the occupancy of these display spaces and the rates we can charge 
we focus our sales efforts on maximizing occupancy levels while maintaining rate integrity in our markets 
over the past several years  our transit advertising operations have expanded more rapidly than our outdoor advertising operations 
net revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million 
in fiscal the entire increase related to net transit revenues as outdoor net revenues were unchanged from fiscal to fiscal production and installation expenses 
these expenses relate primarily to the production of transit advertising content and the installation of the content on transit vehicles  benches and shelters 
also included is the cost of billboard content and installation 
production and installation expenses increased  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily related to increased production volume in transit related production 
transit and outdoor occupancy expenses 
these expenses include fees paid to transit authorities and lease payments to landowners for billboard sites 
under obie media s transit agreements  we typically guarantee to pay the transit district the greater of a minimum stated amount or a percentage of the advertising revenues generated by our use of the district s vehicles 
occupancy expense for outdoor structures includes the cost of illuminating outdoor displays and property taxes on the outdoor advertising structures 
transit and outdoor occupancy expenses decreased million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease is primarily as a result of renegotiated transit fee arrangements mentioned above 
selling expenses 
sales expenses consist primarily of employment and administrative expenses associated with our sales force 
these expenses increased  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily a result of a general inflationary increase in all expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include costs related to individual markets  as well as corporate expenses 
expenses related to individual markets include expenses for the personnel and facilities required to administer that market and neighboring markets 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent personnel and facilities costs for obie media s executive offices and centralized staff functions which include accounting  marketing  human resources and technology management 
general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was a combination of general inflationary increases in most expense items  offset by a reduction in bad debt expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and personnel reductions in marketing  human resources and the business office at the corporate headquarters 
start up costs 
start up costs are the costs obie incurs in pursuing new transit district agreements and the costs of establishing a sales force and office in a new market prior to beginning to operate under a new agreement 
these costs consist primarily of travel expenses  various personnel costs  legal fees and the costs of preparing proposals in response to transit district requests for proposals 
the amount of start up costs we incur in the future will vary  both in total amount and as a percentage of revenues  depending on the number and complexity of proposals for new districts and our success in obtaining new contracts 
there were no start up costs in either fiscal or fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to capital expenditures for outdoor advertising displays as well as investment in digital production equipment as noted above 
operating income 
due to the events and factors discussed above we experienced operating income of  in fiscal  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the amortization of the discount on the chicago transit authority settlement 
provision for income taxes 
the company accounted for all available loss carryback refunds in the fiscal provision for income taxes 
the company has substantial loss carryforwards  against which valuation allowances have been provided 
the net loss before income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of million for fiscal  the year in which carryback refunds were applied million of the benefit was applied to discontinued operations 
the difference between the statutory united states federal income tax rate and the beneficial tax rate for both fiscal and is due primarily to the deferred tax valuation reserve for the net operating loss carryforwards 
income loss from continuing operations 
due to the items and factors discussed above we experienced a loss of  in fiscal as compared to a loss of million in fiscal results of discontinued operations most transit arrangements include a provision that a certain percentage of net revenues be shared with the transit authorities transit fees on a revenue sharing basis a certain percentage to the transit authority  the balance retained by obie  but often with minimum payment requirements 
agreements that contain large minimum transit fee payment guarantees significantly hinder obie s ability to manage its operating expenses in weak economic environments 
these high minimum payment requirements have prompted the company to either negotiate modifications to those contracts  negotiate or effect early terminations to the contracts  or to exit the market at the end of the contract term 
as discussed above  discontinued operations contain the operating results  net of income taxes  for transit markets from which we have exited 
the discontinued operations for fiscal include the operations of san antonio  texas  cincinnati  ohio transit  and the ontario  canada markets described above 
discontinued operations for fiscal also included the results of operations  including the results of the settlement  related to the chicago  illinois market 
the results of the chicago operation and settlement included in fiscal is the primary reason for the million reduction in the loss from discontinued operations from fiscal to fiscal net loss obie realized a net loss of million during fiscal  compared to a net loss of million in fiscal the difference in the losses for fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to the decrease in the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal when compared to fiscal  and the absence of an income tax benefit for the operating loss in fiscal comparison of years ended november  and results of continuing operations revenues 
obie s revenues are derived from sales of advertising on out of home advertising displays  primarily on transit vehicles under transit district agreements and on outdoor advertising displays we own or operate 
revenues are a function of both the occupancy of these display spaces and the rates we can charge 
we focus our sales efforts on maximizing occupancy levels while maintaining rate integrity in our markets 
over the past several years  our transit advertising operations have expanded more rapidly than our outdoor advertising operations 
net revenues for fiscal decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was substantially the result of a general decline in national and local transit advertising  offset partially by increased revenues generated in the newly acquired markets of tampa and indianapolis 
net transit revenues decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to these same factors 
net outdoor advertising revenues increased approximately  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of revenues associated with price increases  improvements to existing billboards  and an acquisition of additional billboards in montana 
production and installation expenses 
these expenses relate primarily to the production of transit advertising content and the installation of the contact on transit vehicles  benches and shelters 
also included is the cost of billboard content and installation 
production and installation remained unchanged at million in both fiscal and transit and outdoor occupancy expenses 
these expenses include fees paid to transit authorities and lease payments to landowners for billboard sites 
under obie media s transit agreements  we typically guarantee to pay the transit district the greater of a minimum stated amount or a percentage of the advertising revenues generated by our use of the district s vehicles 
occupancy expense for outdoor structures includes the cost of illuminating outdoor displays and property taxes on the outdoor advertising structures 
these expenses decreased million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily a result of the reduction in percentage transit fee payments to transit authorities in light of the reduced transit revenues in fiscal selling expenses 
sales expenses consist primarily of employment and administrative expenses associated with our sales force 
these expenses increased million  or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was the result of higher than expected personnel turnover and related costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and the expansion of the overall sales force during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include costs related to individual markets  as well as corporate expenses 
expenses related to individual markets include expenses for the personnel and facilities required to administer that market and neighboring markets 
corporate general and administrative expenses represent personnel and facilities costs for obie media s executive offices and centralized staff functions 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from an increase of bad debt expenses of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and increases in personnel and related costs associated with managing the growth of obie s transit business  including the addition of new districts 
start up costs 
start up costs are the costs obie incurs in pursuing new transit district agreements and the costs of establishing a sales force and office in a new market prior to beginning to operate under a new agreement 
these costs consist primarily of travel expenses  various personnel costs  legal fees and the costs of preparing proposals in response to transit district requests for proposals 
the amount of start up costs we incur in the future will vary  both in total amount and as a percentage of revenues  depending on the number and complexity of proposals for new districts and our success in obtaining new contracts 
there were no start up costs for fiscal as compared to  in fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to capital expenditures for outdoor advertising displays and digital production equipment 
operating income 
due to the events and factors discussed above obie experienced an operating loss of million in fiscal  compared to operating income of million in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to the increased use of the working capital credit line and additional long term borrowings 
provision for income taxes 
the loss before income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of million for fiscal  compared to a provision for income taxes of million during fiscal million of the fiscal amount has been allocated to discontinued operations 
obie s beneficial tax rate was for fiscal the difference between the statutory united states federal income tax rate and the beneficial tax rate for fiscal is due primarily to a deferred tax valuation reserve for net operating loss carryforwards 
obie s effective tax rate for fiscal was  higher than the statutory rate due to provisions for foreign and state income taxes 
income loss from continuing operations 
due to the reasons and factors noted above  obie realized a net loss from continuing operations of million during fiscal  compared to net income of million in fiscal results of discontinued operations most transit arrangements include a provision that a certain percentage of net revenues be shared with the transit authorities transit fees on a revenue sharing basis a certain percentage to the transit authority  the balance retained by obie  but often with minimum payment requirements 
agreements that contain large minimum transit fee payment guarantees significantly hinder obie s ability to manage its operating expenses in weak economic environments 
these high minimum payment requirements have prompted the company to either negotiate modifications to those contracts  negotiate or effect early terminations to the contracts  or to exit the market at the end of the contract term 
as discussed above  discontinued operations contain the operating results  net of income taxes  for transit markets from which we have exited 
the discontinued operations for fiscal include the operations of san antonio  texas  cincinnati  ohio transit  and the ontario  canada markets described above 
discontinued operations for fiscal also included the results of operations  including the results of the settlement  related to the chicago  illinois market 
there were no results from discontinued operations to report in fiscal net loss due to the reasons and factors noted above  obie realized a net loss of million during fiscal  compared to net income of million in fiscal recent developments a substantial portion of obie s loss for fiscal resulted from the payment of minimum advertising revenues guaranteed to transit districts under our transit district contracts 
beginning in the latter half of fiscal we began to be increasingly concerned about these minimum revenue guarantees in the face of declining advertising revenues in some transportation districts 
accordingly  we began to seek to restructure or terminate certain of these arrangements in a way that would limit obie s exposure to these payments to an amount that would reflect a more appropriate sharing of revenues under our advertising contracts 
between august  and february   we have renegotiated contracts that have resulted in transit guarantee reductions of million in fiscal and million in fiscal it cannot be assured that we will be able to eliminate or further reduce this type of risk and  if not  we may experience further adverse impacts on our operating revenues  some or all of which may be material 
in addition  during fiscal  transit contract bids occurred in our transit markets of austin  dallas and san antonio  texas  kansas city  cincinnati buses and santa cruz and sacramento  california 
we were awarded new contracts in kansas city  dallas and sacramento 
contracts for the other markets were awarded to competitors  except for santa cruz where a decision by the transit authority is still pending 
the results of operations of those markets where we were not the successful bidder have been included in the results of discontinued operations in our statement of operations 
on december  the company received notice from the chicago transit authority cta that it was terminating the company s transit advertising agreement effective as of that date 
the company and the cta had been disputing settlement of transit fees in light of the nature of the early termination and a shortage of advertising space made available to the company  and the parties entered into an agreement as of may  resolving all of the outstanding issues 
the agreed upon fee for the contract year has been settled with the cta at million  substantially less than the original contracted guaranteed payment of million 
as of may   approximately million had been paid to the cta  and an additional million was paid on june  the balance is payable in substantially equal monthly payments of  beginning june and ending may  with an additional million balloon payment due in january the monthly payments are without interest through may  and include a interest charge thereafter 
these periodic deferred payments have been valued using a junior unsecured discount rate of  resulting in a present value of million  which is included within long term debt in our balance sheet 
the result is a present value of for the settlement 
the cost of the settlement is covered by previous accruals  including an accrual which the company established in the third quarter of fiscal effective february  obie entered into a new financing arrangement with us bank 
the arrangement provided for a million term line maturing in august of  and a million working capital line of credit available for general purposes 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of obie and its subsidiaries 
obie used the term revolver to refinance all of its then existing debt  including the previously outstanding line of credit 
principal payments on the term revolver began in the third quarter of fiscal as of november  we were not in compliance with our operating covenants in our existing credit facility that relate to certain financial ratios  and us bank has granted us a waiver of that non compliance 
on february  us bank and obie agreed to a revised credit facility which included a reduction in the working capital line of credit to million  modified financial ratio covenants  and reduced principal payment requirements during fiscal million was available under the working capital line of credit as of november  the revised agreement extends the term of the credit facility through december  when both the term revolver and working capital credit line expire 
the credit facility requires the execution and delivery of definitive transaction documentation and obie s continued compliance with the revised covenants 
effective december  we formed a new wholly owned subsidiary  select media  inc under which our national sales organization will operate 
seasonality historically  obie media s revenues and operating results have fluctuated by season 
typically  obie s results of operations are strongest in the fourth quarter and weakest in the first quarter of our fiscal year  which ends november obie s transit advertising operations are more seasonal than our outdoor advertising operations as the outdoor advertising display space  unlike our transit advertising display space  is and has been sold nearly exclusively by means of month contracts 
management believes the seasonality of our revenues and operating results will increase if transit advertising operations continue to expand more rapidly than our outdoor advertising operations 
this seasonality  together with fluctuations in general and regional economic conditions and the timing and expenses related to acquisitions  securing new transit agreements and other actions we have taken and plan to continue to take to implement our growth strategy  have contributed to fluctuations in our periodic operating results 
these fluctuations likely will continue 
accordingly  results of operations in any period may not be indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
liquidity and capital resources obie media has historically satisfied its working capital requirements with cash from operations and revolving credit borrowings 
obie s working capital at november  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital is due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable  due primarily to the exit from the chicago market  a reduction in accrued transit fees because of the amount included in that related to the chicago settlement that has been recorded as long term debt in in accordance with the settlement agreement  increased utilization of the company s working capital line of credit  and an increase in the current portion of long term debt 
acquisitions and capital expenditures  primarily for the construction of new outdoor advertising displays  digital printing equipment and technology related assets  have been financed primarily with borrowed funds 
obie media s net cash provided by operating activities was million during fiscal as compared to net cash used in operating activities of in fiscal the change between periods was due primarily to a decrease in accounts receivable and refundable income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal resulted primarily from a reduction of  in capital expenditures in fiscal when compared to fiscal  offset by the cost of acquiring the minority interest in ob walls  inc capital expenditures consist primarily of the cost of building and acquiring outdoor advertising displays and the cost of digital printing equipment in both years 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures will approximate  in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of a million increase in payments on long term debt in fiscal as compared to fiscal effective february  obie entered into a new financing arrangement with us bank 
the arrangement provided for a million term line maturing in august of  and a million working capital line of credit available for general purposes 
these credit facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of obie and its subsidiaries 
obie used the term revolver to refinance all of its then existing debt  including the previously outstanding line of credit 
principal payments on the term revolver began in the third quarter of fiscal as of november  we were not in compliance with our operating covenants in our existing credit facility that relate to certain financial ratios  and us bank has granted us a waiver of that non compliance 
on february th  us bank and obie agreed to a revised credit facility which included a reduction in the working capital line of credit to million  modified financial ratio covenants and a reduction of principal payment requirements for fiscal million was available under the working capital line of credit as of november  the revised agreement extends the term of the credit facility through december  when both the term revolver and working capital credit line expire 
the credit facility requires the execution and delivery of definitive transaction documentation and obie s continued compliance with the revised covenants 
management can provide no assurances that us bank will continue to renew our credit arrangements as they expire 
see recent developments above 
at november  obie media had outstanding borrowings of million  of which million was pursuant to the credit agreements with us bank described above  million pursuant to the chicago transit authority settlement   for the acquisition of the minority interest in ob walls  inc  and  pursuant to the agreement to acquire p c 
we expect to continue pursuing a policy of measured growth through obtaining new transit district agreements  acquiring out of home advertising companies or assets and constructing new outdoor advertising displays 
we intend to finance our future expansion activities using a combination of internal and external sources 
management believes that internally generated funds and funds available for borrowing under obie s bank credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy all debt service obligations  to finance existing operations  including anticipated capital expenditures but excluding possible acquisitions  through fiscal future acquisitions by obie media  if any  may require additional debt or equity financing 
long term financial obligations and other commercial commitments our significant long term contractual obligations as of november  are as follows cash payments during the fiscal years ended november in thousands description of commitment thereafter transit guaranteed minimum      payments chicago transit authority settlement     building and land leases bank term loan   market risk because our debt bears interest at variable rates  we may be exposed to future interest rate changes on our debt

sfas is an amendment to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas and establish accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments 
sfas and are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  obie adopted sfas and for its fiscal year beginning december  obie does not currently have any derivative instruments nor does it participate in hedging activities  and therefore the adoption of these standards did not have any impact on its financial statements or results of operations 
on june   the fasb issued sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite economic useful lives 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  obie adopted sfas effective december  as of november  obie had net unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested annually for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and  in transition  this step must be measured as of the beginning of the fiscal year 
however  a company has six months from the date of adoption to complete this first step 
obie expects to complete that first step of the goodwill impairment testing during the first quarter of the year ending november  fiscal year 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of impairment loss measured as of the beginning of the year of adoption  if any  and must be completed by the end of the company s fiscal year 
any impairment loss resulting from the transitional impairment tests will be reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal year the company does not believe that the effect of these impairment tests will have a material effect on the company s earnings and financial position
