item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company was organized in to address market opportunities in the area of biological implantable products and materials and today is a leader in preservation of human tissues for cardiovascular and vascular transplant applications 
the company was a leader in orthopaedic transplant applications until it suspended processing orthopaedic tissue from august following the receipt of the fda order until late february additionally  the company develops and commercializes implantable medical devices  including bioglue surgical adhesive  synergraft processed bovine vascular grafts  and glutaraldehyde fixed stentless porcine heart valves 
the company s revenues are primarily generated in the us in   and  approximately   and  respectively  of total revenues were derived from international sources 
prior to december the company sold bioglue surgical adhesive in the us as an adjunct in the repair of acute thoracic aortic dissections pursuant to an hde 
in december the company received fda approval for the use of bioglue in the us as an adjunct to sutures and staples in open surgical repair of large vessels for adult patients 
as a result  the number of annual procedures in the us in which bioglue could be potentially used increased from approximately  procedures to in excess of  procedures 
due to this approval  the composition of the company s revenues is expected to change in future years with the anticipated growth in shipments of bioglue surgical adhesive 
critical accounting policies a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the consistent application of these policies enables the company to provide users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the following are accounting policies that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
deferred preservation costs tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ and tissue procurement agencies  which consign the tissue to the company for processing and preservation 
preservation costs related to tissue held by the company are deferred until revenue is recognized upon shipment of the tissue to the implanting facilities 
deferred preservation costs consist primarily of laboratory expenses  tissue procurement fees  fringe benefits  facility allocations  and freight in charges  and are stated  net of reserve  on a first in  first out basis 
as of december  the deferred preservation costs were million for allograft heart valve tissues   for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and zero for orthopaedic tissues 
during the company recorded a write down of deferred preservation costs of million for valved cardiac tissues  million for non valved cardiac tissues  million for vascular tissues  and million for orthopaedic tissue totaling million 
these write downs were recorded as a result of the fda order as discussed at item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation 
the amount of these write downs reflects management s estimate based on information currently available to it 
these estimates may prove inaccurate  as the scope and impact of the fda order are determined 
management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of these deferred preservation costs based on the factors discussed in the recent events section and record additional write downs if it becomes clear that additional impairments have occurred 
the write down creates a new cost basis which cannot be written back up if these tissues become saleable 
the cost of human tissue preservation services may be favorably impacted depending on the future level of tissue shipments related to previously written down deferred preservation costs 
the shipment levels of these written down tissues will be affected by the amount and timing of the release of tissues processed after september   as a result of the agreement with the fda  since  under the agreement  written down tissues may be shipped if tissues processed after september  are not available for shipment 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses the impairment of its long lived  identifiable intangible assets and related goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that management considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and o significant decline in the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires the write down of a long lived asset to be held and used if the carrying value of the asset or the asset group to which the asset belongs is not recoverable 
the carrying value of the asset or asset group is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group 
as of september   in applying sfas  the company determined that the asset groups consisted of the long lived assets related to the company s two reporting segments  as these asset groups represent the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
the company used a fourteen year period for the undiscounted future cash flows 
this period of time was selected based upon the remaining life of the primary assets of the asset groups  which are leasehold improvements 
the undiscounted future cash flows related to these asset groups exceeded their carrying values as of september  and december  and therefore management has concluded that there is not an impairment of the company s long lived intangible assets  except for goodwill discussed below  and tangible assets related to the tissue preservation business or medical device business 
however  depending on the company s ability to rebuild demand for its tissue preservation services  the outcome of discussions with the fda regarding the shipping of orthopaedic tissues  and the future effects of adverse publicity surrounding the fda order and reported infections on preservation revenues  these assets may become impaired 
management will continue to evaluate the recoverability of these assets in accordance with sfas beginning with the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january  the goodwill resulting from business acquisitions is not amortized  but is instead subject to periodic impairment testing in accordance with sfas patent costs are amortized over the expected useful lives of the patents primarily years using the straight line method 
other intangibles  which consist primarily of manufacturing rights and agreements  are amortized over the expected useful lives of the related assets primarily five years 
as a result of the fda order  the company determined that an evaluation of the possible impairment of intangible assets under sfas was necessary 
the company engaged an independent valuation expert to perform the valuation using a discounted cash flow methodology  and as a result of this analysis  the company determined that goodwill related to its tissue processing reporting unit was fully impaired as of september  therefore  the company recorded a write down of million in goodwill during the quarter ended september  management does not believe an impairment exists related to the other intangible assets that were assessed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
product liability claims in the normal course of business as a medical device and services company the company has product liability complaints filed against it 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to unreported product liability claims  and records accruals as necessary for the estimated cost of unreported claims related to services performed and products sold 
as of december  the company accrued million in estimated costs for unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  the company engaged an independent actuarial firm to perform an analysis of the unreported product claims as of december  the unreported product loss liability was estimated using a frequency severity approach  whereas  projected losses were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims were calculated based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim emergence and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim was calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the expense was recorded in general  administrative  and marketing expenses and was included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
new accounting pronouncements the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas on january  sfas addresses accounting and reporting for retirement costs of long lived assets resulting from legal obligations associated with acquisition  construction  or development transactions 
the company has determined that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company  as the company does not currently have any relevant transactions 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements  and  amendment to fasb statement  and technical corrections sfas on january  sfas rescinds sfas no 
  and  which required gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be classified as extraordinary items 
sfas also amends sfas no 
eliminating inconsistencies in certain sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  the company has determined that the adoption of sfas will not have a material effect on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company  as the company does not currently have any relevant transactions 
the company will be required to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas on january  sfas requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recorded at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
the company will adopt sfas for restructuring plans entered into after december results of operations amounts in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues three months ended twelve months ended december  december  revenues as reported     reduction in revenues due to estimated tissue recall returns  revenues prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns     revenues prior to the reduction for the estimated effect of tissue returns as a result of the fda order decreased and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended december  this decrease in revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively  was primarily due to a and decrease in human tissue preservation service revenues as a result of the fda order s restriction on shipments of certain tissues  the company s management has included this information to show the revenue effect of tissue returns resulting from the recall instituted by the fda order 
cessation of orthopaedic processing  and decreased demand as a result of the adverse publicity surrounding the fda order  partially offset by an and increase in bioglue r surgical adhesive revenues for the three and twelve months ended december   respectively 
the bioglue increases were primarily attributable to the receipt of fda approval in december for the use of bioglue in the us as an adjunct to sutures and staples in open surgical repair of large vessels for adult patients 
revenues as reported decreased for the twelve months ended december  revenues were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of million in preservation service revenues during the twelve months ended december  as discussed below  the estimated amount of recall returns includes credits for tissues actually returned to the company to date and the expected credits for future tissues to be returned to the company as a result of the fda order 
no adjustments have been made to the original estimate of recall returns as actual returns to date have approximated the original estimate of recall returns 
the company expects the final recall returns to be received in the first quarter of  at which time the estimate may change depending on final actual recall returns 
management believes that a decrease in revenues as compared to prior periods will continue at least through the first half of  although  the close out of the april fda should assist the company in rebuilding demand for its preservation services 
in the event the company is not successful in rebuilding demand for its preservation services  future revenues can be expected to decrease significantly as compared to prior year periods 
as discussed at item  business recent events  the outcome of the discussions with the fda regarding the use of the synergraft process on human tissue could result in a reduction in synergraft processed cardiovascular and vascular tissue which would reduce revenue and the gross margins with respect to cardiovascular and vascular tissues 
bioglue surgical adhesive three months ended twelve months ended december  december  revenues as reported     percentage of total revenue as reported percentage of total revenue prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns revenues from the sale of bioglue surgical adhesive increased and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended december  the increase in revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was due to an increase in the milliliters of bioglue shipped of and  respectively  and a and  respectively  increase in the average selling price of the bioglue shipped 
the increase in shipments was primarily due to the receipt of fda approval in december for the use of bioglue in the us as an adjunct to sutures and staples in open surgical repair of large vessels for adult patients 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues for the three months ended december  and  respectively 
domestic revenues accounted for and of total bioglue revenues for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
although bioglue revenue increased as compared to the prior year and bioglue was not included in the fda order  future sales of bioglue could be adversely affected due to the adverse publicity surrounding the fda s review of and correspondence with the company 
additionally  there is a possibility the company s bioglue manufacturing operations could come under increased scrutiny from the fda as a result of their review of the company s tissue processing laboratories 
cardiovascular preservation services three months ended twelve months ended december  december  revenues as reported     percentage of total revenue as reported revenues prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns     percentage of total revenue prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns revenues from cardiovascular preservation services prior to the reduction for estimated returns of tissue subject to the fda order decreased and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended december  this decrease in revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was primarily due to a decline in customer demand due to the adverse publicity surrounding the fda order  the fda letter posted on its website  certain reported tissue infections and the related adverse publicity  and the restrictions on shipments of certain tissues subject to the fda order 
revenues as reported from cardiovascular preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  in addition to the factors discussed above  the revenues as reported from cardiovascular preservation services were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the non valved cardiac tissues returned subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of  in service revenues during the twelve months ended december the company anticipates a future decrease in cardiovascular preservation revenues as compared to prior year periods for at least the first half of as a result of the fda warning letter  the fda order  the fda letter posted on its website  certain reported tissue infections  and the related adverse publicity 
the company anticipates that the clarification received from the fda on december  that non valve conduit tissues processed after september  are not subject to the fda order and that the company is able to ship these tissues without obtaining physician prescriptions  labeling the tissue as subject to a recall  or requiring special steps regarding procurement agency records of donor screening and testing beyond those required for all processors of human tissue will enable the company to increase its shipments of non valve conduit tissue as compared to the fourth quarter of if the company is unable to rebuild demand for its preservation services for these tissues  future non valved cardiac preservation revenue could continue to decrease 
the clarification from the fda does not affect heart valve tissues  as these tissues are not subject to the fda order 
vascular preservation services three months ended twelve months ended december  december  revenues as reported     percentage of total revenues as reported revenues prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns     percentage of total revenue prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns revenues from human vascular tissue preservation services prior to reduction for estimated returns of tissue subject to the fda order decreased and  respectively  for the three and twelve months ended december  this decrease in revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was primarily due to a decline in customer demand due to the adverse publicity surrounding the fda order  certain reported tissue infections  and the restrictions on shipments of certain tissues subject to the fda order 
revenues as reported from human vascular tissue preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  in addition to the factors discussed above  the revenues as reported from vascular tissue preservation services were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of million in vascular preservation service revenues during the twelve months ended december  the company anticipates a future decrease in vascular preservation revenues as compared to prior year periods for at least the first half of as a result of the adverse publicity surrounding the fda warning letter  fda order  and certain reported tissue infections 
the company anticipates that the clarification received from the fda on december  that vascular tissues processed after september  are not subject to the fda order and that the company is able to ship these tissues without obtaining physician prescriptions  labeling the tissue as subject to a recall  or requiring special steps regarding procurement agency records of donor screening and testing beyond those required for all processors of human tissue will enable the company to increase its shipments of vascular tissue as compared to the fourth quarter of if the company is unable to rebuild demand for its preservation services for these tissues  future vascular preservation revenue could continue to decrease 
orthopaedic preservation services three months ended twelve months ended december  december  revenues as reported    percentage of total revenue as reported revenues prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns    percentage of total revenue prior to reduction for estimated tissue recall returns revenues from human orthopaedic tissue preservation services prior to reduction for estimated returns of tissue subject to the fda order decreased and for the three and twelve months ended december  this decrease in revenues for the three and twelve month periods ended december  was primarily due to a decline in customer demand due to the adverse publicity surrounding the fda order  certain reported tissue infections  cessation of processing of orthopaedic tissue  and the restrictions on shipments of tissues subject to the fda order 
revenues since august  have been from shipments of orthopaedic tissues that were processed prior to october  revenues as reported from human orthopaedic tissue preservation services decreased for the twelve months ended december  in addition to the factors discussed above  the revenues as reported from orthopaedic tissue preservation services were adversely impacted by the estimated effect of the return of tissues subject to recall by the fda order  which resulted in an estimated decrease of  in orthopaedic preservation service revenues during the twelve months ended december  the company anticipates a substantial decrease in the orthopaedic preservation revenues as compared to prior year periods for at least the first half of due to the company s inability to ship orthopaedic grafts processed between october  and september  pursuant to the fda order  the adverse publicity resulting from the fda warning letter and fda order  and the reported infections in some orthopaedic allograft recipients 
the company resumed processing orthopaedic tissues in late february following the close out of the april fda as discussed in item business fda order on human tissue preservation services 
if the company is unable to rebuild demand for its preservation services for orthopaedic tissues or if it is unable to confirm that the fda does not disagree with the company s interpretation that following the close out of the april fda the company can resume distribution of orthopaedic tissue  future orthopaedic preservation revenue  if any  may be minimal 
bioprosthetic devices revenues from bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices increased to  in from  in  representing of total revenues during such periods 
this increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in the demand for the company s synergraft bovine vascular grafts which received ce mark approval in august distribution and grant revenues grant revenues decreased to  in from  in grant revenues in both years were primarily attributable to the synergraft research and development programs 
distribution revenues increased to  in from  in distribution revenues are for commissions received for the distribution of orthopaedic tissues for another processor 
costs and expenses cost of human tissue preservation services aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total human tissue preservation service revenues during each period 
cost of human tissue preservation services aggregated million in fourth quarter of compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total human tissue preservation service revenues during each period 
the increase in the full year cost of preservation was due to the million write down of deferred preservation costs recorded in the second and third quarters of related to the fda order see item business 
fda order on human tissue preservation 
the decrease in the fourth quarter cost of preservation was due to decreased demand and shipments of tissue for which approximately million of deferred preservation costs that were written off in the second and third quarter of the company anticipates a reduction in the cost of human tissue preservation services due to a reduction in shipments of tissues as a result of the fda order  however  the cost of human tissue preservation services as a percent of revenue is likely to increase as a result of lower tissue processing volumes  especially if the decline in demand continues 
additionally  the cost of human tissue preservation services may be favorably impacted  depending on the future level of tissue shipments related to previously written down deferred preservation costs  because the write down creates a new cost basis which cannot be written back up if these tissues become saleable 
the shipment levels of these written down tissues will be affected by the amount and timing of the release of tissues processed after september   pursuant to the agreement with the fda  since written down tissues may be shipped if tissues processed after the agreement are not available for shipment cost of products aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total product revenues during such periods 
cost of products aggregated million in the fourth quarter of compared to million in the fourth quarter of  representing and  respectively  of total product revenues during such periods 
the cost of products includes a million write down of bioprosthetic valves  including synergraft and non synergraft treated porcine valves  in the third quarter of due to the company s decision to stop future expenditures on the development and marketing of these valves and to maintain its focus on its preservation services business  and its bioglue and synergraft vascular graft product lines 
the decrease in the fourth quarter cost of products as a percentage of total product revenues is due to a favorable product mix that was impacted by the increase in revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive  which carries higher gross margins than bioprosthetic devices 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in expenditures for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increased overhead costs in connection with the expansion of the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  which was substantially completed in the first quarter of  a million accrual for estimated product loss claims that have been incurred but not reported as of december   an increase of million in insurance premiums  an increase of million in legal and accounting costs due to the response to the fda order and increased litigation  a million accrual for retention levels under the company s liability and directors and officers insurance policies see legal proceedings at part i  item  additional professional fees of million required to address the observations detailed in the warning letter and severance and related costs of approximately  due to the reduction in employee force of approximately employees 
the company expects to continue to incur significant legal costs and professional fees to defend the lawsuits filed against the company and to address fda compliance requirements 
additional marketing expenses may also be incurred to address the effects of the adverse publicity surrounding the fda order research and development expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
research and development spending in was primarily focused on the company s synergraft and protein hydrogel technologies 
as discussed in new accounting pronouncements  the company recorded a million write down of its goodwill  which is shown as a separate line on the consolidated income statements for the twelve months ended december  interest income  net of interest expense  was  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in net interest income was due to reduced interest rates in as compared to  a reduction in the principal debt amount outstanding due to scheduled payments  and the lack of interest expense capitalized in in connection with the expansion of the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility  which was substantially completed in the first quarter of the effective income tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million in from million in the increase in revenues was primarily due to increased sales of bioglue surgical adhesive and growth in the company s human vascular and orthopaedic tissue preservation services 
the increases were primarily attributable to a greater acceptance of these products by the surgical community and the company s ability to procure greater amounts of tissue 
these increases in revenues have been offset by decreases in other revenues 
year over year statistics presented for tissues procured and processed for human tissue preservation services are from the period beginning in november of the prior year through october of the current year  as such procurement and processing of tissues received during this time period is the primary generator of calendar year revenues 
bioglue surgical adhesive twelve months ended december  revenues   percentage of total revenue revenues from the sale of bioglue surgical adhesive increased for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was due to a increase in the number of milliliter shipments of bioglue 
the increase in shipments was primarily due to increased acceptance of bioglue since its introduction in domestic markets in january of pursuant to a hde and its introduction in international markets in april additionally  bioglue shipments increased in as a result of subsequent domestic and international regulatory approvals for use of bioglue for certain indications 
domestic revenues were and of total bioglue revenues in and  respectively 
cardiovascular preservation services twelve months ended december  revenues   percentage of total revenue revenues from cardiovascular preservation services decreased for the year ended december  this decrease in revenues resulted from a decrease in the number of cardiovascular allograft shipments as a result of a decrease in cardiovascular tissues procured and processed year over year 
although cardiovascular tissues procured and processed decreased year over year  cardiovascular tissues procured and processed improved during the course of resulting in a increase in cardiovascular tissue processed during the fourth quarter of as compared to fourth quarter of vascular preservation services twelve months ended december  revenues   percentage of total revenue revenues from human vascular tissue preservation services increased for the year ended december  this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of vascular allograft shipments resulting from an increase in vascular tissues procured and processed year over year and an increase in demand for all vascular tissue types 
orthopaedic preservation services twelve months ended december  revenues   percentage of total revenue revenues from human orthopaedic tissue preservation services increased for the year ended december  this increase in revenues was primarily due to a increase in the number of allograft shipments 
the increase in orthopaedic shipments  primarily osteochondral grafts and non bone tendons  was due to a increase in orthopaedic allograft tissues procured and processed year over year and an increasing acceptance of these tissues in the orthopaedic surgeon community 
shipments of non bone tendons and osteochondral grafts increased and  respectively  in resulting in a million and million increase  respectively  in revenues in as compared to additional increases in revenues were due to a more favorable product mix  with increased shipments of osteochondral grafts  which carry higher average selling prices than other orthopaedic tissues 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in boned tendon shipments resulting in a  decrease in revenues in as compared to bioprosthetic devices revenues from bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices decreased to  in from  in  representing of total revenues during such periods 
this decrease in revenues was primarily due to the company s on going focus on development and start up of production of the company s synergraft line of bioprosthetic heart valves and vascular grafts which adversely impacted its ability to manufacture other bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices during the first half of single use medical devices revenues from single use medical devices manufactured by the company s former wholly owned subsidiary ideas for medicine  inc ifm decreased to zero in from million in the decrease in revenues was due to the october  sale of substantially all of the remaining assets of ifm to horizon medical products  inc hmp 
see further discussion of the sale of the ifm assets in note to the consolidated financial statements 
distribution and grant revenues grant revenues increased to  in from  in grant revenues in both years are primarily attributable to the synergraft research and development programs 
costs and expenses cost of human tissue preservation services aggregated million in compared to million in  representing of total human tissue preservation service revenues during each period 
cost of products aggregated million in compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total product revenues during such periods 
the decrease in the cost of products as a percentage of total product revenues was due to a more favorable product mix during the product mix was impacted by an increase in revenues from bioglue surgical adhesive  which carries higher gross margins than bioprosthetic devices  and the termination of the ifm oem contract with hmp  which had significantly lower margins than bioglue surgical adhesive 
general  administrative  and marketing expenses increased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
the increase in expenditures in was primarily due to an increase of  resulting from a full year of operations of cryolife europa  ltd  the company s european headquarters established in early  an increase in marketing and general expenses to support revenue growth  and  of non recurring charges 
the non recurring charges consist primarily of  associated with the termination of certain international distributor agreements and  of costs previously capitalized in connection with uncompleted licensing transactions 
research and development expenses decreased to million in  compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total revenues during such periods 
research and development spending in related principally to the company s human clinical trials for its bioglue surgical adhesive and to its focus on its synergraft and protein hydrogel technologies 
total research and development expenses decreased in due to the wrap up of the bioglue clinical trial and the lack of active enrollment expenses from this trial in as compared to interest income  net of interest expense  was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in net interest income and expense was due primarily to the interest expense capitalized in in connection with the expansion of the corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility 
other expense was  in as compared to other income of  in other expense in primarily consisted of a million loss related to an other than temporary decline in the market value of marketable securities previously recorded in comprehensive income as a component of shareholder s equity  partially offset by a non recurring gain of  related to the reversal of the previously established reserve against the note receivable from the sale of the ifm assets and product line 
the effective income tax rate was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
seasonality the demand for the company s cardiovascular tissue preservation services is seasonal  with peak demand generally occurring in the second and third quarters 
management believes this trend for cardiovascular tissue preservation services is primarily due to the high number of surgeries scheduled during the summer months when younger patients are out of school for the summer break and also due to a greater availability of tissue as donation is often higher in the summer months 
however  the demand for the company s human vascular and orthopaedic tissue preservation services  bioglue surgical adhesive  and bioprosthetic cardiovascular and vascular devices does not appear to experience seasonal trends 
liquidity and capital resources at december  net working capital current assets less current liabilities was million  with a current ratio current assets divided by current liabilities of to  compared to million at december  the company s primary capital requirements historically arose out of general working capital needs  capital expenditures for facilities and equipment  and funding of research and development projects 
the company funded these requirements through cash generated by operations  equity offerings  and bank credit facilities 
based on the decrease in revenues resulting from the fda order and associated adverse publicity  the company expects that its cash generated by operations will decrease significantly over the near term  and that net working capital will decrease 
it is possible that the company will not have sufficient funds to meet its primary capital requirements over the long term 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  as compared to cash provided of million in the million of cash used in was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements  which resulted in a million decrease in cash  partially offset by million in net income before depreciation  taxes  and excluding non cash items 
working capital needs were largely driven by a million increase in deferred preservation costs  excluding the effect of the non cash write down 
non cash adjustments to net income for include a million write down for the impairment of deferred preservation costs resulting from the fda order as discussed in recent events  a million write down for the impairment of inventory as discussed in costs and expenses  and a million write down of goodwill as discussed in critical accounting policies 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for  as compared to cash used of million for the million in current year cash provided was primarily due to a net million increase in cash from sales and maturities of marketable securities  primarily due to the maturity of debt securities  and million in proceeds from notes receivable  partially offset by a million decrease due to capital expenditures in  as the expansion and renovation of the company s corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities approached completion  and a decrease due to spending on patents of million  primarily relating to costs incurred to defend the synergraft technology patents 
net cash used in financing activities was million for  as compared to cash provided of million for the million in cash used in was primarily due to million in principal payments on the term loan   for the purchase of treasury stock  and  in principal payments on capital leases  offset by a million increase due to proceeds from stock option exercises 
scheduled contractual obligations and the related future payments are as follows in thousands total thereafter debt     capital lease obligations   operating leases      purchase commitments total contractual obligations      on march  the million convertible debenture due on march  was converted into approximately  shares of common stock at per common share 
the company s term loan  of which the principal balance was million as of february   contains certain restrictive covenants including  but not limited to  maintenance of certain financial ratios and a minimum tangible net worth requirement  and the requirement that no materially adverse event has occurred 
the lender has determined that the fda order  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and the inquiries of the securities and exchange commission  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  have a material adverse effect on the company that constitutes an event of default 
additionally  as of december   the company is in violation of the debt coverage ratio and net worth financial covenants 
as of february  the lender has elected not to declare an event of default  but reserves the right to exercise any such right under the terms of the term loan 
therefore  all amounts due under the term loan as of december  are reflected as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
in the event the lender calls the term loan  the company at present has adequate funds to pay the principal amount outstanding 
the term loan is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
due to cross default provisions included in the company s debt agreements  as of december  the company was in default of certain capital lease agreements maintained with the lender of the term loan 
therefore  all amounts due under these capital leases are reflected as a current liability on the consolidated balance sheets as of december  the company s term loan  which accrues interest computed at adjusted libor plus  exposes the company to changes in interest rates going forward 
on march   the company entered into a million notional amount forward starting interest swap agreement  which took effect on june  and expires in this swap agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge to effectively convert a portion of the term loan balance to a fixed rate basis  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
this agreement involves the receipt of floating rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate interest payments over the life of the agreement  without an exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
the differential to be paid or received is recognized in the period in which it accrues as an adjustment to interest expense on the term loan 
on january  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas as amended 
sfas requires the company to recognize all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value  and changes in the derivative s fair value must be recognized currently in earnings or other comprehensive income  as applicable 
the adoption of sfas impacts the accounting for the company s forward starting interest rate swap agreement
