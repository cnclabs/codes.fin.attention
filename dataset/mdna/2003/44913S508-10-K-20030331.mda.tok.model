the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for services or debtors to satisfy note receivable obligations 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers or debtors deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of intangible assets and software development costs we assess the impairment of intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company assesses the recoverability of its software development costs against estimated future revenue over the estimated remaining economic life of the software

in october  we restructured our operations to reposition for long term growth and to remain competitive in meeting the changing needs of our customers 
as part of the restructuring  we eliminated positions  representing of our workforce  and streamlined operations with reductions in the following departments operations  customer and technical support  sales  administration  and product and market development 
we also ceased development and marketing of our marketscreen product  but will continue to service customers using the product 
in addition  we eliminated certain facilities 
we believe that these steps will result in a reduction in annual expense of approximately to million 
on march   hyperfeed announced a planned private placement of  from its executive officers  individual board members and its largest investor  pico holdings  inc  whose officers are also hyperfeed board members

effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which applies to legal obligations that are associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
sfas requires that an asset retirement liability be recorded at fair value when an enterprise incurs the legal obligation to retire a long lived asset 
the enterprise also would record the carrying amount of the related long lived asset and depreciate that asset over its useful life 
in subsequent periods  the asset retirement liability would be adjusted to reflect the passage of time and changes in the undiscounted estimates of cash flows that were associated with the initial measurement 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
management is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements and does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  or other exit or disposal activity 
this standard will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 

this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
management is currently evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables the issue 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into for fiscal years beginning after june  the issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  the issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one earnings process and  if it does  how to divide the arrangement into separate units of accounting consistent with the identified earnings processes for revenue recognition purposes 
the issue also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
management is currently reviewing the impact that eitf will have on the company s future results of operations  but upon our initial review the company does not believe the issue will have a significant impact on its accounting for multiple element arrangements 
other we do not believe general inflation materially impacts our sales and operating results 
we do not expect that current tax legislation will significantly affect our future financial position  liquidity or operating results 
at december   the company had federal income tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes and approximately  for the alternative minimum tax 
approximately  of these net operating losses relates to exercise of incentive employee stock options and will be credited directly to stockholders equity when realized 
the company also had research and development credits of  that will all expire by if not previously utilized 
the future utilization of these net operating losses and research and development credits will be limited due to changes in company ownership 
the net operating loss carryforwards expire through the company has not recorded any tax benefits related to these net operating loss carryforwards 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results you should read the following factors in conjunction with the factors discussed elsewhere in this and our other filings with the sec and in materials incorporated by reference in these filings 
the following is intended to highlight certain factors that may affect the financial condition and results of operations of hyperfeed and are not meant to be an exhaustive discussion of risks that apply to hyperfeed 
like other businesses  hyperfeed is susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states or abroad  as were experienced in fiscal year  and continues into fiscal year  that may affect the general economic climate and performance of hyperfeed or its customers 
hyperfeed has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant period to period fluctuations in its revenues and operating results  which may result in volatility in the price of its stock 
hyperfeed s quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future 
accordingly  you should not rely on period to period comparisons as an indication of future performance 
in addition  these variations may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
if quarterly results fail to meet public expectations  the price of our stock may decline 
hyperfeed s revenues and operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors  including factors that generally affect everyone in its industry and factors that are more specific to its business and products 
the principal risk we face in our business include the following our ability to fund our current and future business strategies either through continuing operations or external financing  our ability to successfully compete against competitive products and services  our ability to maintain our existing customer base while increasing the company s presence in the financial institutional marketplace  the loss or gain of important customers  our ability to maintain relationships with key suppliers and providers of market data  our ability to successfully attract  retain and integrate qualified management and key employees  our ability to develop and introduce new products and services in a timely manner and at competitive price and performance levels  the timing of the development and introduction of new products or enhanced versions of existing products  market acceptance of new products  increased competition  and competitive pricing pressure  our ability to anticipate evolving trends in the industry and changing customer product requirements  the competitiveness of our customers  risks related to pending or future legal proceedings  and acts of terrorism and international conflicts 
the above factors have affected our business in the past and may affect us in the future 
hyperfeed has a recent history of operating losses and may not become or remain profitable 
hyperfeed has sustained significant losses in recent years and may not become profitable in the future 
if we incur additional losses or fail to achieve profitability in the future  this will hinder our ability to operate our current business and may affect the trading price of our common stock 
we incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended december  and a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
these conditions raise doubt about our ability to operate profitably in the future 
we may require additional financing to continue to operate our business that may not be readily available or available on favorable terms to us 
in order to remain competitive  hyperfeed must continue to make investments in research and development and capital equipment 
we believe that existing liquid resources and funds generated from operations  if any  combined with the ability to borrow funds will be adequate to meet our operating and capital requirements and obligations into the foreseeable future 
we may  from time to time  seek additional equity or debt financing 
however  those funds  when needed  might not be available on terms that we find acceptable 
any future equity financing will also lead to dilution to existing shareholders 
we have explored  and continue to explore  multiple alternatives that may be available for the purpose of enhancing stockholder value 
these alternatives may include a merger  a spin off or sale of part or all of our business  a strategic relationship or joint venture and future equity financings 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will conclude a transaction 
if the recent restructuring and new business strategy implemented by hyperfeed is unsuccessful  its business will be adversely affected 
in october  as part of its transition to a financial services provider serving institutional customers  hyperfeed restructured its operations by reducing its workforce  streamlining operating expenses  and consolidating excess facilities 
hyperfeed has implemented a new business plan  fiscal framework  product strategy  and sales methodology focused on serving the financial institutional marketplace 
for over years  hyperfeed s ticker plant technologies were proprietary and used behind the scenes to process its consolidated market data feed  hyperfeed market data  for its customers 
but in response to market trends demanding direct exchange connectivity  the current model allows the same advanced and robust ticker plant technologies to be used by its customers in a meps model 
this opens new markets for hyperfeed to serve exchanges and content providers as well as financial institutions and redistributors 
if hyperfeed is unsuccessful in implementing its new business strategy or if the anticipated benefits of the restructuring and new business strategy is not realized or does not receive market acceptance  hyperfeed s business will be adversely affected 
we may not be able to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology  evolving industry standards  and client preferences 
the financial information industry and the securities industry are constantly changing and evolving 
recent trends in these industries have included rampant data vendor consolidation  the proliferation of program trading  and the advent of new exchange depth products 
together with the effect of current economic conditions  these factors are influencing financial institutions to get market data feeds directly from each exchange 
while hyperfeed s meps model was introduced in response to these emerging trends  financial market data and securities industries will likely continue to change and evolve 
the success of our business will depend on our ability to successfully foresee  identify  and adapt to evolving trends in the industries in which we operate 
in addition  the financial information industry has experienced and is continuing to experience rapid technological advances and developments 
we are actively engaged in research and development activities to try to meet our customers needs and preferences 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be successful in addressing technological advances and developments on a timely basis or that  if addressed  we will be successful in the marketplace 
a delay or failure to address technological advances and developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that technologies developed by others will not render our products and services noncompetitive or obsolete 
hyperfeed s financial performance is highly dependent on the timely and successful introduction of new products and services 
our financial performance depends in large part upon our ability to successfully develop and market next generation and new products and services in a rapidly changing technological and economic environment 
if we fail to successfully identify new product opportunities and timely develop and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance  we may lose our market share and our future revenue and earnings may suffer 
the continued economic downturn and decrease in the activity in financial markets could negatively affect our revenue  which would reduce our profitability 
our revenue is derived from supplying financial data and quotations related to us financial exchanges and markets 
the current financial market downturn and resulting decrease in activity in the financial markets has and may continue to negatively affect our revenue 
we may not be able to successfully integrate new management 
in august and september  hyperfeed hired a new senior management team 
if we are unable to successfully integrate these new members into our business  it could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
a principal stockholder is in a position to control matters requiring stockholder vote  which may impair investors from realizing maximum returns on their investment in hyperfeed 
a principal stockholder  pico holdings  inc pico  owns or has the right to acquire approximately of our shares of common stock that would be outstanding after they exercised their rights to acquire additional shares 
in addition  pico intends to purchase additional shares in a proposed private placement of our common stock 
accordingly  pico is in a position to control the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote  including the election of directors 
such control could have the effect of discouraging  or making more difficult  an unsolicited acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise  even though an unsolicited acquisition could have resulted in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares or be otherwise economically beneficial to them 
our agreements with exchanges  entitling us to receive information that is necessary for us to conduct our business  could be terminated 
we have agreements in place with various exchanges  which permit us to gather the information we need for our services 
these exchanges include canadian toronto  chicago board of trade mid america commodity exchange  chicago mercantile exchange  montreal  nasdaq  new york board of trade  new york mercantile exchange commodity exchange  new york stock exchange american stock exchange  and options price reporting authority 
our agreement with nasdaq expires on august nd of each year  with automatic one year renewals 
however  either party may terminate the agreement  for any reason whatsoever  upon days written notice 
our agreements with all of the other exchanges listed above have a perpetual duration 
however  each of those agreements may be terminated  for any reason whatsoever  upon days written notice 
all of our agreements with the exchanges listed above may be terminated by such exchanges if any of the following events occur non payment of amounts due  inadequate control systems over dissemination of data  or failure to report the proper number of our subscribers 
the termination  expiration  or non renewal of any of these agreements could inhibit our ability to provide high quality services to our clients and have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we rely on software licensing agreements from third parties that could be terminated or allowed to expire 
we license significant software applications from unaffiliated third parties 
the termination of these license agreements by unaffiliated third parties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
these license agreements are for initial terms and provide for automatic renewals unless terminated by delivering written notice prior to the renewal date 
we compete with companies that have greater financial  technical  and monetary resources than we do  which could result in additional pricing pressures on us and reduce our profitability 
the market for ticker plant technologies used to facilitate and manage the direct exchange feeds of financial institutions in a meps model is opportune and recently developed 
direct competitors on this front include small consulting shops that sell source servers and in house development teams 
currently  they only compete with hyperfeed on the first level of service involving feps and do not presently offer value added services 
the market for the provision of a domestic consolidated data feed containing real time streaming financial information such as equities  commodities  futures and options quotations  and news through services and software applications similar to those we provide includes a large amount of competitors and is subject to rapid change 
the industry has also seen unprecedented m a activity 
we believe our primary competitors include reuters  the ilx unit of thomson corporation and the comstock unit of standard and poor s  which was recently acquired by idc 
these competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources and greater name recognition than we do 
our goal is not to compete with these premiere data providers but to license our technology to them 
nonetheless  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our goal or otherwise compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors 
our subscription contracts for services and software applications may subject us to litigation  which may be costly for us to defend 
many of our subscription contracts are for services and software applications that are critical to the operations of our customers businesses 
the failure or inability to deliver services and software to our customers satisfaction could have a material adverse effect on their operations and could consequently subject us to litigation 
any litigation could cause us to incur legal fees and use management resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
our software may infringe on intellectual property rights of others  which may subject us to litigation 
we believe that our services and software applications do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and that we have all rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in our business 
however  we are subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
we typically license the software we develop for use by our customers  and we generally agree to indemnify our customers against potential third party intellectual property rights claims 
any claims could require us to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  and or acquire licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of asserted infringement 
hyperfeed depends on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues and a loss of current major customers would significantly reduce hyperfeed s revenues 
a limited number of customers historically have accounted for a substantial portion of hyperfeed s revenues 
in the fiscal year ending december   revenues from one customer represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenues for that year 
we did not have any customers that accounted for or more of consolidated revenue in revenues from our largest customer in represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenues for that year 
we cannot predict whether our current customers will continue to use our products 
we have experienced significant changes from year to year in the composition of our major customer base and believe this pattern will continue 
the loss of or a significant reduction in purchases by current major customers that are not offset by corresponding increases from other current or future customers would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we rely heavily on executive officers who do not have employment contracts 
our success is highly dependent upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers 
the loss of services of one or more of our executive officers or other key personnel for any reason could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
although our executive officers have entered into agreements with us that contain nondisclosure covenants  those agreements do not guarantee their continued employment with us 
we continue to recruit financial  technical  and operational personnel 
competition for these people is intense and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified replacements or additional technical or operational personnel 
we may not be successful in finding suitable replacements for any senior management personnel who may leave hyperfeed 
our anti takeover provisions may not be in the best interests of our stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation and by laws  the delaware general corporation law and the exchange act contain certain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging or making more difficult the acquisition of us by means of a tender offer  a proxy contest or otherwise  even though an acquisition might be economically beneficial to our stockholders 
our anti takeover provisions include only the board of directors or an authorized special committee of the board of directors may call meetings of stockholders  and stockholders must comply with certain advance notice procedures to nominate candidates for election as directors and to submit proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 
these provisions may make the removal of management more difficult  even in cases where such removal would be favorable to the interests of our stockholders
