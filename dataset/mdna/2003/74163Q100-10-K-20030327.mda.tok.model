the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase method whereby the purchase price of approximately million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of approximately million has been recorded as goodwill and was being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of three years 
the fair value of the common stock issued in the acquisition was per share  based on the average market price for a three day period before and after may  during the third quarter of  we discontinued funding product development for order  a wholly owned subsidiary

significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
restructuring during and  we recorded significant write offs and accruals in connection with our restructuring program under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
these write offs and accruals include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations related to excess leased facilities and other contracts 
although we believe that we have made reasonable estimates of our restructuring costs in calculating these write offs and accruals  the actual costs could differ from these estimates

 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable and there is vendor specific objective evidence to allocate the total fee to the elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe is typically based on the price charged when an element is sold separately  or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
in multiple element arrangements in which vsoe exists only for undelivered elements  the fair value of the undelivered elements are deferred and the residual arrangement fee is assigned to the delivered elements 
if evidence of fair value for any of the undelivered elements does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
prior to the fourth quarter of  for our eserver and esupport products  revenue from software license agreements was recognized over the software core installation period if sold with installation services or upon delivery of software if sold without installation services  provided all of the other revenue recognition requirements of statement of position no 
had been met 
during the fourth quarter of  we released new versions of these software products  which do not require significant installation efforts 
accordingly  revenue from software license arrangements is recognized upon the delivery of the software  regardless of whether installation services are sold  provided all of the other revenue recognition requirements of statement of position no 
have been met 
this change did not have a material impact upon adoption 
if a customer requires an acceptance period  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
revenue for license arrangements with payment terms extending beyond one year is recognized periodically as payments become due  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition are met 
service revenue consists of maintenance and support fees and consulting  training and hosting fees 
maintenance and support and ongoing hosting fees are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenue is primarily related to implementation and integration services performed on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements related to the use of our software products 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as services are performed 
if a transaction includes both license and service elements  license fees are recognized separately upon delivery of the software  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and the licenses are not subject to acceptance criteria 
from time to time we enter into distribution agreements with resellers that typically provide for sublicense fees based on a percentage of list prices 
our distribution agreement with primus kk  a related party  provides for sublicense fees based on a percentage of net fees collected by primus kk from its customers  subject to certain guaranteed minimum royalty payments 
sublicense fees are recognized upon delivery of software to primus kk if pervasive evidence of an arrangement between the distributor and their customer exists  collection is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists for the undelivered elements 
guaranteed minimum royalty payments  to the extent they exceed sublicense fees due  are recognized in the period earned 
our agreements with our customers and resellers  including primus kk  do not contain product return rights 

table of contents accounts receivable we perform a quarterly analysis to determine the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts

the amortization of goodwill ceases upon the required adoption date of the statement  which for us was january  at the date of adoption  we had unamortized goodwill of approximately million  and the implied fair value of the goodwill as of the date of adoption was zero 
the implied fair value of goodwill was calculated based upon a comparison of the book value of the company to its fair value 
fair value was determined based upon the market capitalization of the company as of january  accordingly  we recognized a million transitional impairment loss as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as a result of the adoption of sfas no

the increase in maintenance and support contract revenue as a percentage of total revenue is primarily due to the significant decrease in license revenue 
the decrease in maintenance and support contract revenue and consulting fees are by products of continued pricing pressures  the termination of certain low margin maintenance and support contracts and the declines in both license revenue and information technology spending experienced during the current year

cost of service revenue will vary depending on the mix of services that we provide between support and maintenance  training  implementation and integration services  as well as staffing levels  overhead costs and customer needs 
gross profit margins are generally higher for post contract customer support and maintenance services  which include the delivery of software enhancements and upgrades  than for training  implementation and integration services 
we anticipate that cost of service revenue will decrease in the

other income  net 
other income decreased million  or  from million in to  in the decrease from period to period is primarily due to fluctuations in the average combined cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as well as declining investment yields

we reduced our workforce by people  or of our employee base in october  and all functional areas were affected by the reductions

a portion of the charge was based on the estimated period to sublease the excess space and the then current estimated lease rental rates for leases in the respective market

our quarterly operating results have varied widely in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
liquidity and capital resources we have primarily financed our operations through the sale of our equity securities 
to a lesser extent  we have financed our operations through equipment financing and traditional lending arrangements 
in july  we completed our initial public offering in which we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions  and other offering costs 

table of contents as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  representing a decrease of million from december  as of december   our working capital was million compared to million at december  our operating activities resulted in net cash outflows of million and million in and  respectively 
in  adjustments to the million net loss to reconcile to cash used in operating activities includes million for the decrease in compensation related accruals  accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue 
this is offset by approximately million for the decrease in accounts receivable  prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets  million in depreciation and amortization  a million charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and  loss related to assets disposed of or removed from operations 
investing activities provided cash of million and million in and  respectively 
investing activities for this period consisted primarily of approximately million in proceeds from the maturity of short term investments offset by the purchase of approximately  in capital equipment 
financing activities provided cash of  in through proceeds from the issuance of common stock and used cash of  in our principal source of liquidity at december  is our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we also have a line of credit totaling million  which is secured by substantially all of our assets  bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus as of december  and expires in december there were no borrowings outstanding as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with our financial covenants in connection with the line of credit 
if primus is unable to maintain compliance in the future  this million line of credit may not be available in its entirety 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to experience fluctuations in results of operations for the foreseeable future as we enter new markets for our products and services  including through potential acquisitions of complementary businesses  technology or other assets increase or decrease research and development spending increase or decrease sales and marketing activities develop new distribution channels improve our operational and financial systems broaden our professional services capabilities we continue to focus on maximizing the performance of our core business and controlling costs to respond to the economic environment 
during the fourth quarter of  and again during the first and third quarters of  the company executed restructuring plans to reduce headcount and infrastructure  and to eliminate excess leased facilities 
during  we recorded  in restructuring and other related charges 
restructuring charges for the year ended december  totaled  included in restructuring and other related charges are excess facilities and asset impairment charges recorded in and  which are the result of the company s decision to exit certain domestic and international facilities 
excess facilities and asset impairment charges for the year ended december  were estimated at  based on its evaluation of current market conditions relative to its existing excess facilities accrual 
the estimated facilities costs are based on current comparable rates for leases and subleases of a comparable term or termination fees 
the asset impairment charges are primarily for leasehold improvements  computer equipment and related software  office equipment and furniture and fixtures disposed of or removed 
table of contents from operations as a direct result of the restructuring plans 
if estimates and or assumptions change  the actual loss may differ from this estimate 
future cash outlays of approximately  are anticipated through june unless the company is able to negotiate to exit the leases at an earlier date 
included in restructuring and other related charges are employee separation and other costs for the year ended december   which included severance  benefits and associated costs of approximately  related to reductions in our workforce during the first and third quarter of we reduced our research and development workforce by employees  or  our sales marketing workforce by employees  or  our professional services and support workforce by employees  or  and our general and administrative workforce by employees  or  for a total workforce reduction of people  or of our employee base from december  as we continue to evaluate our underlying cost structure to improve our operating results and better position ourselves for growth  we may incur further restructuring charges  including severance  benefits and related costs due to a reduction in workforce and charges for assets disposed of or removed from operations as a direct result of a reduction in workforce 
in the near term  we believe our costs and operating expenses  excluding restructuring related charges  will continue to decrease to a level that is closer to our expected revenue while allowing us to continue to invest in accordance with our strategic priorities 
however  we may be unable to achieve these expense reductions without adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
we may continue to experience losses and negative cash flows in the near term  even if sales of our products and services grow 
we lease office space under operating leases with various expiration dates through future minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  are as follows operating leases in thousands total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of approximately  on leases due in the future under non cancelable subleases and include  related to excess facilities 
rent expense was approximately million net of sublease rental income of  million net of sublease rental income of  and million for  and  respectively 
we have no material long term commitments or obligations other than those under these leases 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide any funding to any such entity 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
while we will continue to implement cost containment efforts across our business  our operating expenses  including costs to defend and or settle legal actions that have been or may be brought against us  will consume a material amount of our cash resources 
we believe that the total amount of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  along with our commercial credit facilities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash 
table of contents needs for working capital or other purposes for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  depending on the development of our business  we will likely require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  unanticipated problems or expenses  opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives we encounter 
accordingly  we may seek to raise additional working capital through public or private equity or debt including debt convertible into equity financing or from other sources 
in such event  we may not be able to obtain adequate funding and our recent history of declining market valuation  volatility in our stock price and doubts surrounding our future eligibility to remain listed on the nasdaq small capmarket could make it difficult for us to raise capital on favorable terms 
any financing we obtain may dilute or otherwise impair our current shareholders ownership interest in the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and related change in the market values of our investments and foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate risk 
we typically invest our excess cash in high quality corporate and municipal debt instruments 
as a result  our related investment portfolio is exposed to the impact of short term changes in interest rates 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carries a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
as a result  changes in interest rates may cause us to suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value or may cause our future investment income to fall short of expectations 
our investment portfolio is designated as available for sale  and accordingly is presented at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet 
we protect and preserve our invested funds with investment policies and procedures that limit default  market and reinvestment risk 
we have not utilized derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
during the year ended december   decreases in interest rates on the fair market value of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities caused an insignificant increase in our net loss 
a fixed rate short term investment at december  of approximately million had an interest rate of and is due in we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and our earnings for from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would be insignificant 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we develop products in the united states and sell them in north america  europe  and  through primus kk  asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
we have two foreign subsidiaries primus knowledge solutions uk limited and primus knowledge solutions 
table of contents france whose expenses are incurred in their local currency 
our operating results have not been significantly affected by exchange rate fluctuations in and if  during  the us dollar uniformly increases or decreases in strength by relative to the currency of our foreign sales subsidiaries  our operating results for would likely not be significantly affected
