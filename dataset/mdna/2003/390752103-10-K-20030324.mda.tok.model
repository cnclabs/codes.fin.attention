item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands results of operations trends in  occupancy rates in the current markets declined due to increases in supply and decreases in demand for office space 
the market trend of occupancy declines has impacted the company s portfolio performance and  as a result  the overall portfolio occupancy of the company s properties declined to at the end of as compared to at the end of during  the company averaged approximately  square feet of new leasing activity per month 
the company believes that the trend of vacancy increases is slowing  but the company anticipates that the difficult leasing environment that currently exists in its markets will persist throughout as improvement in demand for office space usually lags the beginning of an economic recovery 
as of january   the company had  square feet of leases expiring in  or of the portfolio 
the company currently expects to retain or renew  to  square feet of the  square feet of leases expiring during the company anticipates it will again average  per month of new leasing activity in  basically the same level as was experienced in the very difficult environment of based on the tenant retention and new leasing activity expectations noted above  the company expects that average portfolio occupancy during will be in the range of to 
occupancy at january  is expected to be in the range of to assuming no significant tenant defaults occur during the year

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue recognition regarding reimbursement income  estimation of accrued real estate taxes  fair value of interest rate swap agreements  impairment and disposal of long lived assets  including goodwill  accounting for employee share options and restricted shares  and depreciation and amortization  each of which we discuss below 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate whether accounts receivable from tenants  including straight line rents  are collectible using the specific identification method 
in circumstances where a specific tenant has defaulted on its financial obligations to us  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we think will be collected 
if a tenant s circumstances change an unexpected material adverse change in a tenant s financial condition that precludes them from meeting their financial obligations  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
revenue recognition reimbursement income under the terms of our tenant leases  tenants pay a portion of the real estate taxes and property operating expenses of the property they occupy to us as reimbursement income 
tenants generally pay an estimate of these amounts to us monthly 
as of december of each year  we record as a receivable or payable the difference between the computed reimbursement income and the monthly estimates paid to us by the tenant even though the amount receivable or payable will not be billed or credited to the tenant until the next calendar year 
such amounts recorded do vary from the actual amounts billed to the tenants but the differences in prior years have not been material 
accrued real estate taxes use of estimates for certain properties owned by us  real estate taxes for the current calendar year are not due and payable until the next calendar year 
we estimate the amounts due the local taxing authorities based on historical trends for a particular property or local area 
we also use information from real estate tax consultants who review for the company the methodology used by the local taxing authorities to determine valuation of our properties and the tax rates used to determine the real estate taxes we owe 
if a local taxing authority were to change the methodology it uses to determine real estate taxes  the amounts estimated to be paid in future years could vary from our estimates 
fair value of interest rate swap agreements we value these agreements based on information provided to us by a third party 
such valuations are based on various factors  including current market conditions  assumptions regarding forward yield curves and other matters 
changes in such factors could significantly affect the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
impairment and disposal of long lived assets  including goodwill in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted this standard effective january  this standard stipulates that amortization of goodwill will not be recorded subsequent to adoption and instead periodic evaluation of impairment will be required 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted this standard effective january  this standard stipulates that operating results  including gain or loss on sale  of all properties sold  or designated as held for sale  subsequent to the effective date will be reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its real estate properties and goodwill  for impairment indicators 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal factors 
future events may occur that would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that an impairment loss is warranted 
accounting for employee share options and restricted shares the company uses the intrinsic value method permitted by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  in accounting for its options on common shares 
under apb  no compensation expense is recognized because the exercise price of the company s employee share options equals or exceeds the market price of the underlying shares at the date of grant 
net income and earnings per share would vary from amounts reported if we followed fasb statement accounting for stock based compensation  and accounted for our employee share options under the fair value method of that statement 
depreciation and amortization policy depreciation of buildings is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  generally years 
depreciation of tenant improvements is computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or useful life 
deferred leasing commissions are amortized over the lease term 
the company estimates the useful life of its assets based upon market conditions  economic and physical obsolescence factors and other items 
a change in any of these factors may cause the company to revise the estimated useful life of its assets 
future unanticipated tenant defaults and bankruptcies may cause the company to shorten the depreciation period for tenant improvements and the amortization period for deferred leasing commissions with a resulting increase in depreciation or amortization expense
