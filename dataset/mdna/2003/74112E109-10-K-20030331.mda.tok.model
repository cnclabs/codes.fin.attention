item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
recent developments in september  the company released for sale its first commercial products and services utilizing the company s patented pressure cycling technology pct which was developed by the company during the past several years 
on october   the company retained an investment banking firm to advise the company in the evaluation of strategic opportunities aimed at increasing shareholder value and liquidity by increasing the capital needed for growth 
on february   the company announced the termination of its chairman and chief executive officer  the company subsequently appointed as chairman mr 
william a 
wilson  an existing independent member of the board of directors 
a special committee of the company s board of directors has been appointed to oversee management of the affairs of the company until such time as a new chief executive officer is employed 
overview the company generates revenue from products and services provided primarily to the in vitro diagnostic infectious disease industry 
the company currently has four operating segments diagnostics  biotech  laboratory instrumentation and pressure cycling technology  pct 
two of these  diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation primarily manufacture products 
commencing in  pct products are being manufactured at the laboratory instrumentation segment 
within the diagnostics segment  there are three major product lines quality control panels  accurun external run controls  and diagnostic components 
the remaining two segments  biotech and pct  generate primarily service revenue 
within biotech there are four major product lines contract research  repository services  specialty reagents and research services 
revenue in the pct segment consists primarily of both private and national institutes of health nih funded support for the research activities associated with our pressure cycling technology 
there was also nih funding in for the company s former drug discovery operations which were spun off as an independent company in november see note of notes to financial statements for a further discussion of the activities of these segments and note of notes to financial statements relative to the company s discontinued clinical laboratory operations 
effective january  all of the company s technology related to its drug discovery and vaccine programs  consisting primarily of patents and related sponsored research agreements  were transferred to panacos pharmaceuticals  inc panacos  a former wholly owned subsidiary that the company formed in october in november and in february  panacos sold equity to third party investors  reducing the company s ownership to approximately which is held in non voting preferred stock 
as a result  the company no longer consolidates the results of panacos 
as of november  the company s investment in panacos was zero and the company is no longer required to fund panacos s operations 
therefore no further losses of panacos will be recorded by the company 
the company believes that this will position panacos to progress to more advanced stages of drug development including clinical trials  while at the same time allowing our management to focus more time on the company s core business 
in december  the company made a decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing services segment and in february  bbi clinical laboratories  inc bbicl  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  sold the business and certain assets and liabilities to a third party for an adjusted purchase price of  the escrow account was terminated in december by mutual agreement between the buyer and the company  resulting in approximately  being received by the company from the escrow account 
the company has retained certain other assets and liabilities of bbicl  primarily property  plant and equipment  together with the facility lease subsequent to the closing date  which the company is attempting to sublease 
the company wrote down all of the retained assets to their estimated net realizable value 
the company recorded an after tax gain of  in and an additional after tax gain of  in the remaining estimate of closing costs  which is periodically revised and updated to reflect new information  included an estimate of costs associated with disposing of all remaining assets and retiring all existing liabilities including a facility lease 
the company utilized in certain prior period net operating loss carryforwards  previously reserved for by the company  to partially offset the tax effect of this gain 
in accordance with a transition services agreement  the company operated the business in a normal fashion from the date of closing to december  during which substantially all costs associated with operation of the business subsequent to the closing date were borne by the purchaser 
products the economics and cost structures of the company s business segments have certain differences 
the diagnostics segment has historically been the largest and most profitable segment  both in absolute dollars and in operating profit margin  as it operates primarily in a commercial environment with fewer competitors and relatively short product development cycles 
the laboratory instrumentation segment had been in decline for several years prior to its acquisition in mid  and management continues in its efforts to turn around this business  this segment commenced the manufacture of pct products for commercial sale in year it operates in a highly competitive  low margin business contract manufacturing of instruments and medical devices 
at the current low annual revenue level of less than million  it operates significantly under capacity with high fixed overhead costs  and should therefore significantly benefit from relatively small revenue increases 
services bbi biotech has been project oriented with a high proportion of its revenue generated from government contracts for both research and service activities and assisting the other segments in their new product and service development 
it has the highest level of inter segment activity  and is structured around project tracking of direct costs plus overhead  general and administrative costs and a low percentage fee 
its financial goal has been to breakeven  prior to the allocation of corporate overhead while contributing to the development of future products and services for the company 
the pct segment s research and development operation launched its first products for commercial sale in revenue to date consists primarily of private and public nih funding of segment research 
most of the expenditures by this segment are for r d expenses  patent costs and general management expenses 
the company continues to seek funding from both private and public sources to minimize the impact of their development costs on the company s overall operating results 
panacos pharmaceuticals obtained independent third party equity financing in november thus terminating the company s responsibility going forward to fund future research and development activities of panacos 
in february  panacos raised million in additional equity thereby diluting the company s interest in non voting preferred shares of panacos to 
quarterly fluctuations historically  the company s results of operations have been subject to quarterly fluctuations due to a variety of factors  primarily customer purchasing patterns  driven by end of year expenditures 
in particular  in the diagnostics segment  the company s sales of its off the shelf quality control products and diagnostic components typically have been highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each fiscal year  whereas oem product sales may peak in any quarter of the year  depending on the production cycle of a given project 
in the company s biotech segment  research contracts are generally for large dollar amounts spread over one to five year periods  and upon completion  frequently do not have renewal phases 
as a result these contracts can cause large fluctuations in revenue and net income 
in addition to staff dedicated to internal research and development  certain of the company s technical staff work on both contract research for customers and company sponsored research and development 
the allocation of certain technical staff to such projects depends on the volume of contract research 
as a result  research and development expenditures fluctuate due to increases or decreases in contract research performed 
neither the laboratory instrumentation segment nor the pct segment is subject to material seasonal variations 
research and development since the acquisition of bioseq  inc in  the company has expended significant amounts for ongoing research and development of new technologies in pct and panacos only 
in the past four years  the company s bioseq research subsidiary has incurred approximately m of research and development expenses substantially related to development of a unique instrument and disposable specimen processing tube in conjunction with pct 
since  the company has made major progress towards the goal of commercializing pct products and  in september  the company released for sale its first products based on its patented pct 
the company is presently manufacturing the barocycler instrument and disposable pulse tubes utilizing pct at its bbi source scientific facility 
the company has received nine domestic and two foreign patents for this technology as of the end of the company has invested significantly in research and development  both in whole dollars and as a percentage of revenue  and expects to continue to do so for the foreseeable future as it seeks to continue to develop new applications for pct 
in addition to ongoing development of new accurun products  the company has also incurred  for development costs on reagent purification projects 
the company has also incurred  for development costs on an accuchart plus software development project 
research and development expenses incurred in year also include approximately  related to panacos pharmaceuticals drug discovery and development program 
export sales the company does not have any foreign operations 
however  the company does have significant export sales in europe  the pacific rim countries and canada to agents under distribution agreements  as well as directly to test kit manufacturers 
all sales are denominated in us dollars 
export sales for the years ended december    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
the company expects that export sales will continue to be a significant source of revenue and gross profit 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the percentage of total revenue represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations year ended december  revenue products services total revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative impairment of intangible asset total operating expenses operating loss from continuing operations interest expense  net loss before income taxes and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision for income taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income loss from discontinued operations net income loss product gross profit services gross profit critical accounting policies and estimates to prepare the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  significant estimates were made in determining the gain on disposition of the company s discontinued operations including post closing adjustments  in estimating future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets  in determining the ultimate cost of abandoning a lease associated with discontinued operations at a facility no longer being utilized  in estimates regarding the collectability of accounts receivable  realizability of a loan made to the former chairman and chief executive officer including sufficiency of collateral see note  deferred tax assets  the net realizable value of its inventory  as well as an estimate for other remaining liabilities associated with discontinued operations 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used by management 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue is recognized when realized or earned when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of the products 
the company will occasionally recognize revenue on a bill and hold basis after completion of manufacture for specific orders at the request of the customer 
bill and hold sales transactions are entered into after consideration of customer needs and capabilities relating to freezer capability to store biological substances at required temperatures 
all bill and hold transactions meet specified revenue recognition criteria that include the risk of ownership has passed to the customer  the customer has a fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the customer  not the company  has requested the transaction to be on a bill and hold basis  there is a fixed schedule for delivery of the goods  we do not retain any specific performance obligations such that the earnings process is not complete  the ordered goods are segregated from our inventory and not subject to being used to fill other orders  and the goods must be complete and ready for shipment 
the company also considers the following prior to recognizing revenue the transaction is subject to normal billing and credit terms for the specific customer  the company s past experience with the pattern of bill and hold transactions  whether the customer has the expected risk of loss in the event of a decline in the market value of the goods  whether our custodial risks are insurable and insured  whether apb  pertaining to the need to discounting the related receivables  is applicable  and whether extended procedures are necessary in order to assure that there are no exceptions to the customer s commitment to accept and pay for the goods 
total revenue related to bill and hold transactions was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
revenue from service contracts is earned as the related services are performed 
revenue arrangements where multiple products or services are sold together under one contract are evaluated to determine if each element represents a separate earnings process 
in the event that an element of such multiple element arrangement does not represent a separate earnings process  revenue from this element is recognized over the term of the related contract 
services are recognized as revenue upon completion of tests for laboratory services 
revenue from service contracts and research and development contracts for the company s laboratory instrumentation business is recognized as the service and research and development activities are performed under the terms of the contracts 
revenue under long term contracts  generally lasting from one to five years  including funded research and development contracts  is recorded when costs to perform such research and development activities are incurred 
billings under long term contracts are generally at cost plus a predetermined profit 
billings occur as costs associated with time and materials are incurred 
customers are obligated to pay for such services  when billed  and payments are non refundable 
on occasion certain customers make advance payments that are deferred until revenue recognition is appropriate 
total revenue related to long term contracts was approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
total contract costs associated with these agreements were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in the revenue recognized under long term contracts are certain unbilled receivables representing additional indirect costs  which are allowed under the terms of the respective contracts 
unbilled receivables were less than  for all years presented 
during the fiscal years   and  the combined revenues from all branches of the national institutes of health  a united states government agency  accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total consolidated revenues from continuing operations of the company 
additional future revenues originating from various branches of the national institutes of health is subject to possible future changes in government funding levels 
accounts receivable management periodically reviews outstanding balances in accounts receivable to determine future collections 
based on our historical experience  current business conditions and expected future collections  management established an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
in the event circumstances change to affect the assumptions underlying this allowance  we might be required to take additional write offs of our accounts receivable balances 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
certain factors may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  changes in product mix strategy  new product introductions and significant changes to our cost structure 
in addition  estimates of reserves are made for obsolescence based on the current product mix on hand and its expected net realizability 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write downs or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we treat lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory reserves as an adjustment to the cost basis of the underlying inventory 
accordingly  favorable changes in market conditions are not recorded to inventory in subsequent periods 
long lived assets and goodwill intangible assets primarily relate to the remaining value of acquired patents associated with pct 
the cost of these acquired patents is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated life of the patent which is generally four to sixteen years 
our policy regarding long lived assets is to evaluate the recoverability or usefulness of these assets when the facts and circumstances suggest that these assets may be impaired 
this analysis relies on a number of factors  including changes in strategic direction  business plans  regulatory developments  economic and budget projections  technological improvements  and operating results 
the test of recoverability or usefulness is a comparison of the asset value to the undiscounted cash flow of its expected cumulative net operating cash flow over the asset s remaining useful life 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset and an operating loss would be recognized 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses in the pct segment and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan that includes expected revenues and cash flows to be generated from sales of pct products and services 
our goodwill relates to our acquisition of the source operating segment 
this segment is expected to manufacture pct related products and realizability of this goodwill is dependant  among other factors  on the success of our pct product line 
if we are unable to execute our business plans related to pct  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets and goodwill in future periods 
deferred tax valuation allowance a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in the year  the company established a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and in consideration of three consecutive years of losses 
the company has not recognized an income tax benefit associated with the loss from continuing operations in years  and  as these tax assets have been fully reserved for 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset due to the uncertainty of realization 
discontinued operations the company periodically reviews the adequacy of its reserve for discontinued operations associated with the company s decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing segment of the business in the company has established reserves to cover expected future costs including those associated with an existing facility lease expiring july pledge to former chairman and chief executive officer as of december   the company evaluated the recoverability of the restricted cash used as pledge for its former chairman and chief executive officer 
the company s review includes an evaluation of the collateral associated with the loan 
the company maintains a junior interest in this collateral 
the collateral consists of real estate holdings and common stock of the company 
when considering the adequacy of the collateral  the company considers the balance of the loan outstanding with this financial institution and the fact that the company has a junior position in regards to the collateral as well as the liquidity and net realizable value of the assets underlying the collateral 
the company s analysis assumed transactions costs to sell the properties  and applied a liquidity discount to the trading value of the common stock 
the ultimate value that may be recovered by the company is dependant on numerous factors including market conditions relative to the real estate  the value of and ability to sell the company s common stock  and the financial status of its former chairman and chief executive officer 
at december   the company performed a test for impairment of the restricted cash by analyzing the value of the collateral  and determined that the restricted cash was not impaired 
while the restricted cash was not impaired as of december   the termination of the company s chairman and chief executive officer by the board of directors in february  together with the decline in the quoted market value of the company s common stock  which comprises a major element of the collateral  are indicators of impairment 
based on the company s assessment as of and through march   the company estimates that the value of the collateral has declined below the amount of the company s recorded loan 
accordingly  the company estimates it may record a valuation reserve against this asset in the three months ended march  in the range of  to  if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional write downs of this assets might be required 
years ended december  and revenue total revenue from continuing operations increased  or  to  in year from  in year the increase in revenue was the result of a increase in service revenue or  to  in from  in  partially offset by a small decrease in product revenue of  or  to  in from  in product revenue 
the decrease of  in product revenue was due primarily to decreases of product sales at the biotech segment and a decrease of  of product sales at the laboratory instrumentation segment the latter segment experienced strong sales to existing customers in the first half of 
service revenue 
the  increase in service revenue was primarily related to strong activity in two service contracts related to hiv vaccine development and hepatitis c work at the biotech segment the former resulting from increased revenue for the biotech segment as the result of increased activity from a subcontractor  and increased grant revenue at the company s pct segment 
gross profit overall gross profit decreased  or  to  in from  in product gross profit decreased  or  to  in from  in  product gross margin declined to in from in services gross profit increased or  to  in from  in  while service gross margin increased to in from in product gross margin 
a decrease in both product gross profit and margin was associated with increased sales of higher margin catalog products in at the diagnostics segment and higher raw material costs in  a decrease in high margin product sales at the biotech segment in  and lower revenues from instrument sales in over a relatively fixed cost structure which includes increased costs associated with a facility lease renewal effective in february coupled with a facility sublease that expired in january at the laboratory instrumentation segment 
service gross margin 
the increase in both service gross profit and margin was primarily due to increased activity associated with two service contracts related to hiv vaccine development and hepatitis c work at the biotech segment  partially offset increased wage expense and higher facility operating costs at the biotech segment in research and development research and development expenditures increased  or  to  in from  in the increased level of expenditures was associated with ongoing pct related projects including optimization protocols for various tissue types 
in addition  there was an increase in development work on accuchart plus  a quality control data management software program for analyzing  tracking and archiving daily run control data for monitoring test kit performance 
since the company s acquisition of bioseq inc in  the company has invested significantly in research and development  both in whole dollars and as a percentage of revenue  and expects to continue to do so for the foreseeable future  as it seeks to develop new applications for pct 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in the company incurred significant marketing and promotion related costs in primarily associated with its introduction of the pct barocycler at the pittsburgh conference industry trade show and related ongoing sales  marketing and promotion efforts associated with the september commercial launch of the pct barocycler  and expects these pct related activities to continue in general and administrative general and administrative costs increased  or  to  in from  in  due to higher wage and facility lease and utility costs incurred in partially offset by a one time  credit associated with a telecommunications claim and the cessation  commencing january  of amortization of goodwill associated with the laboratory instrumentation segment  compared to  in which the company benefited from the reversal of an  legal expense accrual associated with the june legal settlement reached with paradigm group  llc 
in the second quarter of  the company increased its provision for doubtful accounts by  based on a significant deterioration in the financial condition of a customer in its diagnostics segment

the biotech segment s operating loss increased to  in from  in  a increase in service revenues coupled with an increase in service gross margin was more than offset by increased sales and marketing expenses and increased general and administrative expenses 
the operating loss of the pct segment increased to  in from  in due to increased research and development costs associated with the final phases of product development and advanced prototype manufacture and increased sales  promotion and marketing costs associated with the commercial launch  in late september of  of the pct barocycler 
the company continues evaluate the market for the pct barocycler  as the sales cycle appears to be longer in duration than originally envisioned 
while the company believes strongly in the benefits of pct s novel technology  the market potential of the existing pct barocycler appears uncertain 
the manufacture of pct products at the laboratory instrument segment of the business was part of the company s plan to return bbi source scientific  inc to profitability in year the company intends to evaluate other applications and products utilizing pct and to reexamine the core contract manufacturing business of bbi source scientific  inc if the company is unable to execute its business plans related to pct  we may be required to write down the value of our intangible long lived assets and goodwill in future periods

the company retained certain other assets and liabilities of bbicl  primarily property  plant and equipment  together with the facility lease subsequent to the closing date  which the company is attempting to sublease 
the company wrote down all of the retained assets not otherwise redistributed to other business units to their estimated net realizable value 
the company has accrued  as of december  for its estimate of remaining liabilities to exit the clinical laboratory testing business 
the major component of this remaining accrual is estimated lease exit and facility related costs  with the remainder for health care claims  other regulatory audit adjustments  and for other miscellaneous costs associated with exiting this business segment 
the company adjusted its estimated remaining liability in the third quarter and recorded an after tax gain of  revenues from discontinued operations  net of intercompany eliminations  were  in the period january  to february  operating losses from discontinued operations was for the year ended december  and were and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company recorded a gain of  net of taxes of  in income loss from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  as discussed above  and  for the year ended december  the company utilized prior period net operating loss carryforwards  previously reserved for by the company in  to partially offset the tax effect of this gain 
additionally  the company took a tax benefit of  related to stock option exercises that was not previously recorded as the company was in a loss position  this tax benefit was recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital in the first quarter of in accordance with a transition services agreement  the company operated the clinical laboratory business on behalf of the buyer during the period february  through december although most operations ceased activity by the end of june all of the revenues generated by  and substantially all costs associated with operating the business subsequent to the closing date of the transaction were the responsibility of the purchaser 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to redeem all outstanding debentures and to retire the company s line of credit in the first quarter of net income loss the company had a net loss of  in as compared to net income of  in the net loss included an after tax gain of  from discontinued operations  whereas in  the company recorded an after tax gain of  associated with discontinued operations

the product revenue increase was primarily attributable to increased sales of basematrix and characterized specimens to ivd test kit manufacturers and continued strong domestic sales of accurun external run controls in the diagnostics segment 
service revenue 
the biotech segment experienced a significant increase in repository and research services revenue 
in addition  service revenue recognized in also included  of funding received by panacos for drug discovery activities  as noted above  the company no longer consolidates the results of operations of panacos 
gross profit overall gross profit increased  or  to  in from  for product gross profit increased  or  to  in from  for  product gross margin increased to in from in services gross profit increased  to  in from  for and service gross margin increased to in from in product gross margin 
the increase in product gross margin at the diagnostics segment resulted from increased sales of higher margin catalog products coupled with a higher level of sales 
in addition  product gross margin increased at the laboratory instrumentation segment driven by the cost reduction plan implemented in september in  the company recorded charges for inventory valuation at both of these segments  offsetting the increases in gross margins 
service gross margin 
the increase in service gross margin was due to an increase in higher margin commercial services as well as increased repository revenue  both performed at the biotech segment 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased  or  to  in from  in research and development expenses in included  associated with panacos  the results of which are no longer included in the company s results of operation as discussed above 
exclusive of funding to panacos in  research and development expenses increased  in  most of which was driven by higher research and development spending on the company s pct program activities 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased by  or  to  in from  in this increase was a result of filling several sales and marketing positions in the latter part of as well as increased travel and promotion costs at the diagnostic segment 
general and administrative general and administrative costs declined  or  to  in from  in this decrease was primarily a result of several factors 
first  there were headcount reductions at corporate  and the diagnostics and laboratory instrumentation segments in the latter part of and into second  there was a significantly lower level of professional fees in compared to  when the company explored several strategic and financing options  also in  the company reversed  of expenses previously accrued in  based on the june legal settlement reached with paradigm group  llc  as discussed further in the accompanying footnotes to the financial statements 
finally  a portion of the decline was associated with the september write down of goodwill at the laboratory instrumentation segment  thereby reducing amortization expense in by  compared to the year impairment of intangible asset as part of an ongoing strategic review process  the company s board of directors met in late september to review the progress of its laboratory instrumentation segment  and that segment s prospects for the future to determine if any impairment of the segment s goodwill had occurred 
based on information presented at that meeting and subsequent analyses showing lower revenue expectations  management approved a cost reduction plan including a headcount reduction  salary freeze  and sublease of excess manufacturing space 
using the lower revenue projections associated with this plan  the laboratory instrumentation segment s undiscounted future cash flows were projected to be less than the carrying value of that segment s goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  this segment s goodwill was written down by approximately  in the third quarter of operating income loss operating loss from continuing operations decreased to  in versus  in the diagnostics segment s operating income increased to  in from  in  due to an increase in product revenue coupled with an increase in product gross margin  but partially offset by an increased absorption of corporate overhead by this segment as explained further below 
the laboratory instrumentation segment had an operating loss of  for versus a loss for of  the results of operation include a charge of  taken in the third quarter of related to impairment of intangible assets as discussed further above  whereas the operating results reflect the impact of the september cost reduction plan 
the pct segment had an operating loss of  in as compared to an operating loss of  in  also in  panacos incurred a  pre tax operating loss  the company no longer consolidates the results of operation of panacos subsequent to november as previously discussed 
effective january  the company adjusted its allocation of corporate overhead based upon a revised corporate structure effective in the present corporate structure reflects the company s implementation  in the latter part of  of a cost reduction plan at the laboratory instrumentation segment  the company s spin off of panacos as an independent company  and the company s decision to exit the clinical laboratory testing business 
the latter item is reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the company ceased allocating corporate overhead to the clinical laboratory testing business for all periods presented 
this adjustment results in the diagnostics unit absorbing a large portion of corporate overhead  which in prior years would have been allocated to panacos and the clinical laboratory testing business 
interest expense cumulative change in accounting principle interest expense decreased from  in to  in the large portion of the decrease is associated with reduced interest expense incurred in on the company s line of credit  which was outstanding for all of but was repaid and terminated by the company in february as discussed further in the section discontinued operations below 
additional interest expense was incurred in associated with the company obtaining a  net mortgage on its west bridgewater ma facility in april in  the company incurred a charge of  including  for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements due to amortization of the beneficial conversion feature  warrant costs and original issue discount debt issuance costs associated with the company s august issuance of  senior subordinated convertible debentures the debentures 
in the first quarter of  the company redeemed the remaining  face value of the outstanding debentures plus accrued interest and a premium of  which was charged to interest expense 
the pro rata portion of unamortized original issue discount  debt issuance and warrant related costs associated with the redeemed debentures  amounting to approximately  is included in the loss on extinguishment of the debentures

the company has retained certain other assets and liabilities of bbicl  primarily property  plant and equipment  together with the facility lease subsequent to the closing date  which the company is attempting to sublease 
the company has written down all of the retained assets not otherwise redistributed to other business units to their estimated net realizable value 
in connection with the sale of the business and certain assets and liabilities of bbicl  the company recorded a gain of  net of taxes of  in the company utilized prior period net operating loss carryforwards  previously reserved for by the company  to partially offset the tax effect of this gain 
additionally  in  the company recognized a tax benefit of approximately  related to stock option exercises that was not previously recorded as the company was in a loss position 
this tax benefit was recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital in the company recorded its estimate of remaining short and long term accrued liabilities to exit the clinical laboratory testing business  totaling approximately  as of december  the major components of this accrual are estimated income taxes  severance and other employee related costs  estimated lease exit and facility related costs  and potential health care claims and other related potential audit adjustments  with the remainder for other miscellaneous costs associated with exiting this business segment 
revenues from discontinued operations  net of intercompany eliminations  were  for the period from january  to february  and  for the year ended december  operating losses from discontinued operations were  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  in summary  income loss from discontinued operations was  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  in accordance with a transition services agreement  the company operated the business in a normal fashion during the period february  through december all of the revenues generated by  and substantially all costs associated with operating the business subsequent to the closing date of the transaction were the responsibility of the purchaser 
a portion of the proceeds from this sale were used to redeem all outstanding debentures and to retire the company s line of credit in the first quarter of summary in summary  the company had net income of  for the year ended december  as compared to a net loss of  for the year ended december  this improvement was driven by four factors first and foremost  the gain recognized on the sale of the company s clinical laboratory testing business  second  a significantly reduced operating loss in compared to as all business units posted improved operating results  and panacos which incurred a pretax loss of  in no longer being consolidated in  third  the impairment of intangible assets at the laboratory instrumentation segment recorded in  which increased the loss for  and fourthly  higher interest expense in due to the higher debt carried prior to the repayments that occurred after the sale of the clinical laboratory testing business 
the earnings per share computation for reflects both the issuance of  additional shares of common stock in the first quarter of  as certain holders of the debentures exercised their rights to convert  of such debentures into shares of the company s common stock  and the issuance of  additional shares of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options  warrants and purchases made pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  on june   the company and paradigm group  llc entered into an agreement to permanently settle their disputes 
under the terms of the agreement  paradigm group  llc rescinded their exercise of the common stock purchase warrants  which have since expired  and the company retained the  shares associated with their exercise 
these shares were included in the total shares outstanding as well as in the calculation of earnings loss per share from february  the date of exercise through june  the date of the agreement 
as of september  these shares were cancelled by the company 
in december  an additional  shares of common stock were subscribed to and paid for by a group of investors for  these shares were issued in the first quarter of and therefore were not included in the total shares outstanding as well as in the calculation of earnings loss per share for the year ended december  liquidity and financial condition as of december   the company had approximately million in working capital 
at december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  excluding restricted cash of  compared to cash of  at december  in january  the  of restricted cash pledged to a financial institution to secure the company s limited guarantee of a loan from the financial institution to an entity controlled by richard t 
schumacher  the company s former chairman and chief executive officer  was used to satisfy the company s guaranty obligation to the financial institution as discussed further below 
the company has experienced operating losses from continuing operations of  and  and has experienced negative cash flows from operations of  and  for the years ended december and  respectively 
in addition  it is anticipated there may be additional working capital requirements in connection with pct barocycler sales and marketing activities 
management has met its recent historical cash flow needs by managing its working capital and utilizing proceeds from the february sale of one of its business segments 
it plans to manage its future liquidity needs through cost reductions and additional selling initiatives 
net cash used in operations for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the operational use of cash during was primarily the result of the operating loss incurred coupled with the buildup of pct raw materials inventory  partially offset by an increase in trade accounts payable and an increased level of cash collections on outstanding accounts receivable 
net cash used in operations in included the operating loss incurred in  a buildup of inventory  the reversal of non cash interest expense and a decline in accrued expenses  partially offset by the receipt of an income tax refund and an increase in trade accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to  during year the increase of cash used for investing in was due to the purchase of a dna sequencer at the company s biotech subsidiary and the construction of several preproduction pct barocyclers tm as demonstration units 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to cash used of  during in early  the company pledged  via a deposit in an interest bearing account at a financial institution  this was partially offset by repayment to the company of a loan to richard t 
schumacher as discussed further below 
in  the company used proceeds from the sale of certain assets of bbicl to pay off in full the remaining  balance on its line of credit and all remaining outstanding senior subordinated convertible debentures and issued a loan to richard t 
schumacher as discussed in the section entitled related party transaction below 
in april  the company borrowed  net of issuance costs under a mortgage agreement on its west bridgewater  ma facility 
the company used these funds to reduce the outstanding balance on its line of credit 
the mortgage is due on march  during the first five years the note carries an interest rate of  after five years the rate charged will be greater than the bank base rate then in effect 
under this mortgage agreement the company is subject to certain financial covenants 
the company failed to meet its debt service coverage covenant for the year ended december   but the financial institution has waived this default and the company s other defaults relating to reports and the termination of the company s former chairman and chief executive officer 
payments due on this mortgage are based on a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment representing the remaining balance due in full on march  based on current forecasts  management believes that the company has sufficient liquidity to finance operations for the next twelve months 
management s forecasts involve assumptions that could prove to be incorrect 
if the company continues to incur operating losses or negative cash flows  it may need to raise additional funds 
there can be no assurance that these funds will be available when required on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available when needed  the company may be required to further reduce its fixed costs and delay  scale back  or eliminate certain of its activities  any of which could have a material adverse long term effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is considering various sources of additional financing  including but not limited to  sale of business segments  strategic alliances and private placements of debt or equity securities  which could result in dilution to the company s stockholders 
on october   the company retained an investment banking firm to advise the company in the evaluation of strategic opportunities aimed at increasing shareholder value and liquidity by increasing the capital needed for growth 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of the company s future contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years mortgage payments     capital lease and other obligations    real estate facility leases    minimum future royalty payments   obligations relating to discontinued operations   pledge and loan guarantee   total contractual cash obligations    future monthly payments on this mortgage include principal and interest  based on a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment representing the remaining balance due in full on march  during the first five years the note carries an interest rate of  after five years the rate charged will be

the information presented in the table above is presented using an assumed annual mortgage interest rate of for all periods presented 
the company acquired in all the remaining outstanding common stock of bioseq  inc  a development stage company involved with pct 
in accordance with the provisions of a technology transfer agreement assumed in the transaction  the company is obligated to pay a royalty on net sales until march of future sales by any entity of the company utilizing pct  with minimum royalty payments through year the company announced the availability of its pct products for commercial sale in the latter part of year in january  the company made a  pledge and loan guarantee of certain indebtedness of an entity controlled by mr 
schumacher via a deposit of equal amount in an interest bearing account with a financial institution 
this is reflected as restricted cash on the accompanying balance sheet as of december  in january  the  pledged to a financial institution was used to satisfy the company s guaranty obligation to the financial institution 
a description of this transaction is noted above 
related party transaction as of december   the company had entered into a one year loan of  to richard t 
schumacher  the company s former chairman and chief executive officer and a current director of the company  renewable at the company s option  and collateralized by  of mr 
schumacher s shares of the company s common stock 
this loan constituted an increase from the  had been loaned as of september  interest on the loan was payable monthly at the annual rate of but has not been paid to date 
as of december   the loan was shown on the balance sheet as a decrease to stockholders equity 
in january  the principal of these loans was repaid in full with a portion of the proceeds of the loans described in the following sentence 
the company s loans were replaced by the company s pledge of a  interest bearing deposit at a financial institution to secure the company s limited guaranty of loans in the aggregate amount of  from the financial institution to an entity controlled by mr 
schumacher 
the loans are personally guaranteed by mr 
schumacher 
the company s pledge is secured by a junior subordinated interest in the collateral provided by mr 
schumacher to the financial institution 
such collateral includes certain of his real property and all of his common stock holdings in the company 
the company s original loan and subsequent pledge of  were made to assist mr 
schumacher in refinancing indebtedness related to  among other things  his divorce settlement and to enable him to avoid the need to sell his common stock holdings in the company on the open market to satisfy his debts 
the company s board of directors and  with respect to the decision to pledge the  cash collateral  a special committee of the independent directors  evaluated a number of options and concluded that the original loan to mr 
schumacher and the subsequent pledge were the best option and in the best interests of the company s stockholders in the belief that it would  among other things  avoid selling pressure on the company s common stock and relieve the financial pressures on mr 
schumacher that could otherwise divert his attention from the company 
in january  the  account was used to satisfy the company s limited guaranty obligation 
the company has now satisfied its obligation under the limited guaranty and pledge with the financial institution 
the company continues to maintain its junior interest in collateral pledged by mr 
schumacher to the financial institution 
the collateral includes certain of mr 
schumacher s real property and all of his common stockholdings in the company 
the company reflected the  pledge as restricted cash on its balance sheet until the cash was used to satisfy the company s limited guaranty in january and since then has reflected a  loan receivable on its balance sheet 
on february   the company announced that the company s board of directors had terminated richard t 
schumacher as chairman and chief executive officer  effective immediately 
mr 
schumacher remains a director of the company 
william a 
wilson  a director  was named chairman of the board 
kevin w

risk factors this report also contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applicable to all forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
we rely on purchase orders and contracts from a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues  the loss of business from these customers could materially reduce our revenues and income 
purchase orders account for the majority of our orders  none of our customers have contractually committed to make future product purchases from us 
in  our three largest commercial customers  ortho clinical laboratories  inc  roche diagnostics corporation  and abbott laboratories  together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
in addition  the various agencies of the national institutes of health  including the national institutes of allergies and infectious disease  the national cancer institute and the national heart lung and blood institute  in the aggregate  accounted for approximately of our revenues in each agency within the national institutes of health  however  makes independent purchasing decisions 
the loss of any major customer  including any agency within the national institutes of health  the failure of any agency of the national institutes of health to fully fund any contract or renew any contract with us  or a material reduction in any major customer s purchases would materially reduce our revenues and our operating results 
if we are unable to increase our sales of quality control products to end users of infectious disease test kits  then our future revenues could be less than we have projected 
currently  we sell most of our quality control products for infectious disease test kits to test kit manufacturers and regulators  which is a relatively small market 
however  we also sell our quality control products to end users of infectious disease test kits  including hospital laboratories  blood donor testing centers  public health laboratories and commercial laboratories 
this end user market is a larger market which has not yet become accustomed to using quality control products to monitor test results  but which we believe is a growing market 
currently  we expect an increase in both the frequency of use and the number of products used by our current end user customers 
however  these end users of infectious disease test kits may not increase their use of our products 
further  large manufacturers and distributors of quality control products that have historically sold to the non infectious disease market and that have greater financial  manufacturing and marketing resources than we have could begin selling their products to the end users of infectious disease test kits 
this would increase competition for an adequate supply of the rare specimens of plasma and serum necessary for certain of our quality control and run control products 
if the end user market for quality control products for infectious disease testing does not develop further  or if we are unable to increase sales of our products to this market  our future revenues could be substantially less than we have projected 
if our bbi bioseq  inc 
and bbi source scientific  inc 
subsidiaries continue to have substantial operating losses  then we may not be able to realize the book value of their assets 
our bbi bioseq subsidiary has incurred operating losses of approximately  since its acquisition in september through december  this subsidiary may not be successful in marketing and further developing its technology  and its technology may never achieve commercial viability 
accordingly  our bbi bioseq subsidiary may never become profitable and we may need to write off some or all of the current net book value of its intangible assets related to its patents  which was approximately  as of december  as a result of our july acquisition of source scientific  inc  we recorded approximately  of goodwill 
since this acquisition  our bbi source scientific subsidiary has incurred cumulative operating losses of approximately  not including a  write down of goodwill in the third quarter of  as of december  as of december   the remaining net book value of goodwill from the bbi source scientific acquisition was approximately  that subsidiary may continue to have operating losses and may never become profitable 
if operating losses continue  some or all of the remaining goodwill associated with bbi source scientific in the amount of  may be written down or written off entirely 
if we are unable to obtain both the necessary regulatory approvals and substantial funds for our bbi bioseq subsidiary s products  or if demand for new products and services fails to materialize  our future revenues and income will be less than we have projected 
our bbi bioseq subsidiary  in conjunction with our other subsidiaries has developed products that involved significant development  preclinical and clinical testing  regulatory approvals and investment of substantial funds prior to their commercialization 
our bbi bioseq subsidiary and bbi source scientific subsidiary have developed a pressure cycling technology process into a working laboratory instrument now available for commercial sale 
we first introduced our barocycler instrument and related disposable pulse tubes based upon pressure cycling technology for commercial sale in september demand for these commercial applications of pressure cycling technology may not materialize as expected 
as a result  we may not be successful in selling the barocycler instrument and disposable pulse tubes in sufficient numbers to be commercially viable 
in addition  we may not be successful in further developing pressure cycling technology into other commercially viable products and services  or such activities may take longer than currently expected  and if successful in such development activities  demand for such products and services may not develop as we anticipate 
while we have nine issued us patents relating to pressure cycling technology  certain pressure cycling technology applications may not fall within the claims of those issued patents 
further  individuals and groups utilizing present cycling technology may not be required to license such technology from us 
further  our future revenues and income could be less than we have projected 
if the fda requires clearance or approval for either our products that are designated only for research and not for diagnostic procedures or our products that we believe are exempt from fda clearance and initiates enforcement action for our failure to do so  we will likely expend significant resources to resolve the matter 
in the united states  the food  drug  and cosmetic act prohibits the marketing of most in vitro diagnostic products until the food and drug administration either clears or approves the products through processes that are time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
some in vitro diagnostic products may be exempt from fda clearance or approval if they have undergone validation studies 
as of february   of our accurun r and accurun r products had received fda clearance 
during  our accurun r external run controls products accounted for approximately of our revenue 
although it has not done so in the past  the fda may not agree that some of these products are entitled to an exemption and may adopt a different interpretation of the food  drug  and cosmetic act or other laws it administers 
we believe that products which are used only for research and not in diagnostic procedures are not subject to fda clearance or approval 
we currently label some of our products for research use only because they are not intended for use in diagnostic procedures  and have not been cleared or approved by the fda 
it is possible  however  that some purchasers of these products may use them for diagnostic purposes rather than for research  despite our labeling 
under any of these circumstances  the fda could allege that some or all of these products should have been cleared or approved  or otherwise validated prior to marketing  and could initiate enforcement action against us 
if the fda initiates enforcement action against us  we will likely expend a large amount of time  money  resources and management attention to resolve the matter 
in addition  if we cannot obtain or are delayed in obtaining fda clearances or approvals for our products  we may encounter delays or be unable to ever sell those products 
if we fail to comply with good manufacturing practices in connection with the manufacture of our medical device products  we may not be able to distribute our products and may not generate product revenues 
we are also subject to strict fda good manufacturing practice regulations which govern testing  control and documentation practices  and other post marketing restrictions on the manufacture of our medical device products 
our in vitro diagnostic products and our laboratory instrumentation products are considered medical device products  as defined by the fda 
regulatory authorities monitor our ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practices and other applicable regulatory requirements through periodic inspections 
if we fail to comply with good manufacturing practices or other regulatory requirements  we may not be able to obtain future pre market clearances or approvals  or the fda or other regulatory agencies may impose corrective action requirements  including total or partial suspension of product distribution  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  and criminal prosecution 
any of these events would lead to increased costs and a drain on resources and could reduce our revenues and operating results 
because we conduct our business worldwide  changes in international regulatory requirements may materially reduce our total revenues 
our international sales accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the year ended december  several accurun r external run controls products are subject to international regulatory approvals in germany and france 
as of february  seven of the company s accurun r positive control products designed for the european market have been approved to ce mark by g med  a designated notified body under the european union s in vitro diagnostics directive 
the ivd directive describes criteria that must be met and steps that must be taken for in vitro diagnostic products to be qualified for sale in european union countries beginning at the end of in the ivd directive  the european union classifies products according to the risks associated with their failure or misuse  and establishes a process leading to ce mark approval to sell a product in eu countries for each category 
our accurun r product line is in the highest risk category because these products are intended for use with tests for hiv and hepatitis b and c  thus the criteria for approval to ce mark are the most stringent  and require notified body review 
these international approval processes are similar to the fda clearance process and good manufacturing practice regulations 
changes in international regulatory requirements and policies  including both changes in existing restrictions and future restrictions on importation of blood and blood derivatives  could result in reduced international sales  which may materially reduce our total revenues and income 
if we are unable to obtain a steady and adequate supply of rare specimens of plasma and serum  then we may be unable to produce our quality control panel products and our accurun external run controls products 
we manufacture our diagnostic products  including our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products  from human plasma and serum which we obtain from nonprofit and commercial blood centers in the united states and from similar sources throughout the world 
our bbi diagnostics business unit  which manufactures and sells these diagnostic products  accounts for approximately of our revenues 
our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products contain rare plasma specimens that we collect from individuals who have been infected with particular diseases 
the specimens are rare because we can collect them only during the brief period of time when the markers for a particular disease in an infected individual are converting from negative to positive 
it is difficult to identify such infected individuals and to collect specimens from them during the brief period of time when the markers for a particular disease are converting from negative to positive 
as a result  quantities of these specimens are limited 
as we sell our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products  we must find replacement specimens that are equally rare 
we may also face competition to obtain these specimens which could further limit our ability to obtain the specimens and to produce our quality control panel products and accurun external run controls products 
a limit in our ability to produce our products would reduce our future revenues and operating results 
if we are not able to react quickly to technological change  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the infectious disease test kit industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change  and changes in customer requirements 
as a result  our ability to continue to compete effectively in this industry depends upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to develop or acquire  and introduce in a timely manner  new products that take advantage of technological advances and respond to customer requirements 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing such new products or enhancements to our existing products on a timely basis  if at all  and such products may not adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
furthermore  rapid technological development may result in our products or services becoming obsolete or noncompetitive before we recover our investment in research  development and commercialization 
if we cannot protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to compete effectively 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and products 
we rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets and non disclosure and confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products 
for the pressure cycling technology developed by our bbi bioseq subsidiary  we have nine issued patents and several other patents pending 
if we have not adequately protected our technology  or if our competitors misappropriate our intellectual property  we could lose market share and our future revenues and operating income could be significantly less than projected 
if we are unable to attract and retain a new chief executive officer  then we may not be successful in fully executing our business plan 
on february   we announced the termination of our chairman and chief executive officer 
we subsequently appointed as chairman mr 
william a 
wilson  an existing independent member of the board of directors 
a special committee of our board of directors has been appointed to oversee management of the affairs of the company until such time as a new chief executive officer is employed 
there are a limited number of qualified candidates for the position with the necessary technical background and management experience 
we are competing for those candidates with companies that are larger and have greater financial resources than we 
if we are not able to attract and retain a new  suitably qualified  chief executive officer within a reasonable period of time  we may not be able to properly evaluate our strategic choices  our existing management may not be able to focus their attention on all necessary management matters and we may not be successful in fully executing our business plan 
if we are unable to attract and retain highly qualified scientific and management personnel  then we may not be able to develop and refine our products and services 
our products and services are highly technical and our key personnel must have specialized training or advanced degrees in order to develop and refine these products and services 
there are a limited number of qualified scientific and management personnel who possess the technical background necessary to adequately understand and improve our products and services 
we compete for these personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations engaged in research and development of products similar to ours 
if we are unable to attract and retain scientific and management personnel with the appropriate credentials who are capable of developing and refining our products and services  then our products and services could become inaccurate or unreliable  or could fail to obtain fda approval and we may be unable to deliver new products 
we may not be able to fully collect the principal and interest due on a  receivable from our former chairman and chief executive officer 
as of january  we recorded a  receivable from our former chairman and chief executive officer  richard t 
schumacher 
we continue to maintain a junior security interest in collateral pledged by mr 
schumacher to a financial institution 
the collateral includes certain of mr 
schumacher s real property and all of his shares of our common stock 
the collateral and personal assets of mr 
schumacher may not be sufficient to permit us to fully recover the principal  interest and other costs associated with this receivable 
if the value of the collateral decreases  we may have to write down or write off the receivable 
therefore  we cannot be certain that we will collect the full amount of the receivable 
a few stockholders control a significant percentage of voting power and may exercise their voting power in a manner adverse to other stockholders interests 
our former chairman and chief executive officer  richard t 
schumacher  and our other existing officers and directors collectively have voting control over approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of february in addition  approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of february were controlled by mr
