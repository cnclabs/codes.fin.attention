item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following pages of this report present management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of susquehanna bancshares  inc and its subsidiaries 
susquehanna bancshares  inc and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as susquehanna  we  us  and our 
certain statements in this document may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the us private securities litigation reform act of  such as statements that include the words expect  estimate  project  anticipate  should  intend  probability  risk  target  objective  and similar expressions or variations 
table of contents on such expressions 
in particular  this document includes forward looking statements relating  but not limited to  susquehanna s potential exposures to various types of market risks  such as interest rate risk and credit risk 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties 
for example  certain of the market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  actual income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by the forward looking statements contained in this document include  but are not limited to adverse changes in our loan and lease portfolios and the resulting credit risk related losses and expenses  interest rate fluctuations which could increase our cost of funds or decrease our yield on earning assets and therefore reduce our net interest income  continued levels of our loan quality and origination volume  the adequacy of loss reserves  the loss of certain key officers which could adversely impact our business  continued relationships with major customers  the inability to continue to grow our business internally and through acquisition and successful integration of bank and non bank entities while controlling our costs  adverse national and regional economic and business conditions  compliance with laws and regulatory requirements of federal and state agencies  competition from other financial institutions in originating loans  attracting deposits  and providing various financial services that may affect our profitability  the inability to hedge certain risks economically  our ability to effectively implement technology driven products and services  changes in consumer confidence  spending  and savings habits relative to the bank and non bank financial services we provide  and our success in managing the risks involved in the foregoing 
we encourage readers of this report to understand forward looking statements to be strategic objectives rather than absolute targets of future performance 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made 
we do not update forward looking statements to reflect circumstances or events that occur after the date the forward looking statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
the following discussion and analysis  the purpose of which is to provide investors and others with information that we believe to be necessary for an understanding of susquehanna s financial condition  changes in financial condition  and results of operations  should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes  and other information contained in this document 
results of operations summary of compared to an integral part of our strategic plan involved improving our core banking performance 
with a focused effort on training our employees  our sales culture has achieved substantial results 
net income for the year ended december   increased million  or  over net income of million 
our earnings performance continues to be enhanced by significant improvements in non interest income  which  during the year  exceeded of total revenues 
the million improvement in non interest income over the year ended december   was split almost equally between banking affiliate operations and non bank affiliate operations 
diluted earnings per share increased from per share for the year ended to per share for the year ended as a result of our adoption of sfas no

our major source of operating revenues is net interest income  which rose to a level of million in  million  or  above the million attained in net interest income increased in despite the substantial decline in the levels of total interest income  which was more than offset by a decline in total interest expense 
net interest income as a percentage of net interest income and other income was   and for the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents net interest income is the income that remains after deducting  from total income generated by earning assets  the interest expense attributable to the acquisition of the funds required to support earning assets 
income from earning assets includes income from loans  income from investment securities  and income from short term investments 
the amount of interest income is dependent upon many factors including the volume of earning assets  the general level of interest rates  the dynamics of the change in interest rates  and the levels of non performing loans 
the cost of funds varies with the amount of funds necessary to support earning assets  the rates paid to attract and hold deposits  the rates paid on borrowed funds  and the levels of non interest bearing demand deposits and equity capital 
table presents average balances  taxable equivalent interest income and expenses  and yields earned or paid on these assets and liabilities 
for purposes of calculating taxable equivalent interest income  tax exempt interest has been adjusted using a marginal tax rate of in order to equate the yield to that of taxable interest rates

as shown in table  the increase in our net interest income in compared with was primarily attributable to increased volumes in interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets grew by million in over  while interest bearing liabilities grew by million for the same time period 
the growth in average interest earning assets was due to a 
table of contents million increase in average loans and leases and a million increase in our average investment portfolio  offset by a decrease of million in average short term investments 
the net increase in average interest bearing liabilities was attributable to growth in interest bearing deposits of million and growth in average short term federal home loan bank fhlb and long term borrowings totaling million  offset by a decline in average vehicle financing of million 
decreases in both interest income and interest expense are attributable to lower prevailing rates and yields throughout as compared to as illustrated in table  the tax equivalent yield on earning assets for decreased to from in  while the average cost of funds decreased from in to in also contributing to the improvement in the net interest margin was an increase in average non interest bearing demand deposits of million for as compared to as a result of the preceding factors  our net interest margin  on a taxable equivalent basis  increased from in to in variances do occur in the net interest margin  as an exact repricing of assets and liabilities is not possible

provision and allowance for loan and lease losses 
the provision for loan and lease losses is the expense necessary to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at a level adequate to absorb management s estimate of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
our provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio 
the purpose of the review is to assess loan quality  identify impaired loans  analyze delinquencies  ascertain loan growth  evaluate potential charge offs and recoveries  and assess general economic conditions in the markets we serve 
commercial and real estate loans are internally risk rated by our loan officers and periodically reviewed by loan quality personnel 
consumer loans  residential real estate loans  and leases are generally analyzed in the aggregate as they are of relatively small dollar size and homogeneous in nature 

table of contents key factors in determining the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses are current economic conditions  loan portfolio diversification  delinquency and historic loss experience  and results of examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
to determine the allowance and the corresponding charge to the loan and lease loss provision  the amount required for specific loans is first determined 
for certain commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans  this amount is based upon specific borrower data determined by reviewing individual non performing  delinquent  or potentially troubled credits 
the remaining commercial and commercial real estate loans as well as consumer  residential real estate  and lease allowances  which may include specific reserves  generally are based upon recent charge off and delinquency history  other known trends  and expected losses over the remaining lives of these loans  as well as the condition of local  regional  and national economies 
in addition  a reserve for unused commitments is determined using the same criteria applied to the remaining commercial portfolio by risk rating type 
determining the level of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses at any given period is difficult  particularly during deteriorating or uncertain economic periods 
we must make estimates using information and assumptions that are often subjective and changing rapidly 
the review of the loan and lease portfolios is a continuing event in light of a changing economy and the dynamics of the banking and regulatory environment 
in our opinion  the allowance for loan and lease losses is adequate to meet probable future loan and lease losses at december  there can be no assurance  however  that we will not sustain losses in future periods  which could be greater than the size of the allowance at december  as illustrated in table  the provision for loan and lease losses was million for compared to million in this million increase in the provision is the result of the continued growth in our loan portfolio from billion at december   to billion at december   and charge offs in our equipment leasing subsidiary s truck portfolio due to adverse market conditions 
net charge offs  as presented in table  were million in compared with million in the allowance for loan and lease losses at december   was of period end loans and leases  or million  compared with  or million  at december  table provision and allowance for loan and lease losses dollars in thousands allowance for loan and lease losses  january allowance acquired in business combination allowance transferred to third party guarantor additions to provision for loan and lease losses charged to operations loans and leases charged off during the year commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction real estate secured residential real estate secured commercial consumer leases total charge offs recoveries of loans and leases previously charged off commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction real estate secured residential real estate secured commercial consumer leases total recoveries net charge offs allowance for loan and lease losses  december average loans and leases outstanding period end loans and leases net charge offs as a percentage of average loans and leases allowance as a percentage of period end loans and leases 
table of contents should the economic climate deteriorate further  borrowers may experience increased difficulty  and the level of non performing loans and assets  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the level of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
they may require additions to allowances based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of examination 
it is our policy not to renegotiate the terms of a commercial loan simply because of a delinquency status 
rather  a commercial loan is typically transferred to non accrual status if it is not well secured and in the process of collection  and is considered delinquent in payment if either principal or interest is past due days or more 
interest income received on non performing commercial loans in and was million and million  respectively 
interest income that would have been recorded on these loans under the original terms was million and million for and  respectively 
at december   we had no outstanding commitments to advance additional funds with respect to these non performing loans 
consumer loans are typically charged off at days past due unless they are secured by real estate 
loans secured by real estate are evaluated on the basis of collateral value 
loans that are well secured may continue to accrue interest while other loans are charged down to net realizable value or placed on non accrual depending upon their loan to value ratio 
table is an analysis of the provision levels as well as the activity in the allowance for loan and lease losses for the past five years 
table reflects the five year history of non performing assets and loans and leases contractually past due days and still accruing 
total non performing assets at december  and  were million and million  respectively  including million and million  respectively  in other real estate acquired through foreclosure 
non performing assets as a percentage of period end loans and leases and other real estate owned was at december   a slight increase from at december  real estate acquired through foreclosure is carried at its fair value  which is calculated as the lower of the recorded amount of the loan for which the foreclosed property served as collateral  or the fair market value of the property as determined by a current appraisal less estimated costs to sell 
prior to foreclosure  the recorded amount of the loan is written down  if necessary  to fair value by charging the allowance for loan and lease losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  gains or losses on the sale of real estate acquired through foreclosure are recorded in operating income  and any losses determined as a result of periodic valuations are charged to other operating expense 
table non performing assets dollars in thousands at december loans contractually past due days and still accruing non performing assets nonaccrual assets commercial  financial  and agricultural real estate construction real estate secured residential real estate secured commercial consumer leases restructured loans other real estate owned total non performing assets total non performing assets as a percentage of period end loans and leases and other real estate owned allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of non performing loans loans with principal and or interest delinquent days or more and still accruing interest were million at december   a decrease from the million at december  a softening of certain segments of the economy may adversely affect certain borrowers and may cause additional loans to become past due beyond days or be placed on non accrual status because of uncertainty of receiving full payment of either principal or interest on these loans 

table of contents potential problem loans consist of loans that are performing under contract but for which potential credit problems have caused us to place them on our internally monitored loan list 
such loans  which are not included in table  amounted to million at december   and million at december  depending upon the state of the economy and the impact thereon to these borrowers  as well as future events such as regulatory examination assessments  these loans and others not currently so identified could be classified as non performing assets in the future 
other income 
non interest income  recorded as other income  consists of service charges on deposit accounts  commissions and fees received for credit cards merchant processing  asset management fees  fees for trust services  vehicle origination and servicing fees  income generated from bank owned life insurance and reinsurance activities  commissions and fees on casualty and property insurance  net gains and losses on security transactions  net gains on sales of loans  and other miscellaneous income  such as travelers checks and money order sales  safe deposit box rents  and net gains on the sale of other real estate and branch offices 
other income  as a percentage of net interest income and other income  was   and for   and  respectively 
non interest income increased million  or  in over service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  in over in response to the increase in demand deposits during the same time period 
the acquisition of the addis group  inc  completed in june  contributed million to non interest income in the form of commissions and fees on property and casualty insurance 
vehicle origination and servicing fees rose million primarily as a result of increases in the amount charged for origination fees 
also contributing to the increase in other operating income was a million security gain generated from the sale of our entire corporate bond portfolio to reduce credit risk and a million security gain during the fourth quarter of resulting from the sale of a small cap bank stock which we no longer had a strategic interest in holding 
in september  we exited the merchant credit card business to reduce our risk relating to the travel industry 
this resulted in a decrease in merchant credit card fees of million for the year ended december  gain on sale of loans and leases was million in compared with million in during  hann sold approximately million in automobile leases and realized a net  pre tax gain of million 
during  hann sold approximately million in automobile leases and also realized a net  pre tax gain of million 
during  our bank subsidiaries sold approximately million of mortgage loans that were originated for sale 
in conjunction with the sale of these mortgage loans  we realized approximately million in gains 
during  our bank subsidiaries sold approximately million of mortgage loans  which resulted in a gain of million 
other expenses 
non interest expenses are categorized into the following nine groupings employee related expenses  which includes salaries  fringe benefits  and employment taxes  occupancy expenses  which includes depreciation  rents  maintenance  utilities  and insurance  furniture and equipment expense  which includes depreciation  rents and maintenance  amortization of intangible assets  vehicle residual value expense  vehicle delivery and preparation expense  merchant credit card servicing expense  restructuring charges  and other expenses detailed in table incurred in the operation of our business 
non interest expense increased million  or  in over salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expense  increased million  or  from to the increase in salaries and benefits was primarily due to normal annual salary increases  recent branch openings  new revenue producing positions  and higher pension costs 
salaries and benefits for the addis group  inc  which was acquired in june  accounted for million of the total increase 
charges for occupancy increased million  or  in from  due to recent branch openings 
amortization of intangible assets declined million in from in accordance with our adoption of sfas no 
on january   and the resulting cessation of goodwill amortization 

table of contents vehicle residual value expense in increased million from due to the required payment under the servicing agreement with auto lenders liquidation center  inc a further explanation of this agreement is found in the section titled financial condition related party transaction and residual value risk 
vehicle delivery and preparation expense for increased million over the prior year s expense due to hann s increased ability to remarket automobiles through retail channels rather than through wholesale auctions during  as well as increased volume 
our exiting of the merchant credit card business in september resulted in a decrease in merchant credit card servicing expense of million for the year ended december   as compared to all other expenses increased million see table  with the most notable increase  million  in advertising  marketing  and public relations expense 
table analysis of other expenses dollars in thousands year ended december advertising  marketing  and public relations audits and examinations communications directors fees legal and professional life insurance company related expenses other real estate outside services pa shares capital stock tax postage and delivery software amortization and maintenance stationery and supplies fdic insurance all other total income taxes 
our effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the effective rate for was decreased primarily as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   and the accompanying cessation of goodwill amortization 
the reduction in pre tax amortization expense of approximately million in had a favorable impact on our effective tax rate  as most of the amortization expense was not deductible for income tax purpose 
offsetting the impact of reduced amortization expense in was a reduced level of tax advantaged income 
as tax advantaged loans and securities continue to mature  the opportunities for investment in additional tax advantaged enterprises have become less attractive due to certain provisions of the tax reform act of financial condition summary of compared to total assets at december   were billion  an increase of  as compared to total assets of billion at december  loans increased to billion at december   from billion at december   while deposits increased to billion from billion during the same time period 
we believe that these increases are a direct result of our bank subsidiaries successful implementation of our retail and corporate sales initiatives throughout equity capital was million at december   or per share  compared to million  or per share  at december  
table of contents investment securities 
we follow sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
this accounting pronouncement requires the segregation of investment securities into three categories  each having a distinct accounting treatment held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
securities identified as held to maturity continue to be carried at their amortized cost and  except for limited circumstances  may not be sold prior to maturity 
securities identified as available for sale must be reported at their market or fair value  and the difference between that value and their amortized cost recorded in the equity section  net of taxes 
as a result  our total equity was positively impacted by million as the unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  for available for sale securities increased from million at december   to million at december  securities identified as trading account securities are marked to market with the change recorded in the income statement 
presently  we do not engage in trading activity  but we do engage in active portfolio management  which requires the majority of our security portfolios to be identified as available for sale 
while sfas no 
requires segregation into held to maturity and available for sale categories see table  it does not change our policy concerning the purchase of only high quality securities 
strategies employed address liquidity  capital adequacy  and net interest margin considerations  which then determine the assignment of purchases into these two categories 
table illustrates the maturities of these security portfolios and the weighted average yields based upon amortized costs 
yields are shown on a tax equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate 
at december   we held no securities of one issuer  other than us government obligations  where the aggregate book value exceeded of shareholders equity 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as of january  concurrent with adoption of this standard  and as permitted by its provisions  approximately million of securities held to maturity were reclassified as securities available for sale 
this reclassification resulted in an after tax gain in of approximately million  which was recorded in other comprehensive income

table presents the loans outstanding  by type of loan  in our portfolio for the past five years 
in  residential mortgage loans increased million  real estate secured commercial loans increased million  commercial loans increased million  and construction loans grew by million compared to consumer loans increased million in from we believe that the growth that occurred in our loan portfolio in was accomplished through our sales and marketing efforts 
we remain committed  however  to maintaining credit quality and doing business in our market area with customers we know 
our bank subsidiaries have historically reported a significant amount of loans secured by real estate  as depicted in table many of these loans have real estate collateral taken as additional security not related to the acquisition of the real estate pledged 
open end home equity loans amounted to million at december   and an additional million was lent against junior liens on residential properties at december  senior liens on family residential properties totaled million at december   and much of the million in loans secured by non farm  non residential properties represented collateralization of operating lines  or term loans that finance equipment  inventory  or receivables 
loans secured by farmland totaled million  while loans secured by multi family residential properties totaled million at december  leases declined by million in compared to  as most of hann s new lease production in was either sold or originated for other institutions

our deposit base is consumer oriented  consisting of time deposits  primarily certificates of deposit of various terms  interest bearing demand accounts  savings accounts  and demand deposits 
the average amounts of deposits by type are summarized in table we do not rely upon time deposits of  or more as a principal source of funds as they represent only of total deposits

the notes rank equally with our other subordinated indebtedness and are junior to our senior indebtedness 
we have used million of the net proceeds of the offering to repay long term senior indebtedness that matured in february we expect to repay an additional million in senior indebtedness that will mature in july the remainder will be used for general corporate purposes 
in accordance with regulatory guidelines  the notes qualify as tier capital 
market risks 
the types of market risk exposures generally faced by banking entities include equity market price risk  liquidity risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  and commodity price risk 
due to the nature of our operations  foreign currency and commodity price risk are not significant to us 
equity market price risk is the risk related to market fluctuations of equity prices in the securities markets 
while we do not have significant risk in our investment portfolio  market price fluctuations may affect fee income generated through our asset management operations 
generally  our fee structure is based on the market value of assets being managed at specific time frames 
if market values decline  our fee income may also decline 
liquidity and interest rate risk are related but distinctly different from one another 
the maintenance of adequate liquidity the ability to meet the cash requirements of our customers and other financial commitments is a fundamental aspect of our asset liability management strategy 
our policy of diversifying our funding sources purchased funds  repurchase agreements  and deposit accounts allows us to avoid undue concentration in any single financial market and also to avoid heavy funding requirements within short periods of time 
at december   our bank subsidiaries had unused lines of credit available to them from various fhlbs of million 
however  liquidity is not entirely dependent on increasing our liability balances 
liquidity can also be generated from maturing or readily marketable assets 
the carrying value of investment securities maturing within one year amounted to million at december  these maturing investments represented of total available for sale investment 
table of contents securities 
cash and due from banks amounted to million and unrestricted short term investments amounted to million for the year ended december   both of which represent additional sources of liquidity 
closely related to the management of liquidity is the management of interest rate risk 
interest rate risk focuses on maintaining stability in the net interest margin  an important factor in earnings growth 
interest rate sensitivity is the matching or mismatching of the maturity and rate structure of the interest bearing assets and liabilities 
it is our objective to control the difference in the timing of the rate changes for these assets and liabilities to preserve a satisfactory net interest margin 
in doing so  we endeavor to maximize earnings in an environment of changing interest rates 
there is  however  a lag in maintaining the desired matching because the repricing of products occurs at varying time intervals 
we employ a variety of methods to monitor interest rate risk 
by dividing assets and liabilities into three groups fixed rate  floating rate  and those which reprice only at our discretion strategies are developed which are designed to minimize exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we also utilize gap analysis to evaluate rate sensitivity at a given point in time 
table illustrates our estimated interest rate sensitivity and periodic and cumulative gap positions as calculated at december  and these estimates include anticipated paydowns on commercial and residential loans  mortgage backed securities  and certain assumptions regarding core deposits 
traditionally  an institution with more assets table balance sheet gap analysis dollars in thousands at december  months months years over years total assets short term investments investments loans and leases  net of unearned income total liabilities interest bearing demand savings time time in denominations of or more total borrowings total interest sensitivity gap periodic cumulative cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets at december  months months years over years total assets short term investments investments loans and leases  net of unearned income total liabilities interest bearing demand savings time time in denominations of or more total borrowings total interest sensitivity gap periodic cumulative cumulative gap as a percentage of earning assets 
table of contents repricing than liabilities over a given time frame is considered asset sensitive  and one with more liabilities repricing than assets is considered liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive institution will generally benefit from rising rates  and a liability sensitive institution will generally benefit from declining rates 
however  imbedded options  such as a call feature on a bond or a prepayment option on a loan  may impact the magnitude and direction of interest rate sensitivity 
in addition to periodic gap reports comparing the sensitivity of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in interest rates  we also utilize an in house simulation model that measures our exposure to interest rate risk 
this model calculates the income effect and the economic value of assets  liabilities  and equity at current and forecasted interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates at one percent intervals 
the income effect and economic value of defined categories of financial instruments is calculated by the model using estimated cash flows based on imbedded options  prepayments  early withdrawals  and weighted average contractual rates and terms 
for economic value calculations  the model also considers discount rates for similar financial instruments 
the economic value of longer term fixed rate financial instruments is generally more sensitive to changes in interest rates 
adjustable rate and variable rate financial instruments largely reflect only a change in economic value representing the difference between the contractual and discounted rates until the next contractual interest rate repricing date  unless subject to rate caps and floors 
a substantial portion of our loans consists of commercial and residential mortgage loans containing significant imbedded options  which permit the borrower to repay the principal balance of the loan prior to maturity prepayments without penalty 
a loan s susceptibility for prepayment is dependent upon a number of factors  including the current interest rate versus the contractual interest rate of the loan  the financial ability of the borrower to refinance  the economic benefit  and the availability of refinancing at attractive terms 
refinancing may also depend upon economic and other factors in specific geographic areas that affect the sales and price levels of residential property 
in a changing interest rate environment  prepayments may increase or decrease depending on the current relative levels and expectations of future short term and long term interest rates 
since a significant portion of our loan portfolio has adjustable or variable rates  prepayments on such loans generally increase when long term interest rates fall or are at historically low levels relative to short term interest rates and fixed rate loans are economically more desirable 
investment securities  other than those with early call provisions and mortgage backed securities  generally do not have significant imbedded options and repay pursuant to specific terms until maturity 
while savings and checking deposits generally may be withdrawn upon the customer s request without prior notice  a continuing relationship with customers resulting in future deposits and withdrawals is generally predictable  resulting in a dependable source of funds 
time deposits generally have early withdrawal penalties  while term fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes have prepayment penalties which discourage customer withdrawal of time deposits and prepayment of fhlb borrowings and subordinated notes prior to maturity 
our loans are primarily indexed to national interest rate indices 
when such loans are funded by interest bearing liabilities which are determined by other indices  primarily deposits and fhlb borrowings  a changing interest rate environment may result in different levels of changes in the different indices  resulting in disproportionate changes in the value of  and the net earnings generated from  such financial instruments 
each index is unique and is influenced by different external factors  therefore  the historical relationships in various indices may not be indicative of the actual change  which may result in a changing interest rate environment 
tables and reflect the estimated income effect and economic value of assets  liabilities  and equity calculated using certain assumptions we determined as of december  and  at current interest rates and at hypothetical higher and lower interest rates in one and two percent increments 
as noted in table  the economic value of equity at risk as of december   is five percent  at an interest rate change of minus one percent  while table discloses that net interest income at risk as of december   is four percent  at an interest rate change of minus one percent 
the minus two percent scenario is considered highly unlikely as the current federal funds rate is only 
at december   we were an asset sensitive institution  we should benefit from a rise in interest rates in  if that should occur

table of contents securitizations and off balance sheet vehicle lease financings 
background 
asset securitizations and other off balance sheet financings can affect liquidity and interest rate risk 
hann holds the undivided beneficial interest in hann auto trust  a delaware statutory trust the origination trust  formed by hann in for the purpose of originating automobile leases and holding title to the related vehicles 
automobile leases originated by the origination trust are financed primarily in four ways securitization transactions  sale leaseback transactions  agency arrangements with  and lease sales to  other financial institutions  and other sources of funds  including internally generated sources 
assets financed through the use of the first three methods generally are not reflected on susquehanna s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december  and  respectively  hann s off balance sheet  managed portfolio was funded in the following manner dollars in thousands as of december  as of december  securitization transactions sale leaseback transactions agency arrangements and lease sales in comparison  as of december   and december   hann s on balance sheet  managed portfolio totaled million and million  respectively 
all of hann s securitizations and off balance sheet financings primarily are done to fund the assets originated by the origination trust and  in some cases  to enable susquehanna to more efficiently utilize its required regulatory capital 
securitization transactions 
in connection with its securitization transactions  hann sells beneficial interests in automobile leases and related vehicles originated by the origination trust at par to a wholly owned  qualified special purpose entity each a qspe 
these transactions are accounted for as sales under the guidelines of sfas no 
each qspe retains the right to receive excess cash flows from the sold portfolio 
under sfas no 
 hann is required to recognize a receivable representing the present value of these excess cash flows each a pv receivable  which is subordinate to the rights of each qspe s creditors 
the value of this recorded pv receivable is subject to credit  prepayment  and interest rate risk 
further  although neither hann nor susquehanna has retained residual value risk in the automobile leases and related vehicles  in the event of a breach by auto lenders  the residual value guarantor  a qspe may suffer residual losses which would decrease the value of the pv receivable recognized by hann

michael j 
wimmer chairman of the board of directors of hann and a former member of the susquehanna board of directors owns of the outstanding equity interest of auto lenders 
the relationship between mr 
wimmer and auto lenders is described in more detail in related party transaction and residual risk herein 
as of december   the aggregate amount of all such recorded pv receivables in connection with hann securitizations was million 
during the first quarter of  hann entered into a revolving securitization transaction the first quarter transaction and  as of december   had sold beneficial interests in million in automobile leases and related vehicles at par to a wholly owned qspe 
from time to time  this qspe may purchase beneficial interests in additional automobile leases and related vehicles from hann 
the qspe finances such purchases by borrowing funds in an amount up to million from a non related  asset backed commercial paper issuer  the lender  under a committed facility subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions to additional loans 
hann continues to act as servicer for the sold portfolio and receives a servicing fee based upon a percentage of the dollar amount of assets serviced 
the first quarter transaction is accounted for as a sale under the guidelines of sfas no 
neither hann nor susquehanna provide recourse in the first quarter transaction for credit losses 
however  susquehanna has reimbursement obligations to the lender under a letter of credit in an amount up to million if auto lenders breaches its obligations under the first quarter transaction to purchase leased vehicles at the scheduled termination or expiration of the leases for the full stated residual value of the vehicles 
during the third quarter of  hann entered into a revolving securitization transaction the third quarter transaction and  as of december   had sold beneficial interests in million in automobile leases and related vehicles at par to a wholly owned qspe 
from time to time  the qspe may purchase beneficial interests in additional automobile leases and related vehicles from hann 
the qspe finances the purchases by borrowing funds in an amount up to million from a non related  asset backed commercial paper issuer a lender  however  the lender is not committed to make loans to the qspe 
hann continues to act as servicer for the sold portfolio and receives a servicing fee based upon a percentage of the dollar amount of assets serviced 
the third quarter transaction is accounted for as a sale under the guidelines of sfas no 
neither hann nor susquehanna provide recourse for credit losses 
however  the qspe s obligation to pay hann the servicing fee each month is subordinate to the qspe s obligation to pay interest  principal  and fees due on the loans 
therefore  if the qspe suffers credit losses on its assets  it may have insufficient funds to pay the servicing fee to hann 
additionally  if an early amortization event occurs under the qspe s loan agreement  hann  as servicer  will not receive payments of the servicing fee until all interest  principal  and fees due on the loans have been paid although the servicing fee will continue to accrue 
the debt issued in the first quarter transaction and the third quarter transaction bears a floating rate of interest 
in the first quarter transaction  the lender may enter into an interest rate hedge agreement at the expense of the qspe if the amount on deposit in a yield supplement account is less than a targeted balance  which takes into account the current market swap rate 
in the third quarter transaction  the qspe is required to obtain an interest rate hedge agreement if the weighted average fixed interest rate of its assets is less than a targeted portfolio yield calculated monthly 
neither hann nor susquehanna has any obligation to obtain such a hedge agreement for the qspe  but the failure of the qspe to 
table of contents obtain a required hedge agreement would be an event of default under its loan documents 
the transaction documents for the first quarter transaction and the third quarter transaction contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences  including events of default which become applicable upon  among other conditions  the failure of the sold portfolio to meet certain performance tests 
each transaction also provides that any assets that fail to meet the eligibility requirements set forth in each transaction must be repurchased by hann and reallocated to hann s beneficial interest in the origination trust 
further  with respect to the first quarter transaction  the occurrence of certain negative events not directly related to the qspe such as the imposition of a tax or erisa lien on hann s assets  the entry of a large uninsured judgment against hann  or the bankruptcy of hann  auto lenders  or susquehanna will be an event of default under the related loan agreement 
the pv receivable for the first quarter transaction was initially million  and the amount of this pv receivable at december   was million 
the pv receivable for the third quarter transaction was initially million  and the amount of this pv receivable at december   was million 
the aggregate amount of all pv receivables for all securitization transactions at december   was million 
the aggregate amount of all pv receivables for all securitization transactions at december   was million 
agency agreements and lease sales 
agency arrangements and lease sales generally occur on economic terms similar to vehicle lease terms and generally result in no accounting gain or losses to hann and no retention of credit  residual value  or interest rate risk with respect to the sold assets 
agency arrangements involve the origination and servicing by hann of automobile leases for other financial institutions  and lease sales involve the sale of previously originated leases with servicing retained to other financial institutions 
hann generally is entitled to receive all of the administrative fees collected from obligors  a servicing fee  and  in the case of agency arrangements  an origination fee per lease 
lease sales are generally accounted as sales under sfas no 
during the second quarter of  hann entered into a new agency arrangement 
in connection with that arrangement  susquehanna entered into a residual interest agreement under which it guarantees auto lenders performance of its obligations to the new agency client 
auto lenders has agreed to purchase leased vehicles in the agency client s portfolio at the termination of the leases for the full residual value of those vehicles 
in the event the agency client incurs any losses  costs  or expenses as a result of any failure of auto lenders to perform this purchase obligation  susquehanna will compensate the agency client for any final liquidation losses with respect to such leased vehicle 
however  susquehanna s liability is limited to of the maximum aggregate residual value of all leases purchased by the agency client 
at december   the total residual value of the vehicles in the portfolio for this transaction was million  and our maximum obligation under the residual interest agreement at december   was million 
summary of prior years transactions 
in  hann entered into one asset securitization transaction 
the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences  including events of default which become applicable upon  among other conditions  the failure of the sold and pledged portfolios to meet certain performance tests 
the qspe generally retains the right to receive excess cash flows from the sold portfolio and  under sfas no 
 hann is required to recognize a receivable representing the present value of these excess cash flows  which is subordinate to the investors interests 
the value of this recorded interest is subject to credit  prepayment  and interest rate risks 
at december   this recorded interest was million  of which million represents the original interest only asset and a million subsequent increase in value which is recognized as other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
in december  hann sold the beneficial interest in million of automobiles subject to operating leases to a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary the lessee 
the lessee sold such beneficial interests to a lessor the lessor  and the lessor in turn leased the beneficial interests in the automobiles and operating leases back to the lessee under a master lease agreement that has an eight year term with an early buyout option on january  for accounting purposes  the transaction is treated as a sale and an operating lease 
to support its obligations under the master lease agreement  the lessee pledges the beneficial interest in an additional million of automobile leases and related vehicles 
the lessee is expected to earn approximately million in other income over the term of the master lease agreement  which includes million of estimated net rental income  or the difference between the operating lease payments received by the lessee and the payments made by the lessee under the master lease agreement 
the estimated net rental income will be partially offset by the amortization costs of approximately million  which includes a million deferred loss on an interest rate swap which susquehanna entered into in order to fix the return on the transaction while leases originated for the sale leaseback were being held in a warehouse facility during the ten month production period 
the transaction documents contain several requirements  obligations  liabilities  provisions  and consequences  which become applicable upon the occurrence of an early amortization event 
an early amortization event includes the failure of the sold and pledged portfolios to meet certain performance tests or the failure of sus 
table of contents quehanna to continue to maintain its investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings 
this rating provision can be cured by susquehanna obtaining a million letter of credit from an eligible financial institution for the benefit of the equity participants in the transaction 
this is referred to in table as contingent cash collateral 
after an early amortization event  the lessee can no longer make substitutions under the master lease agreement  which means that the sales proceeds from the sold vehicles following termination of the related auto leases may not be used to purchase replacement vehicles and leases 
instead  the sales proceeds are used to make termination and other related payments under the master lease agreement  which would reduce the income the lessee is expected to earn over the term of the master lease agreement 
summary of susquehanna s potential exposure under all off balance sheet vehicle lease transactions 
under certain asset securitization transactions discussed above  susquehanna has reimbursement obligations to lenders under letters of credit if auto lenders breaches its obligations under such securitization transactions to purchase leased vehicles at the scheduled termination or expiration of the leases for the full stated residual value of the vehicles 
at december   susquehanna would be obligated to make payments in an amount up to million under these letters of credit upon a breach by auto lenders 
under the existing sale leaseback transaction discussed above  susquehanna guarantees certain obligations of the lessee thereunder  which is a wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of hann 
if susquehanna fails to maintain its investment grade senior unsecured long term debt ratings  then susquehanna must obtain a million letter of credit from an eligible financial institution for the benefit of the equity participants in the transaction to secure its obligations under the guarantee 
susquehanna has also obtained from a third party an million letter of credit for the benefit of an equity participant if susquehanna fails to make payments under the guarantee 
under the agency arrangements discussed above  susquehanna s maximum obligation at december   was million 
additionally  susquehanna is required to maintain contingent vehicle liability insurance coverage with regard to most of these transactions 
this same coverage is also maintained on vehicles within our own portfolio 
because vehicles are leased in the state of new york  a vicarious liability state  the ability to maintain our coverage or the premium cost could potentially have a negative impact on susquehanna 
the basic coverage policy is renewable annually and expires in contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
table presents certain of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  including susquehanna s guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries  and their expected year of payment or expiration 
table contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years over years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases contingent cash collateral commitment expiration total less than year years years over years other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit guarantees other commercial commitments  principally lines of credit capital adequacy 
risk based capital ratios  based upon guidelines adopted by bank regulators in  focus upon credit risk 
assets and certain off balance sheet items are segmented into one of four broad risk categories and weighted according to the relative percentage of credit risk assigned by the regulatory authorities 
off balance sheet instruments are converted into a balance sheet credit equivalents before being assigned to one of the four risk weighted categories 
to supplement the risk based capital ratios  the regulators issued a minimum leverage ratio guideline tier capital as a percentage of average assets less excludable intangibles 
capital elements are segmented into two tiers 
tier capital represents shareholders equity reduced by excludable intangibles  while tier capital represents certain allowable long term debt  the portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses equal to of risk adjusted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital 

table of contents the maintenance of a strong capital base at both the consolidated level  and at each bank affiliate  is an important aspect of our philosophy 
we  and each of our bank subsidiaries  have leverage and risk weighted ratios well in excess of regulatory minimums  and each entity is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
recent accounting pronouncements 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the objective of this interpretation is to provide guidance on how to identify a variable interest entity vie and determine when the assets  liabilities  non controlling interests  and results of operations of a vie need to be included in a company s consolidated financial statements 
a company that holds variable interests in an entity will need to consolidate the entity if the company s interest in the vie is such that the company will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses and or receive the majority of the entity s expected residual returns  if they occur 
fin also requires additional disclosures by primary beneficiaries and other significant variable interest holders 
the provisions of this interpretation became effective upon issuance 
as of december   we had variable interests in securitization trusts 
we are currently assessing the impact  if any  that the interpretation will have on results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
statement no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  statement no 
improves the clarity and prominence of disclosures about the pro forma effects of using the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation for all companies regardless of the accounting method used by requiring that the data be presented more prominently and in a more user friendly format in the footnotes to the financial statements 
the statement also improves the timeliness of those disclosures by requiring that this information be included in interim as well as annual financial statements 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of the statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we plan to continue accounting for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic method under apb no 
 and the pro forma impact of accounting for these options at fair value will continue to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements as required 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to guarantees 
in general  fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying guarantee that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
certain guarantee contracts are excluded from both the disclosure and recognition requirements of this interpretation  including  among others  guarantees relating to employee compensation  residual value guarantees under capital lease arrangements  commercial letters of credit  loan commitments  subordinated interests in an spe  and guarantees of a company s own future performance 
other guarantees are subject to the disclosure requirements of fin but not to the recognition provisions and include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 a parent s guarantee of debt owed to a third party by its subsidiary or vice versa  and a guarantee which is based on performance  not price 
the disclosure requirements of fin were effective as of december   and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of fin are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the requirements of fin to have a material impact on results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions 
the statement provides guidance on accounting for the acquisition of a financial institution  including the acquisition of part of a financial institution 
the statement defines criteria for determining whether the acquired financial institution meets the conditions for a business combination 
if the acquisition meets the conditions of a business combination  the specialized accounting guidance under statement no 
 accounting for certain acquisitions of banking or thrift institutions  will not apply after september   and the amount of the unidentifiable intangible asset will be reclassified to goodwill upon adoption of statement no 
the transition provisions were effective on october   and did not have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullifies eitf issue  and other costs to exit an activity including 
table of contents certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the statement delays recognition of these costs until liabilities are incurred and requires fair value measurement 
it does not impact the recognition of liabilities incurred in connection with a business combination or the disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of the statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and have not had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the statement updates  clarifies  and simplifies certain existing accounting pronouncements beginning at various dates in and the statement rescinds sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which required net gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt to be classified as an extraordinary item in the income statement 
these gains and losses will now be classified as extraordinary only if they meet the criteria for such classification as outlined in apb opinion  which allows for extraordinary treatment if the item is material and both unusual and infrequent in nature 
the statement also rescinds sfas no 
 related to the accounting for intangible assets for motor carriers  and amends sfas no 
to require certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions to be accounted for as such 
the changes required by sfas no 
are not expected to have a material impact on results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
critical accounting estimates 
susquehanna s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and conform to general practices within the banking industry 
application of these principles involves significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
the judgments and assumptions that we used are based on historical experiences and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions that we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
our most critical accounting estimates are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  we believe that the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses  the valuation of recorded interests  and the valuation of leased asset residual values to be the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
the treatment of securitizations and off balance sheet financing is discussed in detail in the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet financing 
the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan and lease portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan and lease losses 
recorded interests are established and accounted for based on discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected future cash flows  including assumptions about lease repayment rates  credit loss experience  and discount rates that consider the risk involved 
since the values of these assets are sensitive to changes in assumptions  the valuation of recorded interest is considered a critical accounting estimate 
note and the section titled securitizations and off balance sheet vehicle lease financings provide additional information regarding retained interests 
lease financing receivables include a residual value component which represents the estimated value of the leased asset upon the expiration of the lease 
the valuation of residual assets is considered critical due to the sensitivity in forecasting the impact of product and technology changes  consumer behavior  competitor initiatives  shifts in supply and demand  and economic conditions  among other factors  on the fair value of residual assets 
we protect ourselves against this risk with insurance coverage 
however  the future cost of this coverage will be affected by our residual loss experience 
any material effect on the consolidated financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed within the body of this document 
outlook for entering  we continue to emphasize the core components of our strategic plan growing our business profitably  developing our sales culture  and focusing on risk management 
we will again strive to increase core banking performance  improve company synergies  and explore merger and acquisition opportunities 
we will also embark on a renewed wealth management emphasis  involving the full integration of brokerage  trust and investment  and asset management services for our customer base
