item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
because we loan money to credit impaired borrowers  we may have a higher risk of delinquency and default 
loans made to borrowers who cannot obtain financing from traditional lenders generally entail a higher risk of delinquency and default and higher losses than loans made to borrowers with better credit 
substantially all of our auto loans are made to individuals with impaired or limited credit histories  or higher debt to income ratios than are permitted by traditional lenders 
if we experience higher losses than anticipated  our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects would be materially and adversely affected 
we may have to restrict our lending activities if we are unable to maintain or expand our sources of financing 
our ability to maintain or expand our current level of lending activity will depend on the availability and terms of our sources of financing 
we fund our operations principally through deposits  fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
the bank competes for deposits primarily on the basis of interest rates and  accordingly  the bank could experience difficulty in attracting deposits if it does not continue to offer rates that are competitive with other financial institutions 
federal regulations restrict the bank s ability to lend to affiliated companies and limit the amount of non mortgage consumer loans that may be held by the bank 
accordingly  the growth of our insurance premium and automobile finance businesses will depend to a significant extent on the availability of additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop additional financing sources on acceptable terms or at all 
to the extent the bank is unable to maintain its deposits and we are unable to develop additional sources of financing  we may have to restrict our lending activities  which would materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
for more information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the bank s california business focus and economic conditions in california could adversely affect our operations 
the bank  which is the principal funding source for our auto finance and insurance premium finance businesses  has a concentration of deposits in california 
the cost of our deposits may be affected by changes in california s economic and business conditions 
the occurrence of adverse economic conditions or natural disasters in california could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
our systems and controls may not be adequate to support our growth  and if they are not adequate  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
upfc depends heavily upon its systems and controls  some of which have been designed specifically for our banking  auto finance or insurance premium finance businesses  to support the evaluation  acquisition  monitoring  collection and administration of that business 
there can be no assurance that these systems and controls  including those specially designed and built for upfc  are adequate or will continue to be adequate to support our growth 
a failure of our automated systems  including a failure of data integrity or accuracy  could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
if we do not retain our key employees and we fail to attract new employees  our business will be impaired 
upfc is dependent upon the continued services of its key employees as well as the key employees of bpn 
the loss of the services of any key employee  or the failure of upfc to attract and retain other qualified personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
competition may adversely affect our performance 
each of our businesses is highly competitive 
competition in our markets can take many forms  including convenience in obtaining a loan  customer service  marketing and distribution channels  amount and terms of the loan and interest rates 
many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial  technical and marketing resources than upfc 
we compete in the insurance premium finance business with other specialty finance companies  independent insurance agents who offer premium finance services  captive premium finance affiliates of insurance companies and direct bill plans established by insurance companies 
we compete in the nonprime automobile finance industry with commercial banks  the captive finance affiliates of automobile manufacturers  savings associations and companies specializing in nonprime automobile finance  many of which have established relationships with automobile dealerships and may offer dealerships or their customers other forms of financing  including dealer floor plan financing and lending  which are not offered by upfc 
in attracting deposits  the bank competes primarily with other savings institutions  commercial banks  brokerage firms  mutual funds  credit unions and other types of investment companies 
fluctuations in interest rates and general and localized economic conditions also may affect the competition upfc faces 
competitors with lower costs of capital have a competitive advantage over upfc 
during periods of declining interest rates  competitors may solicit our customers to refinance their loans 
in addition  during periods of economic slowdown or recession  our borrowers may face financial difficulties and be more receptive to offers of our competitors to refinance their loans 
as we expand into new geographic markets  we will face additional competition from lenders already established in these markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with these lenders 
changes in interest rates may adversely affect our performance 
upfc s results of operations depend to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income 
further  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect demand for our financial products and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions  which are beyond our control 
our liabilities generally have shorter terms and are more interest rate sensitive than our assets 
accordingly  changes in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our lending activities 
for more information  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management of interest rate risk 
we may be unable to manage our growth  and if we cannot do so  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
upfc intends to pursue growth for the foreseeable future  particularly in its automobile finance business 
in addition  we may broaden our product offerings to include additional types of consumer or  in the case of ipf  commercial loans 
further  we may enter other specialty finance businesses 
this growth strategy will require additional capital  systems development and human resources 
the failure of upfc to implement its planned growth strategy would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
changes in general economic conditions may adversely affect our performance 
each of our businesses is affected directly by changes in general economic conditions  including changes in employment rates  prevailing interest rates and real wages 
during periods of economic slowdown or recession  we may experience a decrease in demand for our financial products and services  an increase in our servicing costs  a decline in collateral values and an increase in delinquencies and defaults 
a decline in collateral values and an increase in delinquencies and defaults increase the possibility and severity of losses 
although we believe that our underwriting criteria and collection methods enable us to manage the higher risks inherent in loans made to such borrowers  no assurance can be given that such criteria or methods will afford adequate protection against such risks 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  defaults or losses would materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
continuing qualification as a qualified thrift lender may adversely affect our growth and performance 
in order to meet the requirements of the qtl test  the bank maintains of its assets in qualified thrift investments which are residential mortgages and related investments such as mortgage related securities 
under the qtl test  indirect consumer loans are limited to of assets 
as of december   the bank s indirect consumer loans comprised of its assets 
if the bank fails to adjust and manage it sources of funds and assets it may not meet the qtl test  which means that its activities could be limited and our ability to grow would be adversely affected 
because we engage in a high level of subprime lending  we may be forced to meet higher capital requirements 
the bank engages in subprime lending  which is considered to be a high risk activity by the ots unless there are sufficient controls 
our subprime auto loan portfolio represented of our tier capital as of december because of the high percentage of subprime assets that comprise our tier capital  the ots has the authority to impose additional regulatory capital requirements of up to times higher than that normally required 
the ots may impose higher requirements even if there are sufficient controls in place 
if the otd imposes requirements to maintain high levels of regulatory capital  it could limit our ability to fund our operations and have an adverse effect on our ability to grow 
we may face other risks 
from time to time  upfc details other risks with respect to its business and financial results in its filings with the sec 
item properties our principal executive offices consisting of approximately  square feet are located at westerly place  suite  newport beach  california as of december   upfc maintained four branches for its banking business  branches for its automobile finance business  one location for its insurance premium finance business and one office site for bank operations 
all of our leased properties are leased for terms expiring on various dates to  many with options to extend the lease term 
the net investment in premises  equipment and leaseholds totaled million at december  compared to million at december  item legal proceedings upfc is a party from time to time in legal proceedings incidental to the conduct of its businesses 
management of upfc believes that the outcome of such proceedings will not have a material effect upon its financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
certain statements in this annual report on form k including statements regarding our strategies  plans  objectives  expectations and intentions  may include forward looking information within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in such forward looking statements 
for discussion of the factors that might cause such a difference  see item business factors that may affect future results of operations and other risks identified from time to time in our filings with the sec 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies  which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f certain accounting policies require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and we consider these to be critical accounting policies 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions  which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and our results of operations for the reporting periods 
a critical accounting policy that requires significant estimates and assumptions that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the preparation of our financial statements relates to the method we use to record the acquisition of purchased auto contracts and the subsequent recognition of interest income and credit losses 
uacc purchases auto contracts at a discount from face value 
historically  the bank has accounted for the purchase of auto contracts by recording the auto contract at face value  and allocating the remainder to the allowance for credit losses and unearned income 
this method resulted in estimated expected credit losses over the life of the contract being provided at the date of purchase and the credit adjusted yield being recorded as interest income over the life of the contract 
after consultation with the ots  commencing january   the bank has elected to allocate the purchase price entirely to auto contracts and unearned income at the date of purchase 
the unearned income will be accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the contract 
an allowance for credit losses will be established through provisions for losses recorded in income as necessary to provide for estimated contract losses net of remaining unearned income at each reporting date 
management expects that future results will reflect higher yields and provisions for credit losses being recorded from purchased auto contracts 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general in upfc reported income of million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share for the same period a year ago 
interest income for the year ended december  increased to million compared with million in while net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the same period a year ago 
gross automobile receivables were million at december  compared to million at december   accounting for much of the increase in interest income and net interest income 
interest income interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due primarily to a million increase in average interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest earning assets 
the largest components of growth in our average interest earning assets were automobile installment contracts  which increased million  and securities  which increased million 
the increase in auto contracts principally resulted from the purchase of additional dealer contracts in existing and new markets consistent with the planned growth of this business unit 
the increase in securities was primarily a result of the increase in assets required for the bank to meet the qtl test of the ots 
the decline in the average yield on interest earning assets was principally due to a general decline in the market interest rates and to the increase in securities  which have lower yields compared to loans 
securities  with an average yield of  comprised of our average interest earning assets at december  compared with of our average interest earning assets at december  interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   due to a basis point decrease in the weighted average interest rate on interest bearing liabilities  partially offset by a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the largest components of the increase in interest bearing liabilities were deposits of the bank  which increased to an average balance of million in from million in and repurchase agreements  which increased to an average balance of million in from an average balance of million in the increase in repurchase agreements resulted from the necessity to increase asset to comply with the test of the ots 
the average cost of deposits decreased to for from for  generally as a result of a decrease in market interest rates and the repricing of deposits to these lower market rates 
average balance sheets the following tables set forth information relating to our continuing operations for the years ended december   and the yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities allocated to continuing operations  respectively  for the periods shown

also  in  an additional  provision for loan losses was recognized in connection with the existing auto loan portfolio  compared to a provision of  in historically  in addition to the provision for loan losses  our allowance for loan losses was increased by an allocation of acquisition discounts related to the purchase of automobile installment contracts 
we allocated the estimated amount of acquisition discounts attributable to credit risk to the allowance for loan losses 
at december   we allocated of the net contract purchased to provision for loan losses compared to at december  commencing january   after consultation with the ots  the bank has elected to allocate the purchase price entirely to auto contracts and unearned income at the date of purchase 
the unearned income will be accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the contract 
an allowance for credit losses will be established through provisions for losses recorded in income as necessary to provide for estimated contract losses net of remaining unearned income at each reporting date 
management expects that future results will reflect higher yields and provisions for credit losses being recorded from purchased auto contracts 
our total allowance for losses was million at december  compared with million at december   representing of loans held for investment at december  and at december  net charge offs to average loans were for the year ended december  compared with in a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on our regular evaluation of loans held for investment and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while management believes it has adequately provided for losses and does not expect any material loss on its loans in excess of allowances already recorded  no assurance can be given that economic or other market conditions or other circumstances will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
non interest income non interest income decreased  to million in from million in the decrease resulted from a net gain on sale of loans of million in  which was not repeated in  partially offset by a  net gain on the sale of securities 
components of non interest income include fees and charges for bank services and miscellaneous other items 
the total of all of these items increased  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  non interest expense non interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily reflects an increase in salaries  employee benefits and other personnel costs of approximately million associated with the expansion of our automobile finance operations

during the fiscal year  the company opened new offices for a total of auto lending offices 
income taxes benefit income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase occurred as a result of a million increase in income before income taxes between the two periods 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  general in upfc reported income from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share  compared with a loss from continuing operations of million  or per diluted share for the same period a year ago

we recorded a pre tax charge of million during to reflect a write down in the value of residual interests arising from our subprime mortgage securitizations 
the residual interests were sold in january and were valued at december  according to the sale price and terms of this contract 
a pre tax charge of million  which was included in other expenses in the statement of operations  was also recorded during  relating to a write down of our goodwill arising from the purchase of norwest financial coast s insurance premium finance operations

comparison of financial condition at december  and december  total assets increased million  to million at december  from million at december  the increase occurred primarily as a result of a million increase in securities available for sale  which increased to million at december  from million at december  and a million increase in loans  which increased to at december  from at december   partially offset by a million decline in cash and cash equivalents 
loans increased as a result of planned expansion in our auto loan portfolio 
securities available for sale increased as a result of the conversion of short term investments and the reinvestment of proceeds of increased borrowings from repurchase agreements 
the increase in assets is required in order for upfc to meet the limitation on our auto loans as required by the qtl 
premises and equipment increased  to million at december  from million at december  primarily as a result of the continuing growth of our auto finance business

fhlb advances increased million to million at december  from million at december  reverse repurchase agreements were as of december  there were no outstanding repurchase agreements at december  the increase in fhlb advances and repurchase agreements was primarily due to our use of wholesale borrowings as an alternative to deposits as a funding source for asset growth 
net deferred tax assets were million at december  due principally to temporary differences in the recognition of reserves for loan losses and discontinued operations for federal and state income tax reporting and financial statement reporting purposes 
shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december   as a result of our profit of million   of unrealized gain on securities and a million increase as a result of stock options in the second quarter of  partially offset by a million repurchase of upfc stock 
management of interest rate risk the principal objective of our interest rate risk management program is to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our business activities  determine the level of appropriate risk given our operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives and manage the risk consistent with guidelines approved by the board of directors 
through such management  we seek to reduce the exposure of our operations to changes in interest rates 
the board of directors reviews on a quarterly basis the asset liability position of upfc  including simulation of the effect on capital of various interest rate scenarios 
upfc s profits depend  in part  on the difference  or spread  between the effective rate of interest received on the loans it originates and the interest rates paid on deposits and other financing facilities  which can be adversely affected by movements in interest rates 
the bank s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by the board of directors and management  through the use of a model  which estimates the change in the bank s net portfolio value npv over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and npv ratio is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
we review a market value model the ots npv model prepared quarterly by the ots  based on the bank s quarterly thrift financial reports filed with the ots 
the ots npv model measures the bank s interest rate risk by approximating the bank s npv under various scenarios which range from a basis point increase to a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
at december   the bank s sensitivity measure resulting from a basis point decrease in interest rates was basis points and would result in a million decrease in the npv of the bank and a basis point increase in interest rates was basis points and would result in a  increase in the npv of the bank 
at december   the bank s sensitivity measure was below the threshold at which the bank could be required to hold additional risk based capital under ots regulations 
although the npv measurement provides an indication of the bank s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurement is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on the bank s net interest income and will differ from actual results 
management monitors the results of this modeling  which are presented to the board of directors on a quarterly basis

while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans are a predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
we have continued to maintain the required levels of liquid assets as defined by ots regulations 
management  through its asset and liability committee  monitors rates and terms of competing sources of funds to use the most cost effective source of funds wherever possible 
a major source of funds consists of deposits obtained through the bank s four retail branches in california 
the bank offers checking accounts  various money market accounts  regular passbook accounts and fixed interest rate certificates with varying maturities and retirement accounts 
deposit account terms vary by interest rate  minimum balance requirements and the duration of the account 
interest rates paid  maturity terms  service fees and withdrawal penalties are established by the bank periodically  based on liquidity and financing requirements  rates paid by competitors  growth goals and federal regulations 
at december   such retail deposits were million or of total deposits 
retail deposits include internet deposits 
the bank solicits internet deposits by posting its interest rates on a national on line service  which advertises the bank s products to investors 
included in retail deposits at december  are million of internet originated deposits compared with million at december  the bank uses broker originated deposits to supplement its retail deposits and  at december   brokered deposits were million or of total deposits compared with million or at december  generally  most of the brokered deposit account holders are institutional investors  commercial businesses or public sector entities 
brokered deposits are originated through major dealers specializing in such products 
the increase in brokered deposits was caused by a decision to extend maturity in a favorable interest rate environment

however  as a result of these shorter term deposits  the rates on these accounts may be more sensitive to movements in market interest rates  which may result in a higher cost of funds 
at december   the bank exceeded all of its regulatory capital requirements with tangible capital of million  or of total adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or  core capital of million  or of total adjusted assets  which is above the required level of million  or and risk based capital of million  or of risk weighted assets  which is above the required level of million  or under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  the bank is deemed to be well capitalized at december  upfc has other sources of liquidity  including fhlb advances  repurchase agreements and the liquidity and short term securities portfolio 
through the bank  we may obtain advances from the fhlb collateralized by securities 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for thrifts and certain other member financial institutions 
advances are made pursuant to several programs each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
limitations on the amount of advances are based generally on a fixed percentage of net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of an institution s credit worthiness 
as of december   the bank s borrowing capacity under this credit facility was million with million unused because million of this facility was used to fund a repurchase agreement

historically  for uacc loans  a percentage of each new loan  of the net contract amount at december   was allocated to the allowance for loan losses 
this percentage was established by reviewing historical trends and levels of delinquencies and charge offs 
this percentage reflected the level of losses expected over the life of the loans 
periodically thereafter  management reviews the level of allowance for loan losses in light of any major changes in delinquencies and charge offs to assure the balance remains adequate to protect upfc from unexpected loss 
if this review reflects possible weakness  management will allocate an additional provision for loan loss  charged against current earnings  to maintain appropriate levels of allowance for loan losses 
commencing january   after consultation with the ots  the bank has elected to allocate the purchase price entirely to auto contracts and unearned income at the date of purchase 
the unearned income will be accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the contract 
an allowance for credit losses will be established through provisions for losses recorded in income as necessary to provide for estimated contract losses net of remaining unearned income at each reporting date 
management expects that future results will reflect higher yields and provisions for credit losses being recorded from purchased auto contracts 
for ipf loans  management establishes a level of allowance for loan losses based on recent trends in delinquencies and historical charge offs  currently of loans  that it feels is adequate for the risk in the portfolio 
each month an amount necessary to reach that level is charged against current earnings and added to allowance for loan losses

a loan is charged off or placed on nonaccrual status when it is delinquent for days or more 
when a loan is reclassified from accrual to nonaccrual status  all previously accrued interest is reversed 
interest income on nonaccrual loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash payments are received or the borrower s ability to make periodic interest and principal payments is in accordance with the loan terms  at which time the loan is returned to accrual status

these allowances include specific allowances for identifiable impairments of individual loans and general valuation allowances for estimates of probable losses not specifically identified 
in addition  our allowance for loan losses was also increased by the allocation of acquisition discounts related to the purchase of automobile installment contracts 
commencing january   after consultation with the ots  the bank has elected to allocate the purchase price entirely to auto contracts and unearned income at the date of purchase 
the unearned income will be accreted as an adjustment to yield over the life of the contract 
an allowance for credit losses will be established through provisions for losses recorded in income as necessary to provide for estimated contract losses net of remaining unearned income at each reporting date 
management expects that future results will reflect higher yields and provisions for credit losses being recorded from purchased auto contracts 
the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a variety of factors  including an assessment of the credit risk inherent in the portfolio  prior loss experience  the levels and trends of non performing loans  the concentration of credit  current and prospective economic conditions and other factors 
upfc s management uses its best judgment in providing for possible loan losses and establishing allowances for loan losses 
however  the allowance is an estimate  which is inherently uncertain and depends on the outcome of future events 
in addition  regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examinations process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the bank to increase the allowance based upon their judgment of the information available to them at the time of their examination 
cash equivalents and securities portfolio upfc s cash equivalents and securities portfolios are used primarily for liquidity and for investment income

the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of upfc are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent accounting developments accounting for asset retirement obligations in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair valued can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs would be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets in august  fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes both fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas for example  sfas provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used  as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
the company adopted sfas on january  management does not expect the adoption of sfas for long lived assets held for use to have any material impact on the company s financial statements because the impairment assessment under sfas is largely unchanged from sfas gains and losses from extinguishment of debt in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of sfas statements no

the provisions of sfas related to sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning and transactions occurring after may   respectively 
management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas replaces emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
acquisitions of certain financial institutions in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and and fasb interpretation no 
sfas  addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the acquisition of all or part of a financial institution  except for a transaction between two or more mutual enterprises 
sfas removes acquisitions of financial institutions  other than transaction between two or more mutual enterprises  from the scope of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain acquisitions of banking or thrift institutions  sfas  and financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 applying apb option no 
and when a savings and loan association or a similar institution is acquired in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method  and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and sfas thus  the requirement in sfas to recognize  and subsequently amortize  any excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as an unidentifiable intangible asset no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope of sfas sfas also provides guidance on the accounting for the impairment or disposal of acquired long term customer relationship intangible assets of financial institutions such as depositor and borrower relationship intangible assets and credit cardholder intangible assets 
those intangible assets are subject to the same undiscounted cash flow recoverability test and impairment loss recognition and measurement provisions that sfas requires for other long lived assets that are held and used 
the provisions of sfas are effective on october  management does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation  which clarifies previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for guarantees  expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees  and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
in general  the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on specified changes in an underlying variable that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
guarantee contracts excluded from both the disclosure and recognition requirements of the interpretation include  among others  guarantees relating to employee compensation  residual value guarantees under capital lease arrangements  commercial letters of credit  commitments to extend credit  subordinated interests in an spe  and guarantees of a company s own future performance 
other guarantees subject to the disclosure requirements of the interpretation  but not to the recognition provisions  include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
 a parent s guarantee of debt owed to a third party by its subsidiary or vice versa  and a guarantee which is based on performance but not price 
management does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for enterprises that elect to change to the sfas fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas will permit two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable sfas fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
both of those methods avoid the ramp up effect arising from prospective application of the fair value method under the existing transition provisions of sfas in addition  under the provisions of sfas  the original statement prospective method of transition for changes to the fair value method will no longer be permitted in fiscal periods beginning after december  sfas will also amend the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the disclosures to be provided in annual financial statements will be required for fiscal years ended after december   and the disclosures to be provided in interim financial reports will be required for interim periods begun after december   with earlier application encouraged 
presently  the company does not intend to adopt the fair value method

consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin  which requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
prior to fin  a company included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that the company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidated requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidated requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period after june  certain disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
management does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on the company s financial statements
