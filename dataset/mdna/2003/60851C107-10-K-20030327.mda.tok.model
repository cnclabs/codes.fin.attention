business business risks and qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk and the risks detailed from time to time in the company s sec reports  including this annual report on form k for the year ended december  we are a leading supplier of high performance bioanalytical measurement systems which accelerate and improve drug discovery and other life sciences research 
our systems and consumables enable pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to leverage advances in genomics  proteomics and combinatorial chemistry by facilitating the high throughput and cost effective identification and evaluation of drug candidates 
our solutions are based on its advanced core technologies that integrate our expertise in engineering  molecular and cell biology  and chemistry 
we enable our customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness  which ultimately accelerates the complex process of discovering and developing new drugs 
our customers include small and large pharmaceutical  biotechnology and industrial companies as well as medical centers  universities  government research laboratories and other institutions throughout the world 
no single customer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues in  or we recognize revenue on the sale of our products  when collectibility is reasonably assured  at the time of shipment and transfer of title to customers and distributors 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on our part 
service contract revenue is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
total service revenue was  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
in  sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of total revenues and total sales denominated in foreign currencies accounted for of total revenues 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates  however we may do so in the future 
we typically experience a decrease in the level of sales in the first calendar quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of the preceding year because of budgetary and capital equipment purchasing patterns in the life sciences industry 
we expect this trend to continue in future years 
in june  we acquired universal imaging corporation  a developer and distributor of cellular imaging software and drug discovery tools 
in  we acquired nihon molecular devices  a sales and service operation in japan  as well as cytion sa  a research and development company in switzerland 
we acquired all of the outstanding stock of ljl biosystems in a tax free  stock for stock transaction in august  as a result of which ljl biosystems became a wholly owned subsidiary 
the transaction was accounted for under the pooling of interests method of accounting and  accordingly  all financial information includes the operations of ljl biosystems for all periods presented 
all of the acquired companies were integrated into our existing business and accordingly no new operating segments were created 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of molecular devices financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  equity investments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and warranty we recognize product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title when collectibility is reasonably assured 
software revenue is recognized at the time of sale and in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop 
there are no significant customer acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on the part of molecular devices for product or software sales 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical experience and provided for at the time of sale 
freight costs for revenue generating shipments are charged to costs of goods sold 
amounts received prior to completion of the earnings process are recorded as customer deposits or deferred revenue  as appropriate 
service contract revenue is deferred at the time of sale and recognized ratably over the period of performance 
accounts receivable we sell our products primarily to corporations  academic institutions  government entities and distributors within the drug discovery and life sciences research markets 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  which are based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the current financial condition of specific customers  payment trends and the overall economic environment 
such losses have been historically within management s expectations 
inventories inventories are stated on a first in  first out basis at the lower of cost or market 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional inventory write downs may be required 
equity investments we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are included in other long term assets and are accounted for under the cost method when ownership is less than percent of voting securities and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operations 
when our ownership exceeds percent of voting securities but is less than percent  or we have the ability to exercise significant influence  the investment is accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  the investee s proportionate share of net income or loss and amortization of the investee s net excess investment over its equity in net assets is included in net income or loss 
as of december   we did not hold any investments accounted for under the equity method 
we regularly review the assumptions underlying the operating performance and cash flow forecasts in assessing the fair values 
we monitor the preceding factors to identify events or circumstances which would cause us to test for other than temporary impairment and revise our assumptions for the estimated recovery of equity investments 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized in the future 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate significant future taxable income 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
we will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances periodically 
various factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects upon our effective tax rate in and subsequent years 
these factors include  but are not limited to  interpretations of existing tax laws  changes in tax laws and rates  future levels of r d spending  future levels of capital expenditures  and our success in r d and commercializing products

years ended december  and revenues for increased by to million from million in this increase was due to the launch of the ionworks ht  along with the inclusion of seven months of revenue from universal imaging corporation uic  acquired on june  our revenues are broken into two product families 
the drug discovery product family  which includes cell analysis and hts systems  consists of ionworks ht  flipr  clipr  analyst  discovery and cytosensor systems 
the life sciences research product family  which includes bench top detection and liquid handling products  consists of maxline  skatron  metamorph and threshold products 
drug discovery product family revenues increased in due to launch of ionworks ht in the third quarter  increased sales of flipr products and the addition of the discovery product line from uic 
revenues in the life sciences research product family increased in largely due to the addition of the metamorph product line from uic and growth in sales of the threshold and skatron product lines 
gross margin decreased to in  from in this decrease was primarily due to overall product sales that were more heavily weighted in lower margin products 
research and development expenses increased by to million of revenues in from million of revenues in this increase was primarily driven by inclusion of a full year s research and development expenses at cytion sa cytion  which we acquired in july  and the research and development expenses incurred at uic 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million of revenues in from million of revenues in this increase resulted from the inclusion of the selling  general and administrative expenses of uic 
other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased by to million in from million in this was due to lower average cash and short term investment balances due to the share repurchase plan executed in the first quarter and the uic acquisition in the second quarter and decreased interest rates in we recorded tax provisions of million an effective tax rate of and million an effective tax rate of for and  respectively 
the decrease in our effective tax rate resulted from tax benefits recognized in associated with our international operations 
the effective tax rates for and are calculated on profit before tax excluding the write off of acquired in process research and development expenses in  which is not deductible for income tax purposes 

table of contents years ended december  and revenues for decreased by to million from million in the soft economic environment in affecting purchasing decisions on our higher priced instrument systems resulted in this top line decline 
drug discovery product family revenues were down from  due in large part to significant declines in the ljl product line 
this decline was offset by a increase in revenues from our life sciences research product family  led by the flexstation  which was introduced in the first quarter of gross margin decreased to in  from in the decrease related in part from decreased list prices for our ljl product line  as well as increased discounting on other high cost instruments in an attempt to offset the impact of the soft economic environment 
research and development expenses for decreased to million from million in  or a decrease of 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were in and in the decrease was the result of a reduction in spending in response to our revised economic outlook  as well as synergies created by our merger with ljl biosystems  offset by increased spending related to our acquisition of cytion 
we do not believe the decreased spending has materially impacted any development projects 
in july  we acquired cytion and accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
we allocated a portion of the purchase price to purchased in process technologies for million 
we wrote this off entirely in the third quarter of the write off of purchased in process technologies represented the fair value at the acquisition date  calculated utilizing the income approach  of the portion of certain in process research and development projects that were not reliant upon core technology 
the acquired in process research and development had no alternative future use at the date of acquisition 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased to million from million in  or an increase of 
the increased spending for the period is primarily the result of additional spending on marketing  sales and service related activities as we continued our efforts to expand worldwide market coverage and introduce new products 
in  we purchased our japanese distributor  nihon molecular devices 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were in and in the increase from to was a result of the costs at our japanese subsidiary  as well as the decline in overall revenues 
other income net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased by in to million from million in due to lower average cash and investment balances and the significant decline in interest rates in lower average cash balances result principally from a share repurchase plan under which we repurchased more than million shares of our common stock and our acquisition of cytion 
we recorded income tax provisions of million in and million in these provisions reflected a effective tax rate 
the effective tax rates for and are calculated on profit before tax excluding the write off of acquired in process research and development expenses in and merger expenses related to the ljl biosystems merger in  which are not deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  compared to million at december  in  operating activities provided million in cash 
net cash used by investing activities was million in  which included million spent on the acquisition net of cash acquired of uic and million of capital expenditures  partially offset by the proceeds from the net maturities of  of short term investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  due to million spent to repurchase  shares of our common stock  offset by  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock for options exercised and employee stock purchases 
the share repurchases all occurred in the first quarter of  and accounted for approximately of the shares outstanding as of december  and additionally  approximately million shares remain available for repurchase under the stock repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october 
table of contents our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities and anticipated cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan for the foreseeable future 
our facilities are leased under noncancelable operating leases 
in addition  we have a contractual commitment for the purchase of certain resale products and manufacturing components with certain vendors ending in as of december   the following is a summary of our contractual obligations in millions payments due by period to to and total thereafter operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets fas  which supersedes both statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of fas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
fas retains the fundamental provisions in fas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with fas for example  fas provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
fas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike fas  an impairment assessment under fas will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company adopted fas in the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
provides guidance related to accounting for costs associated with disposal activities covered by sfas no 
or with exit or restructuring activities previously covered by eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
supercedes eitf issue no 
in its entirety 
sfas no 
requires that costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring not be recognized until the liability is incurred 
the statement further establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of the liability and that employee benefit arrangements requiring future service beyond a minimum retention period be recognized over the future service period 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin establishes new disclosure and liability recognition requirements for direct and indirect debt guarantees with specified characteristics 
the initial measurement and recognition requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  however  the disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statement periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions and do not expect the full adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
this statement amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for the company s fiscal year the interim disclosure requirements are effective for the first quarter of fiscal year we continue to account for stock based compensation using apb and have not adopted the recognition provisions of sfas  as amended by sfas we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report for disclosures required by sfas 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments and further disclosures relating to financial investments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates  primarily us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
we invest our excess cash primarily in demand deposits with united states banks and money market accounts and short term securities 
these securities  consisting of million of commercial paper and million of us government agency securities  are carried at market value  which approximate cost  typically mature or are redeemable within to days  and bear minimal risk 
we have not experienced any significant losses on the investments 
we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in the united kingdom  france  japan  germany and canada  where we sell direct in local currencies 
all other foreign sales are denominated in us dollars and bear no exchange rate risk 
however  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in overseas markets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions have historically been immaterial 
translation gains and losses related to our foreign subsidiaries in the united kingdom  japan  germany  switzerland and norway are accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  but may do so in the future
