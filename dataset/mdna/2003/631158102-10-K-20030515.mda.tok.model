item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations fiscal vs 
sales sales for fiscal were  million compared to  million for fiscal  a decrease of 
the decrease is due to increased competitive pressures and a weak economy for fiscal the distribution of sales by operating segment is as follows operating segments food distribution   retail   military  food distribution segment sales decreased from fiscal to due to continued difficult economic conditions  soft sales and store closings because of increased competition in certain markets and the elimination of marginal accounts the company chose to no longer service 
retail segment sales decreased from fiscal to fiscal as declines in same store sales were largely offset by the acquisition of u save foods inc u save in the second half of fiscal same store sales  which compares retail sales for stores which were in operation for the same number of weeks in the comparative years  declined by from fiscal to fiscal and by for the fourth quarter of fiscal relative to the fourth quarter of fiscal these declines primarily reflected the growth of supercenter competition in our retail territories and retail consumers trading down and or purchasing less in conventional supermarket channels 
as a result of the competitive environment  we expect the trend of declining same store sales to continue in fiscal during fiscal  our corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of year we continued to actively respond to the increasingly competitive retail environment by expanding our two specialty store formats in fiscal the first format under the avanza banner is designed to service the hispanic market  which we believe is under served by conventional grocery stores 
we opened our first two prototype hispanic supermarkets in denver  colorado under the avanza trade name 
the second format under the buy n save banner is designed to service low income  value conscious consumers 
we opened three buy n save locations  converted two other existing stores to the buy n save format and closed an underperforming location  bringing the total number of buy n save stores in operation to eight compared to four stores in fiscal the expansion of these two new store formats is part of our strategy to differentiate ourselves in today s competitive retail markets 
military segment sales increased from fiscal to the increase is primarily attributed to higher year over year sales to bases overseas and us military ships afloat 
we expect the deployment of military forces in and about the middle east to temporarily benefit sales in our military segment 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was of sales compared to for fiscal gross profit was positively impacted by distribution efficiencies gained in our food distribution segment as well as more efficient use of promotional spending in our retail segment 
in addition  gross profit was increased by a lifo credit of million in fiscal compared to a lifo charge of million  in fiscal the lifo credit in fiscal is due to food price deflation and decreased inventory levels as a result of lower sales 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we elected to early adopt the provisions of eitf no 
accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  see new accounting standards below for discussion retroactive to the beginning of fiscal the impact of the adoption on gross profit in fiscal  excluding the cumulative effect adjustment  was an increase of million 
in addition  the adoption resulted in a reclassification of million of net cooperative advertising income from selling  general and administrative expenses to cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal  an increase of million or 
selling  general and administrative expense included a million charge in fiscal for retail impairments compared to a million charge recorded in fiscal the impairment charge for fiscal related to fifteen stores whose carrying values were impaired due to increased competition within the stores  respective market areas 
the estimated undiscounted cash flows related to these facilities indicated that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable based on current expectations  causing these assets to be written down in accordance with sfas no 
selling  general and administrative expenses also included a million charge for fiscal for closed store lease costs compared to a million charge recorded in fiscal the closed store lease costs were recorded for non cancelable lease costs related to closed corporate owned and independent customer stores where we were obligated to assume the lease liability 
selling  general and administrative expenses were also impacted by an increase in bad debt expense from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in bad debt expense is primarily due to a former customer that has filed for bankruptcy 
the foregoing charges were partially offset by million and million in gains on the sale of real estate for fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses were impacted by employee benefit costs which increased by million in fiscal relative to fiscal as a result of rising health care costs  offset by overhead cost reductions attained through process improvements and cost savings initiatives 
finally  selling  general and administrative expenses were increased as a result of the reclassification of net cooperative advertising income of million to cost of sales in accordance with eitf no 
see item of this report under the caption new accounting standards special charges we recorded special charges totaling million in fiscal and million offset by million of fiscal charge adjustments in fiscal these charges impacted our food distribution and retail segments as well as our produce growing and marketing business which was sold in fiscal  and were also designed to redirect our technologies efforts 
all actions contemplated by the charges are complete 
at december   the remaining accrued liability is million and consists primarily of lease commitments and pension and post employment related obligations 
during fiscal  we reversed million and million of our fiscal and fiscal special charges  respectively  due to an agreement reached to buyout the remaining lease for less than what we had originally estimated 
in addition  during fiscal we recorded million of pension benefits related to the distribution segment and million in continuing lease and exit costs related to closed retail stores through our and special charge reserves 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily reflects the elimination of goodwill amortization of million resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
 at the beginning of fiscal  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested at least annually for impairment 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million or 
the decrease primarily relates to a million reduction in interest expense paid under the revolving credit facility as a result of a lower average borrowing rate  partially offset by an increase in the average borrowing level under the credit facility 
the average borrowing rate under the credit facility was in fiscal and in fiscal the average borrowing level under the credit facility was million in fiscal and million in fiscal income tax expense the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to in fiscal the reduction in the effective rate is primarily attributed to changes in accounting rules relating to the elimination of goodwill amortization for financial reporting as well as a higher proportion of taxable income being generated in lower tax jurisdictions 
refer to the tax rate table in part ii  item of this report under note income taxes of notes to the consolidated financial statements for the comparative components of these rates 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle we adopted the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash considerations received from a vendor as of the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect at the beginning of fiscal was a charge of million  net of income taxes of million 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle has been presented in our consolidated statement of income as of december  see critical accounting polices under the caption vendor allowances and credits and new accounting standards in part ii  item of this report 
net earnings net earnings for fiscal were million  or per diluted share compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal excluding the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for fiscal due to the adoption of eitf no 
and excluding the goodwill amortization in fiscal  which was no longer required in fiscal upon the adoption of sfas no

sales sales for fiscal were  million compared to  million for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is attributed to new food distribution and military business we were able to capture in fiscal the distribution of total revenues by operating segment is as follows operating segments food distribution   retail   military food distribution segment revenues for fiscal were  million compared to  million for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase is primarily attributed to new food distribution customers as we continued to improve service to new and existing customers 
in addition  food distribution revenues were improved by the transfer of revenues from the retail segment as a result of the sale of corporate owned retail stores  in north and south carolina  to existing food distribution customers during fiscal retail segment revenues were  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal  an increase of 
the improvement is largely due to the acquisition of stores from u save on august   offset by the sale of the corporate owned stores in the southeast 
u save  a privately held company  operates stores primarily in nebraska 
all of the stores acquired have been converted to ourprimarybanners 
the sale of the southeast stores allows us to focus our retail strategy on store operations in the upper midwest 
same store sales  which compares retail sales for stores which were in operation for the same number of weeks in the comparative years  declined by  a direct result of reductions in promotional activity compared to fiscal and competitive pressures in certain markets 
during fiscal  our corporate store count changed as follows fiscal year number of stores at beginning of fiscal new stores acquired stores closed or sold stores number of stores at end of fiscal military segment revenues were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
the improvement reflects an addition of new business in europe and north carolina  awarded to us in fiscal by a major manufacturer 
the deployment of military forces in response to the september terrorist attacks had a short term negative impact  though not significant  on military sales 
the negative impact was a result of tighter security which prevented merchandise from reaching certain military bases as well as off base personnel having limited access to shop on the base 
gross profit gross profit was of sales for fiscal  compared to for fiscal the improvement is attributed to increased productivity  more efficient utilization of distribution facilities  improved sales mix of private label and value added products in retail stores and increased procurement efficiencies 
these increases were partially offset by a lifo charge of million  or 
of sales  in fiscal compared to a lifo credit of million  or 
of sales  which increased gross margins for fiscal the charge in fiscal is due to food price inflation and increased inventory levels to accommodate new business 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  both representing of sales  and an increase of million  or 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal included retail store impairments of million 
the write down of long lived assets resulted from our intention to close two stores  as well as the write down of the carrying value of three additional stores due to increased competition within the respective market areas which resulted in declining market share  deterioration of operating performance and inadequate projected cash flows for these stores 
there were no impairment charges recorded in fiscal bad debt expense of million was recorded in fiscal relative to million in the decrease is primarily due to a variety of accounts experiencing financial difficulty in fiscal in addition  selling  general and administrative expense for and included gains from the sale of real estate in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
substantially all of the gain in fiscal relates to the sale of real estate associated with a distribution center closed as part of the revitalization plan 
the fiscal real estate gains included million from the sale of real estate associated with a distribution center closed as part of the revitalization plan  while the remainder primarily relates to the sale of retail stores 
lease related costs associated with stores closed in fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
special charges all actions contemplated by the previously discussed special charges we recorded in fiscal and fiscal were complete at december  at december   the remaining accrued liability was million and consisted primarily of lease commitments and pension and post employment related obligations 
during fiscal  we recorded million of pension benefits related to the distribution segment and million in continuing lease and exit costs related to closed retail stores through our special charges reserve 
in addition  we recorded million and million related to warehouse and retail closing through our special charge reserve 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
the increase primarily reflects the addition of several new stores in fiscal and including the acquisition of u save  offset by the sale of the southeast stores 
interest expense interest expense for the year was relatively flat at million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal higher interest costs under the revolving credit facility resulted from the company fixing a rate under a swap agreement which expired on december  the average borrowing rate under the revolving credit facility  including the impact of the interest swap was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the rate difference was offset by an average revolving debt level that was million lower relative to fiscal income taxes the effective income tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the rate reduction is attributed to a decrease in the ratio of nondeductible goodwill to pretax income

net earnings net earnings for fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for fiscal critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions in applying certain critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most subjective and complex judgments 
we consider the following to be critical and could result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions vendor allowances and credits we participate with our vendors in a broad menu of promotions to increase sales of products 
these promotions fall into two main categories off invoice allowances and performance based allowances 
these promotional arrangements are often subject to negotiation with our vendors 
in the case of off invoice allowances  discounts are typically offered by vendors with respect to certain merchandise purchased by us during a specified period of time 
we use off invoice allowances to support a variety of marketing programs such as reduced price offerings for specific time periods  food shows  pallet promotions and private label promotions 
the discounts are either reflected directly on the vendor invoice  as a reduction from the normal wholesale prices for merchandise to which the allowance applies  or we are allowed to deduct the allowance as an offset against the vendor s invoice when it is paid 
in the case of performance based allowances  the allowance or rebate is based on our completion of some specific activity  such as purchasing or selling product during a certain time period 
this basic performance requirement may be accompanied by an additional performance requirement such as providing advertising or special in store promotion  tracking quantities of product sold as is the case with count recount promotions discussed below  slotting adding a new item to the system and merchandising a new item  or achieving certain minimum purchase quantities 
the billing for these performance based allowances is normally in the form of a bill back in which case we are invoiced at the regular price with the understanding that we may bill back the vendor for the requisite allowance when the performance is satisfied 
we collectively plan promotions with our vendors and arrive at the amount the respective vendor plans to spend on promotions with us 
we and the vendors then monitor  review and discuss the results of such promotions  and resolve issues relating to promotions and billings 
each vendor has its own method for determining the amount of promotional funds budgeted to be spent with us during the period 
in most situations  the vendor allowances are based on units we purchased from the vendor 
in other situations  the allowances are based on our past or anticipated purchases and or the anticipated performance of the planned promotions 
we jointly negotiate with our vendors the promotional calendar that governs all promotions 
forecasting promotional expenditures is a critical part of our twice yearly planning sessions with our vendors 
most vendors work with us to project not just overall spending  but also spending on a category and regional basis 
as individual promotions are completed and the associated billing is processed  the vendors track our promotional program execution and spend rate 
the vendors discuss the tracking  performance and spend rate with us on a regular basis throughout the year 
depending upon the vendor arrangements  such discussions can occur on a weekly  monthly  quarterly or annual basis 
these communications include future promotions  product cost  targeted retails and price points  anticipated volume  promotion expenditures  vendor maintenance  billing issues and procedures  new items discontinued items  and trade spend levels relative to budget per event and per year  as well as the resolution of any issues that arise between the vendor and us 
in the future  the nature and menu of promotional programs and the allocation of dollars among them may change as a result of ongoing negotiations and commercial relationships between vendors and the company 
eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  addresses how a reseller of a vendor s products should account for cash consideration received from a vendor and how to measure that consideration in its income statement 
we elected to early adopt the provisions of eitf no 
at the beginning of fiscal  and recognized a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  that represents the cumulative effect of the deferral of consideration received from vendors as of the beginning of fiscal excluding the cumulative impact  the adoption of eitf no 
on the year ended december  was an increase to net earnings of million  net of income taxes of million 
as is common in our industry  we use a third party service to undertake accounts payable audits on an ongoing basis 
these audits examine vendor allowances offered to us during a given year as well as cash discounts  freight allowances and duplicate payments and establishes a basis for us to recover overpayments made to vendors 
we reduce future payments to vendors based on the results of these audits  at which time we also establish reserves for commissions payable to the third party service as well as for amounts that may not be collected 
although our estimates of reserves do not anticipate changes in our historical payback rates  such changes could have considerable impact on our currently recorded reserves 
customer exposure and credit risk allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate the collectability of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in most circumstances when we become aware of factors that may indicate a deterioration in a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us eg  reductions of product purchases  deteriorating store conditions  changes in payment patterns  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
in determining the adequacy of the reserves  we analyze factors such as the value of any collateral  customer financial statements  historical collection experience  aging of receivables and other economic and industry factors 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the collectibility based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
if circumstances change ie  further evidence of material adverse creditworthiness  additional accounts become credit risks  store closures  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount  including to zero 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note accounts and notes receivable of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these allowances 
lease commitments we have historically leased store sites for sublease to qualified independent retailers  at rates that are at least as high as the rent paid by us 
under terms of the original lease agreements  we remain primarily liable for any commitments an independent retailer may no longer be financially able to satisfy 
we also lease store sites for our retail segment 
should a retailer be unable to perform under a sublease or should we close underperforming corporate stores  we record a charge to earnings for costs of the remaining term of the lease  less any anticipated sublease income 
calculating the estimated losses requires that significant estimates and judgments be made by management 
our reserves for such properties can be materially affected by factors such as the extent of interested sublessees and their creditworthiness  our ability to negotiate early termination agreements with lessors  and general economic conditions and the demand for commercial property 
more often than not  we have been able to re sublease such locations to other qualified retailers with minimal interruption of sublease recoveries and cost to us 
should the number of defaults by sublessees or corporate store closures materially increase  the remaining lease commitments we must record could have a material adverse effect on operating results and cash flows 
refer to part ii  item of this report under note leases of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of lease commitments 
guarantees of debt and lease obligations of others we have guaranteed the debt and lease obligations of certain of our food distribution customers 
in the event these retailers are unable to meet their debt service payments or otherwise experience an event of default  we would be unconditionally liable for the outstanding balance of their debt and lease obligations million as of december   which would be due in accordance with the underlying agreements 
in circumstances when we become aware of factors that indicate deterioration in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations guaranteed by us  we record a specific reserve in the amount we reasonably believe we will be obligated to pay on the customer s behalf  net of any anticipated recoveries from the customer 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we analyze factors such as those described above 
it is possible that the accuracy of the estimation process could be materially affected by different judgments as to the obligations based on information considered and further deterioration of accounts 
triggering these guarantees would not  however  result in cross default of our debt  but could restrict resources available for general business initiatives 
impairment of long lived assets impairment losses are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
we consider historical performance and estimated future results in our evaluation of potential impairment 
future results are often influenced by assessments of changes in competition  merchandising strategies  human resources and general market conditions  which may result in not recognizing an impairment loss 
no assurance can be given that these assessments and implementation of any resulting initiatives will result in profit margins sufficient to recover the carrying value of long lived assets 
reserves for self insurance we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  general and automobile liability and health insurance costs 
it is our policy to record our self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
worker s compensation and general and automobile liabilities are actuarially determined on a discounted basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  general and automobile and health insurance liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  such changes could have a considerable impact on future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed capital needs through a combination of internal and external sources 
these sources include cash flow from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing 
operating cash flows were million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in operating cash flows in fiscal was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts payable decreased by approximately million which was partially offset by a decrease in inventory balances of approximately million 
both of the changes are the result of management s efforts to reduce inventory levels in conjunction with lower sales volume from the continued difficult economy 
the changes in operating cash flows in fiscal were also due to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable increased by million primarily due to the discontinuance of a receivables securitization program in december  offset by increases in accounts payable of million and accrued expenses of million due to timing of payments and increased benefit costs  respectively 
cash used for investing activities for fiscal was million compared to million in and million in the reduction in cash used for investing activities in primarily relates to the level of acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal relative to fiscal and the reduction in loans extended to customers during fiscal investing activities in fiscal included million of business acquisitions and million in net payments received from customer loan activity 
in fiscal  investing activities included business acquisitions of million  primarily attributed to u save  and loans to customers  net of payments received  totaling million 
investing activities for included business acquisitions of million  which consisted of the hinky dinky supermarkets  inc acquisition in january of as well as three other stores  and loans to customers  net of payments received  totaling million 
cash used for financing activities for fiscal was million compared to million in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal in fiscal  cash used for financing activities was million 
cash used in financing activities increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to an increase in proceeds received from the revolving line of credit of million which was offset by a decrease in outstanding checks of million 
in fiscal  the proceeds from the revolving line of credit were million and there was an increase in outstanding checks of million 
in fiscal the company made a net payment on the revolving line of credit of million after it had completed the refinancing of the agreement 
in addition  the outstanding checks decreased by million in fiscal we have certain contractual obligations that extend beyond these commitments include long term debt and capital and operating lease obligations  primarily related to store locations for the our retail segment  as well as store locations subleased to independent food distribution customers 
the following summarizes these contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations in thousands total less than year years years over years long term debt      capital lease obligations     operating leases      total contractual cash obligations    the  shown as scheduled for payment in years includes repayment of the revolving credit facility based on the current outstanding balance of  typically  the company is able to refinance the credit facility with a new agreement either before or upon maturity of the current agreement

a discussion of lease commitments can be found part ii  item in this report under note leases in notes to consolidated financial statements and under the caption lease commitments under critical accounting policies  above

we also have made certain commercial commitments that extend beyond these commitments include standby letters of credit and guarantees of certain food distribution customer debt and lease obligations 
the following summarizes these commitments as of december  commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments in thousands total amounts committed less than year years years over years standby letters of credit    guarantees   total other commercial commitments    letters of credit relate primarily to supporting workers compensation obligations and are renewable annually

in december  we completed the refinancing of our revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement has a five year term and provides a million term loan and million in revolving credit 
borrowings under the term loan bear interest at the eurodollar rate plus a margin increase and a commitment commission on the unused portion of the revolver 
the margin increase and the commitment commission are reset quarterly based on movement of a leverage ratio defined by the agreement 
at december  the margin and commitment commission were and  respectively  compared to and at the end of the credit agreement contains financial covenants which  among other matters  require us to maintain predetermined ratio levels related to interest coverage  fixed charges coverage  leverage and working capital based on ebitda 
several of these financial covenants are based on ebitda with some adjustments adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined in our credit agreement as earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted to exclude extraordinary gains or losses  gains or losses from sales of assets other than inventory in the ordinary course of business  and non cash lifo and other charges such as closed store lease costs and retail impairments 
as of december   we were in compliance with all adjusted ebitda based debt covenants as defined in our credit agreement 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative measure of our net income  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
the amount of adjusted ebitda is provided as additional information relative to compliance with our debt covenants

the credit agreement also contains covenants that limit the company s ability to incur debt including guaranteeing the debt of others and liens  acquire or dispose of assets  pay dividends on and repurchase its stock  make capital expenditures and make loans or advances to others  including customers 
on february  we were notified by the trustee for our million senior subordinated notes  due in that a default had occurred under the indenture as a result of our failure to file our form q for the third quarter ended october  with the sec and that  unless remedied within the day grace period  such failure would constitute an event of default under the indenture 
in addition  if the default was not remedied within the days  an event of default would also occur under our bank credit facility 
on february  we announced that holders of more than of our senior subordinated notes agreed to waive the default under the indenture 
the waiver requires us to file our form q for the third fiscal quarter of by may  such holders also agreed to extend the time for us to file our form k for our fiscal year ended december  until may  and our form q for the first fiscal quarter ended march  until june  in consideration for the waiver  we paid a fee to the bondholders equal to of the outstanding principal amount of the notes 
on march   we announced that the requisite number of bank lenders under our revolving credit facility had agreed to extend until june  the deadline for submission to the lenders of our audited fiscal financial statements 
the credit agreement had originally called for us to provide to our lenders our audited financial statements for fiscal by march  in consideration for the amendment to the credit facility  we paid a fee to the bank lenders equal to of the sum of our revolving loan commitments and aggregate outstanding term loans as of the effective date of the amendment 
for debt obligations  the following table presents principal cash flows  related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and fair value as of december  fixed rate variable in thousands fair value amount rate fair value amount rate thereafter  we have market risk exposure to changing interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities and commodity price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
our objective in managing our exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows 
to achieve these objectives  we use derivative instruments  primarily interest rate and commodity swap agreements  to manage risk exposures when appropriate  based on market conditions 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading or other speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument 
the interest rate swap and commodity swap agreements are designated as cash flow hedges and are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet and the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
deferred gains and losses are amortized as an adjustment to expense over the same period in which the related items being hedged are recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the items being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in income 
interest rate swap agreements are entered into for periods consistent with related underlying exposures and do not constitute positions independent of those exposures 
at december   we had three outstanding interest rate swap agreements which commenced on december   july  and december   respectively 
the agreements expire on june   september  and october  with notional amounts of million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  we are using a commodity swap agreement to reduce price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
the commodity swap agreement  with a notional amount of  barrels per month  or approximately of our monthly fuel consumption  expires in august the three interest rate swap agreements described above total million in notional amounts  which are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contract 
interest rate swap agreements outstanding at year end and their fair value at that date are summarized as follows in thousands pay fixed receive variable   fair value  average receive rate average pay rate we expect our capital expenditures for fiscal to approximate million excluding acquisitions 
approximately million of the capital budget has been identified for use in the company s retail segment with the remaining balance relating to distribution maintenance  information technology and other corporate projects 
we believe that cash flows from operations  short term bank borrowings  various types of long term debt and lease and equity financing will be adequate to meet our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations for the foreseeable future

cautionary factors nash finch and its representatives may  from time to time  make written or oral forward looking statements relating to developments  results  conditions or other events that the company expects or anticipates will occur in the future 
these forward looking statements may involve a wide variety of topics  such as the company s future financial performance or condition  its strategies  market or economic conditions or the competitive environment 
any forward looking statements made are based on management s then current expectations and assumptions and  as a result  are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or conditions to differ materially from those predicted or projected 
the following cautionary factors are considered to be the more significant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted or projected by any forward looking statements  and are provided here as a readily available reference 
these factors are in addition to any other cautionary statements  written or oral  which may be made or referred to in connection with any forward looking statement  or contained elsewhere in this report 
competitive conditions the wholesale food distribution and food retailing businesses are intensely competitive  characterized by high inventory turnover  narrow profit margins and increasing consolidation 
our food retailing business  focused on the upper midwest  has historically competed with traditional grocery stores and is increasingly competing with alternative store formats such as supercenters  warehouse clubs and extreme value food stores 
our distribution business competes not only with local  regional and national food distributors  but also with vertically integrated national and regional chains utilizing a variety of formats  including supercenters  supermarkets and warehouse clubs 
some of our competitors are substantially larger and may have greater financial resources  lower merchandise acquisition costs and lower operating expenses than we do  intensifying price competition at the wholesale and retail levels 
industry consolidation and the expansion of alternative store formats  which have gained market share at the expense of traditional grocery stores  tend to produce even stronger competition for our food retail business and for the independent retailer customers of our distribution business 
to the extent our independent customers are acquired by competitors or are not successful in competing with other retail chains and non traditional competitors  sales by our distribution business will also be affected 
if we fail to effectively implement strategies to respond to these competitive pressures  our operating results could be adversely affected by price reductions  decreased sales or margins  or loss of market share 
economic conditions the food distribution and retailing industry is sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  particularly those that influence consumer confidence  spending and buying habits 
economic downturns or uncertainty may not only adversely affect overall demand and exacerbate price competition  but also cause consumers to trade down by purchasing lower priced  and often lower margin  items and to purchase less in traditional supermarket channels 
these consumer responses  coupled with the impact of general economic factors such as prevailing interest rates  food price inflation or deflation  employment trends in our markets  and labor and energy costs  can also have a significant impact on the company s operating results and performance with respect to forecasts 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
credit risk in the ordinary course of business  we extend credit  including loans  to our food distribution customers  and provide financial assistance to some customers by guaranteeing their loan or lease obligations 
we also lease store sites for sublease to independent retailers 
generally  our loans and other financial accommodations are extended to small businesses that are unrated and have limited access to conventional financing 
greater than expected losses from existing or future credit extensions  loans  guarantee commitments or sublease arrangements  particularly in times of economic difficulty or uncertainty  could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results 
expansion and acquisition the growth strategy for our retail and distribution businesses includes new store openings  new affiliations and acquisitions 
expansion is subject to a number of risks  including the adequacy of our capital resources  the location of suitable store or distribution center sites and the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms  the expansion into formats with which we have limited experience  and the ability to hire and train employees 
acquisitions entail certain additional risks such as identifying suitable candidates  effecting acquisitions at acceptable rates of return  timely and effectively integrating the operations  systems and personnel of the acquired business  and diversion of management s time and attention from other business concerns 
indebtedness and liquidity our current level of debt and covenants in the documents governing our outstanding debt could limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our ability to respond to market conditions and opportunities as well as capital needs could be constrained by the degree to which we are leveraged  by changes in the availability or cost of capital  and by contractual limitations on the degree to which we may  without the consent of our lenders  take actions such as engaging in mergers or acquisitions  incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures and making investments  loans or advances 
if needs or opportunities were identified that would require financial resources beyond existing resources  obtaining those resources could increase the company s borrowing costs  further reduce financial flexibility  require alterations in strategies and affect future operating results 
other factors other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted include changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations  changes affecting the food distribution and retail industry generally  such as a shift in consumer preferences towards eating away from home  other changes in consumer buying and spending patterns  the growth of alternative store formats  and the manner in which vendors target their promotional dollars  the ability to attract and retain qualified employees  unanticipated problems with product procurement and changes in vendor promotions or allowances  adverse determinations or developments with respect to litigation  other legal proceedings or the sec investigation of nash finch  the success or failure of new business ventures or initiatives  natural disasters and acts of terrorism 
the foregoing discussion of important factors is not exhaustive  and we do not undertake to revise any forward looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure in the financial markets consists of changes in interest rates relative to our investment in notes receivable  the balance of debt obligations outstanding  and derivatives employed from time to time to time to hedge long term variable interest rate debt 
in addition  we are using a commodity swap agreement to reduce price risk associated with anticipated purchases of diesel fuel 
we carry notes receivable because  in the normal course of business  we make long term loans to certain retail customers 
substantially all notes receivable are based on floating interest rates which adjust to changes in market rates 
as a result  the carrying value of notes receivable approximates market value
