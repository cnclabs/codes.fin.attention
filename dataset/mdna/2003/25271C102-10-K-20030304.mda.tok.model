item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
results of operations general revenues 
the company s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
when a rig is idle  generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  the company may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
during periods of mobilization  however  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  the company may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
revenues from dayrate drilling contracts are recognized currently 
the company may receive lump sum payments in connection with specific contracts 
such payments are recognized as revenues over the term of the related drilling contract 
mobilization revenues  less costs incurred to mobilize an offshore rig from one market to another  are recognized over the primary term of the related drilling contract 
revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met 
income is recognized on the completed contract method 
provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract 
revenues from reimbursements received for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of the customer in accordance with a contract or agreement are recorded for the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
prior to and the guidance provided by the emerging issues task force eitf income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expense incurred  the company accounted for reimbursements  in most instances  as a reduction of expenses incurred 
all comparative periods presented have been reclassified to comply with this guidance 
operating income 
operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  the company may realize few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  the company is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically a cost of the operator under drilling contracts 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  the company may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
the company recognizes as operating expenses activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls  which meet certain criteria  that maintain rather than upgrade its rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
increased depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
critical accounting estimates the company s significant accounting policies are included in note of its notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
management s judgments  assumptions and estimates are inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements and the application of its significant accounting policies 
the company believes that its most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
drilling and other property and equipment is carried at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized on the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
the company also evaluates its property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
management s assumptions are an inherent part of an asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
the company s retention of liability for personal injury claims  which primarily results from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  is million per claim with an aggregate annual deductible of million 
the company estimates its liability for personal injury claims based on the existing facts and circumstances in conjunction with historical experience regarding past personal injury claims 
eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ significantly from the estimated amounts 
years ended december  and comparative data relating to the company s revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are listed below eliminations offset i dayrate revenues earned when the company s rigs are utilized in its integrated services and ii intercompany expenses charged to rig operations 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed

revenues 
revenues from high specification floaters decreased million during the year ended december  from the same period in decreases in the average operating dayrate contributed million to the revenue decline as dayrates dropped from  per day during to  per day during excluding the ocean baroness 
all of the rigs in this classification  except the ocean confidence  experienced a decline in dayrates during most significantly  average dayrates went from  to  for the ocean valiant   to  for the ocean victory  and  to  for the ocean america 
utilization fell from in to in lower utilization in excluding the ocean baroness which was in a shipyard undergoing an upgrade during all of accounted for million of the overall decrease in revenue 
the ocean america was idle for approximately five months during but worked most of in the ocean star and the ocean victory spent three and one half months and two months  respectively  in a shipyard for inspections and repairs but both worked all of revenues generated by the ocean baroness  which began operations in mid march after completing an upgrade to high specification capabilities  partially offset the overall decline in revenue for the year ended december  by million 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended december  increased million from the same period in operating expenses for the ocean baroness added million to contract drilling expense and included costs incurred in connection with the recovery of its marine riser  net of insurance recoveries  as well as its normal operating costs 
shipyard inspections and repairs of the ocean star  ocean victory  and the ocean quest in resulted in an increase in expenses of million 
higher brazilian customs fees in for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the ocean alliance and the ocean clipper added million to operating costs 
repairs to the ocean america and boat and fuel costs while the rig was idle  contributed an additional million to contract drilling expenses 
the recognition of a million revision to an estimated insurance deductible for the ocean clipper  which lowered costs in  also contributed to the higher comparative costs in other semisubmersibles 
revenues 
revenues from other semisubmersibles decreased million from the year ended december  to the same period of lower utilization accounted for million of the decrease  dropping to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the ocean voyager and the ocean endeavor have both been cold stacked since march while both of these rigs worked the majority of the ocean new era was idle or cold stacked all of but worked almost half of during part of the ocean worker was in a shipyard for inspection and repairs and the ocean saratoga was in a shipyard for repairs 
both of these rigs worked most of improved utilization for the ocean bounty  which operated most of compared to being stacked for approximately two months in  was partially offsetting 
lower overall average dayrates contributed million to the decrease in other semisubmersibles revenue 
however  the average operating dayrate for this fleet increased to  during the year ended december  from  during the same period of this occurred because several of the rigs that were contracted at lower dayrates in were stacked throughout parts of consequently  the average operating dayrate rose in for the working rigs in this class 
significant changes in average operating dayrates included the ocean worker and the ocean whittington which decreased approximately  and  respectively  and the ocean guardian and ocean princess which increased approximately  and  respectively 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles was million lower in than in the ocean endeavor and the ocean voyager  which have been cold stacked since march  contributed cost savings of million while the ocean new era and the ocean ambassador  which were both stacked with reduced crews for most of  lowered costs by million 
contract drilling expenses for the ocean whittington were lower by million in when compared to resulting from its inspection  repairs and preparation for its mobilization to namibia in december partially offsetting was an increase in of contract drilling expenses for the ocean nomad of million 
in the rig was in a shipyard for an upgrade which resulted in lower operating costs 
in addition  inspection and repairs to the ocean worker added million to contract drilling expense in also  higher brazilian customs fees in for the importation of spare parts and supplies for the ocean yatzy  ocean yorktown and the ocean winner resulted in a million increase in contract drilling expense 
jack ups 
revenues 
revenues from jack ups during the year ended december  decreased million from the same period of a reduction in the average operating dayrate from  in to  in  contributed million to the overall revenue decline 
all of the gulf of mexico jack up rigs experienced lower average operating dayrates in only the ocean heritage  a rig which operated offshore indonesia and australia  saw a significant improvement in its dayrate  from  in to  in revenues decreased million as a result of a decline in utilization to in from in utilization was down for the ocean champion  which was idle and or cold stacked throughout  and for the ocean spartan  ocean spur  ocean tower and the ocean heritage all of which spent time in shipyards during undergoing upgrades 
all five of these jack ups worked most of higher utilization in for the ocean sovereign  which worked all of but spent most of in a shipyard for repairs  was partially offsetting 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for jack ups decreased million in compared to contract drilling expense was million lower in for the ocean spartan  ocean spur  ocean tower and the ocean heritage as a result of a reduction in operating costs while these rigs were in shipyards undergoing upgrades 
contract drilling expense was million lower for the ocean champion which was idle and or cold stacked during all of but worked most of increased contract drilling expense during the first half of from repairs to the ocean nugget  the ocean crusader  and the ocean summit also contributed to the lower comparative costs in higher expenses for the ocean heritage in  primarily due to the mobilization of the rig from indonesia to australia and higher labor costs in australia  were partially offsetting 
integrated services 
operating income for integrated services decreased million during the year ended december  compared to the same period of resulting from the difference in type and magnitude of projects during those periods 
during  an operating loss of million resulted primarily from an unprofitable turnkey project in the gulf of mexico 
during the same period in  operating income of million was primarily due to the completion of one international turnkey project and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the gulf of mexico 
other 
other operating income of million for the year ended december  increased million from the same period in the increase resulted primarily from a million reimbursement of prior year foreign income tax to be received by the company from its customers and relates to a tax settlement made between the company and the norwegian tax authorities in december the corresponding income tax expense is reflected in income tax expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
also contributing to the higher other operating income in was a million reversal of an accrual made in a prior year for personal injury claims and the elimination of a million reserve for inventory obsolescence  from prior years  that was deemed no longer necessary 
reimbursables  net 
revenues related to reimbursable items that the company purchases and or services it performs at the request of its customers offset by the related expenditures for these items were million in compared to million in depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million over the same period of higher depreciation resulted primarily from depreciation for capital additions and additional depreciation for the ocean baroness  which completed its deepwater upgrade and began operations in march the suspension of goodwill amortization on january  partially offset this increase 
goodwill amortization during the year ended december  was million 
see note goodwill and note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
general and administrative expense

revenues 
revenues from high specification floaters increased million during the year ended december  from the same period in of this increase  million was attributable to the ocean confidence  which began operations in early january after completion of a conversion to a high specification drilling unit 
the rig was undergoing this conversion throughout higher average operating dayrates contributed million to the revenue improvement from to average operating dayrates increased from  during to  excluding the ocean confidence during the ocean alliance and the ocean america experienced the greatest increases in dayrates with an average increase of  per day and  per day  respectively 
improved utilization for high specification floaters in accounted for million of the increase in revenues over utilization for this class of rig rose to in from in excluding the ocean confidence 
the greatest improvements were from the ocean quest  which was idle for almost five months longer in than in  and the ocean clipper  which had less downtime for repairs during contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for high specification floaters during the year ended december  increased million from the same period in this increase resulted primarily from costs incurred by the ocean confidence million which began operations in january other semisubmersibles 
revenues 
revenues from other semisubmersibles increased million during the year ended december  from the same period in primarily due to higher average operating dayrates 
average dayrates increased to  per day in from  in and contributed an additional million to revenues 
the greatest dayrate increases were for the ocean general  ocean nomad  ocean guardian and the ocean bounty 
however  lower average operating dayrates in for the ocean princess and the ocean whittington were partially offsetting 
improvements in utilization contributed million to revenue during the year ended december  compared to the same period in overall  utilization increased to in from in the ocean epoch spent most of in a shipyard for water depth capability and variable deckload upgrades while it worked most of the ocean voyager  ocean new era and the ocean guardian were all idle approximately one half year longer in compared to however  utilization decreased in for the ocean whittington and the ocean yorktown

the ocean yorktown was in a shipyard for over two months in for inspection and upgrades in connection with new contract requirements 
contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense for other semisubmersibles during the year ended december  increased million from the same period in rig expenses increased million for the ocean epoch in from the same period in when most of the expenses were associated with the rig s upgrade and were capitalized 
the ocean new era s expenses increased million in as it operated during six months of but was stacked all of an additional million in contract drilling expense resulted from the mobilization of the ocean whittington from brazil to namibia in late also  contract drilling expense increased million from the inspections of the ocean yorktown  ocean whittington  ocean yatzy and ocean princess and million from higher brazilian customs fees in partially offsetting these cost increases  contract drilling expenses were million lower in due to ocean lexington and ocean saratoga repair projects in not repeated in jack ups 
revenues 
revenues from jack ups during the year ended december  increased million from all of the company s jack up rigs experienced higher average operating dayrates with the overall average operating dayrate improving from  in to  in this improvement in average operating dayrates resulted in an increase of million in revenues 
lower utilization in than in partially offset the revenue improvements that resulted from the higher average operating dayrates 
revenue declined million in as a result of utilization in compared to in this decrease in utilization was primarily due to inspection and repairs of the ocean summit  ocean sovereign  ocean crusader and ocean champion during in addition  the ocean nugget was stacked for over one half of and the ocean king was in a shipyard for part of the last two months of for inspections and repairs 
all of these rigs worked most of utilization improvements which were partially offsetting resulted from the ocean heritage and the ocean tower 
the ocean heritage  which worked all of  spent part of in a shipyard for repairs while the ocean tower worked most of but was cold stacked for part of contract drilling expense 
contract drilling expense increased million for jack ups during the year ended december  compared to the same period in operating costs were higher in for the ocean champion  ocean summit and ocean crusader due to inspection and repairs 
in addition  rig expenses were higher for the ocean tower which operated during most of  but was cold stacked during part of contract drilling expense decreased in for the ocean heritage due to major repairs in integrated services 
operating income for integrated services decreased as a result of the difference in number  type and magnitude of projects during compared to during  integrated services contributed operating income of million to the company s consolidated results of operations primarily due to the completion of one international turnkey project  which began in the last quarter of  and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the gulf of mexico

depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased million over the prior year 
higher depreciation in resulted primarily from depreciation for the ocean confidence  which completed its conversion from an accommodation vessel to a high specification semisubmersible drilling unit and commenced operations in january also  depreciation was higher due to an increase of million in ordinary capital expenditures compared to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million in compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase in personnel costs  travel and professional expenses 
gain on sale of marketable securities 
gain on sale of marketable securities of million for the year ended december  increased million from million for the same period in gain on sale of assets gain on sale of assets of million for the year ended december  decreased million from million for the same period in primarily due to the january sale of the company s jack up drilling rig  ocean scotian which had been cold stacked offshore the netherlands prior to the sale 
the rig was sold for million in cash which resulted in a gain of million million after tax 
interest income 
interest income of million for the year ended december  decreased million from million for the same period in this decrease resulted from the company s investment in marketable securities with lower interest rates in compared to and was partially offset by the investment of higher cash balances generated by the sale of the company s convertible senior debentures due the debentures on april   the sale of the company s zero coupon convertible debentures due the zero coupon debentures on june  and the december lease leaseback of the ocean alliance 
cash balances available for investment were partially reduced as a result of the company s redemption of all of its outstanding notes on april  see liquidity 
interest expense 
interest expense of million for the year ended december  increased million from million for the same period in primarily due to the million pre tax loss from the april redemption of the company s notes and less interest capitalized due to the completion of the ocean confidence conversion million interest capitalized in compared to million interest capitalized in 
in addition  interest expense increased with the issuance of the zero coupon debentures on june   the issuance of the debentures on april  and interest expense related to the december lease leaseback of the ocean alliance 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in interest expense resulting from the company s redemption of all of its outstanding notes on april  see liquidity 
other income and expense other  net 
other expense of million for the year ended december  increased million from other expense of million for the same period in this increase resulted primarily from a million reserve for the then pending litigation in connection with a proposed class action suit filed against major offshore drilling companies partially offset by a million receipt of a settlement payment for resolved litigation 
income tax expense 
income tax expense of million for the year ended december  increased million from million in primarily as a result of the increase in income before income taxes of million in  which was partially offset by a lower effective income tax rate in the lower effective income tax rate in was primarily due to the company s decision to permanently reinvest part of the earnings of its uk subsidiaries 
industry conditions the company operates in an industry that is historically extremely competitive and deeply cyclical 
the demand for its services has traditionally been highly correlated with the price of oil and natural gas 
however  the rise in product prices that began in late and continued throughout did not yield the expected improvements in utilization and dayrates for the company s equipment 
the company believes that its customers have been reluctant to increase offshore drilling expenditures or to commit to long term contracts due to uncertainties about the sustainability of current product prices as well as general uncertainties surrounding the state of the economy and the effects of a possible military conflict in iraq 
in the gulf of mexico  well to well contracts are the norm for the company s deep water semisubmersible fleet  its mid water semisubmersible fleet and its jack up fleet 
with limited to no backlog of work for these fleets  the company does not anticipate any significant improvement in utilization or rates until its customers regain confidence in the sustainability of product prices 
absent a change in its customers perception of the overall energy market  the company anticipates that the international markets in which it operates will remain relatively flat and consequently expects utilization and rates for its equipment in these markets to remain relatively unchanged

integrated services the company s wholly owned subsidiary  dots  from time to time  selectively engages in drilling services pursuant to turnkey or modified turnkey contracts under which dots agrees to drill a well to a specified depth for a fixed price 
in such cases  dots generally is not entitled to payment unless the well is drilled to the specified depth and other contract requirements are met 
profitability of the contract is dependent upon its ability to keep expenses within the estimates used in determining the contract price 
drilling a well under a turnkey contract therefore typically requires a greater cash commitment by the company and exposes the company to risks of potential financial losses that generally are substantially greater than those that would ordinarily exist when drilling under a conventional dayrate contract 
dots also offers a portfolio of drilling services including overall project management  extended well tests  and completion operations 
during  dots had an operating loss of million primarily from an unprofitable gulf of mexico turnkey project 
during  dots contributed operating income of million to the company s consolidated results of operations primarily from the completion of one international turnkey project  which began in the last quarter of  and three turnkey permanent plug and abandonment projects in the gulf of mexico 
other currency risk 
certain of the company s subsidiaries use the local currency in the country where they conduct operations as their functional currency 
currency environments in which the company has material business operations include brazil  the uk  australia and vietnam 
the company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the company s estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in us dollars 
because of this strategy  historically the company has minimized its unhedged net asset or liability positions denominated in local currencies and has not experienced significant gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates 
at present  however  only contracts covering the company s five rigs currently operating in brazil are payable both in us dollars and the local currency 
the company has not hedged its exposure to changes in the exchange rate between us dollars and the local currencies  except in australia for operating costs payable in the local currencies in which it operates  but it may seek to do so in the future 
currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate section of stockholders equity 
when the company ceases its operations in a currency environment  the accumulated adjustments are recognized currently in results of operations 
the effect on results of operations from these translation gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future 
forward exchange contracts 
in some instances  a foreign exchange forward contract is used to minimize the forward exchange risk 
a forward exchange contract obligates the company to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specified dates 
in june the company entered into forward contracts to purchase million australian dollars  million australian dollars to be purchased monthly from august  through june  and million to be purchased on july  in july the company entered into twelve forward contracts to purchase million australian dollars at each month end through july  accounting standards in december the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the company s measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the company at december  and assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
the company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since the company s investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it 
the company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
the company s investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the company s investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the company s earnings or shareholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company s long term debt  as of december  and is denominated in us dollars 
the company s debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of and million  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of and million  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
as of december   the company had contracted to purchase million australian dollars  million australian dollars to be purchased monthly from august  through june  and million to be purchased on july  these foreign exchange forward contracts are recorded at their fair value determined by discounting future cash flows at current forward rates 
at december   an asset of million reflecting the fair value of the forward contracts  was included with prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet 
at december  the company had contracted to purchase million australian dollars each month through july  at december   an asset of million reflecting the fair value of the forward contracts  was included with prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  and  with all other variables held constant
