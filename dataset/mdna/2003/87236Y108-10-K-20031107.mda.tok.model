unless otherwise indicated  references to we  us or company in this report mean ameritrade holding corporation and its subsidiaries 
overview we provide securities brokerage and clearing execution services to our clients through our principal retail and clearing broker dealer  ameritrade  inc substantially all of our net revenues are derived from our brokerage activities and clearing and execution services 
our primary focus is serving retail clients by providing services at prices that are generally lower than most of our competitors 
our brokerage clients are able to trade securities with us through a variety of channels  principally the internet 
we provide our clients with investment news and information as well as educational services 
we also provide clearing and execution services to our brokerage operations as well as to unaffiliated broker dealers 

table of contents our largest sources of revenue are commissions earned from our brokerage activities and associated securities transaction clearing fees 
our other principal source of revenue is net interest revenue 
net interest revenue is the difference between interest revenues and client interest expense 
interest revenues are generated by charges to clients on margin balances maintained in brokerage accounts and the investment of cash from operations and cash segregated in compliance with federal regulations in short term marketable securities 
client interest expense consists of amounts paid or payable to clients based on credit balances maintained in brokerage accounts 
we also receive payment for order flow  which results from arrangements we have with many execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution and is included in commissions and clearing fees on the statement of operations 
our largest operating expense generally is employee compensation and benefits 
employee compensation and benefits expense includes salaries  bonuses  group insurance  contributions to benefit programs  recruitment and other related employee costs 
communications expense includes telecommunications  postage  news and quote costs 
occupancy and equipment costs include the costs of leasing and maintaining our office spaces and the lease expenses on computer and other equipment 
depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on property and equipment  as well as amortization of intangible assets 
professional services expense includes costs paid to outside firms for assistance with legal  accounting  technology  marketing and general management issues 
interest on borrowings consists of interest expense on our convertible subordinated notes and other borrowings 
other operating expenses include commissions and clearance expenses  trade execution fees  provision for losses  client execution price adjustments  travel expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
in addition  our costs related to the processing of client confirmations  statements and other communications are included in this category 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred and include production and placement of advertisements in various media  including online  television  print and direct mail 
advertising expenses may increase or decrease significantly from period to period 
we believe that the online securities brokerage market is currently impacted by four significant trends that may affect our financial condition and results of operations 
first  price is an important component of the value proposition for the online securities brokerage market 
this trend has resulted in the implementation of various strategies such as tiered pricing  account maintenance fees  order handling fees and per share charges 
second  technology has increased in importance  as delivery channels such as the internet have become more prevalent 
the vast majority of our trades and an increasing percentage of our client support activities are now placed through electronic media  primarily the internet 
this increased use of electronic media has helped to decrease operating expenses per trade over the past several years and we believe this trend will continue 
third  the increasing recognition of the need for scale and required investment in technology have resulted in consolidation in the industry 
finally  we believe the intense advertising and promotional efforts by our major competitors and us are making it increasingly difficult for new entrants to make a competitive impact without substantial financial resources to invest in building a brand 
our fiscal year ends on the last friday in september 
references to fiscal year in this document or in the information incorporated herein by reference are to the approximate twelve month period ended on any such friday 
for example  fiscal refers to the fiscal year ended september  business combination on september   we completed our merger with datek 
pursuant to the merger agreement  ameritrade online holdings corp 
aoh formerly ameritrade holding corporation and datek each became wholly owned subsidiaries of a newly formed holding company  which was renamed ameritrade holding corporation 
upon the closing of the transaction  stockholders of aoh and datek each received shares of a single class of common stock of the new holding company  with the stockholders of aoh and the stockholders of datek each receiving approximately percent of the total outstanding common stock 
we have completed most of the integration of datek s business with ours 
datek s client call center function was moved to call centers in omaha  nebraska and ft 
worth  texas shortly after completion of the merger 
website enhancements to both ameritrade s and datek s front end websites  along with a new pricing schedule  were implemented on october  effective march   we consolidated the clearing 
table of contents function performed by datek into the ameritrade  inc clearing platform 
late in fiscal  we began phasing in a single web architecture trading platform 
during fiscal  we expect to phase in a single point of entry to the trading platform for both ameritrade and datek clients 
the integration plans for the operations of ameritrade and datek are subject to change 
at the time of the merger  we anticipated synergies from the merger resulting from cost savings programs  estimated to be approximately million on an annualized  pre tax basis  including million of advertising synergies 
we achieved approximately million of pre tax synergies in fiscal  excluding advertising synergies  and we expect to realize an incremental million in pre tax synergies for fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees increased percent to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the full year impact of adding  core accounts in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the datek merger  increased client trading activity and increased commissions and clearing fees per trade 
average trades per day increased percent to  for fiscal from  in fiscal clients averaged approximately trades per account during fiscal  compared to approximately trades per account for fiscal commissions and clearing fees per trade increased to in fiscal from for fiscal  due primarily to the implementation of a new pricing schedule effective october  and an increase in the average number of contracts per options trade  partially offset by slightly lower payment for order flow revenue per trade during fiscal compared to fiscal under the new pricing schedule  commissions for online equity trades are for both market and limit orders  regardless of the number of shares bought or sold with no additional order handling fees 
under the previous pricing schedule  commissions for online equity market orders were  while online equity limit orders were 
flat commission pricing was also implemented for interactive voice response system trades  at per trade previously for market orders and for limit orders 
broker assisted trades are now for market orders  with an additional fee for limit orders 
we expect average commissions and clearing fees per trade to range from approximately to per trade during fiscal  depending on the mix of trading activity  level of payment for order flow revenue and other factors 
in august  nasd  inc directed our broker dealer subsidiaries  iclearing llc and ameritrade  inc  to cease permitting cash account clients to utilize the proceeds from the sale of fully paid for securities to purchase other securities in advance of the actual receipt of proceeds from the settlement of the sale of the fully paid for securities the specified trades 
we have completed the changes to our systems and procedures required to address this restriction 
while trading activity in cash accounts that we had identified as engaging in specified trades decreased substantially in the second and third fiscal quarters  we have not been able to quantify the impact of the restrictions on the company s revenues and earnings 
we believe that clients modification to their trading activity  conversion to margin accounts or closing of cash accounts as a result of the restrictions for the most part occurred by the end of the third fiscal quarter 
net interest revenue increased percent to million for fiscal from million for fiscal average total client and correspondent receivables increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to the datek merger 
average segregated cash increased by percent in fiscal from fiscal  due primarily to the datek merger 
the increased interest income resulting from the higher client and correspondent receivables and segregated cash was partially offset by a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate charged on client receivables  a decrease of basis points in the average interest rate earned on segregated cash and an increase of percent in average amounts payable to clients and correspondents in fiscal from fiscal we generally expect net interest revenue to grow as our account base grows 
however  it will also be affected by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in the levels of client margin borrowing and deposits 

table of contents other revenues increased percent to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due primarily to increased account maintenance  clearing and other fee income resulting from the datek merger 
expenses employee compensation and benefits expense increased percent to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal although full time equivalent employees decreased percent to  at the end of fiscal from  at the end of fiscal  the average number of full time equivalent employees during fiscal increased by approximately nine percent compared to fiscal as a result of the datek merger 
we currently expect the number of full time equivalent employees to range between  and  during fiscal  depending on market conditions 
during fiscal  we incurred approximately million of expense for bonuses based on synergies achieved in the datek merger and approximately million of compensation expense for stock appreciation rights sars assumed in the datek merger  due to increases in our stock price and costs of a cash out offer to sar holders during fiscal as of september   there were approximately  sars outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of per share  compared with approximately million sars outstanding at september  due to the variable accounting required for sars  fluctuations in our stock price will cause fluctuations in the related compensation expense in future periods for the remaining sars outstanding 
communications expense increased percent to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  due primarily to increased expense for quotes  market information and telecommunications costs associated with additional accounts and transaction processing volumes resulting from the datek merger 
occupancy and equipment costs decreased one percent to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due to facilities and equipment reductions in existing ameritrade locations  partially offset by facilities added in the datek merger 
depreciation and amortization increased percent to million for fiscal from million for fiscal  due primarily to amortization of intangible assets recorded in the datek merger  partially offset by lower depreciation expense due to the effect of tangible assets that have become fully depreciated 
professional services expense increased percent to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased usage of consulting services during fiscal in connection with the datek merger integration 
interest on borrowings was approximately million for both fiscal and fiscal lower average borrowings on our revolving credit agreement were offset by interest expense associated with the forward contracts on our knight investment in fiscal we had no borrowings outstanding on our revolving credit agreement during fiscal loss gain on disposal of property includes approximately million of gain recognized on the sale leaseback of our kansas city data center facility in fiscal the remaining million of gain on the sale leaseback is being recognized over the five year term of the leaseback in accordance with sale leaseback accounting 
other operating expenses increased percent to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  due primarily to increased clearing  execution and account maintenance expenses resulting from the increased transaction volume and accounts added through the datek merger 
advertising expenses increased percent to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increased level of advertising expenditures was principally due to our introduction of a new suite of products and services and new pricing schedule during the first quarter of fiscal we expect approximately million to million of advertising expenditures for fiscal  depending on market conditions 
restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consist of approximately million in severance costs related to the closing of tradecast and the integration of the datek and ameritrade technology organizations  and approximately million of non cancelable lease costs in connection with the 
table of contents closing of tradecast 
restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consisted of a million impairment charge to reflect the amount by which the carrying value of the tradecast subsidiaries exceeded its estimated fair value 
the impairment loss consisted of million of goodwill and million of property and equipment 
income tax expense was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the effective income tax rate was approximately percent for fiscal we recorded income tax expense in fiscal despite having a pre tax loss before income taxes  due primarily to the nondeductible goodwill component of tradecast impairment charge 
we expect our effective income tax rate for fiscal to be approximately percent 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  net revenues commissions and clearing fees decreased six percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the number of securities transactions processed  as average trades per day decreased percent to  in fiscal from  in fiscal clients averaged approximately trades per account during fiscal  compared to approximately trades per account during fiscal the decreased volume per account was partially offset by a significant increase in client accounts 
we added  core accounts during the fourth quarter of fiscal through our acquisition of national discount brokers corporation ndb and  core accounts during the fourth quarter of fiscal through our merger with datek 
the substantial advertising expenditures made by us during the past few years also contributed to account growth 
client accounts increased to approximately  at september  from approximately  at september  commissions and clearing fees per trade increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was due primarily to the addition of the ndb accounts  which became part of our ameritrade plus product offering  the implementation of a commission structure for our freetrade product offering effective february  for trades in excess of per month and increased option trading by our clients  which generates higher commissions than equity trades 
these increases were partially offset by slightly lower payment for order flow revenues 
net interest revenue decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to a percent decrease in average client and correspondent receivables  a decrease of approximately basis points in the average interest rate charged on such receivables  a decrease of approximately basis points in the average interest rate earned on cash and investments  including cash and investments segregated in compliance with federal regulations  and an increase of percent in average amounts payable to clients and correspondents in fiscal from fiscal these factors were partially offset by an percent increase in average cash and investments  including cash and investments segregated in compliance with federal regulations  and a decrease of approximately basis points in the average interest rate paid on client and correspondent payables in fiscal from fiscal other revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to increased money market fee income  and the implementation during the second half of fiscal of a transaction fee for paper confirmations and a quarterly fee on accounts that do not meet certain minimum levels of trading activity or assets 
in addition  fees charged to third party broker dealers for orders placed through the company s subsidiary  tradecast  licensed order entry software system also contributed to the increase 
expenses employee compensation and benefits expense decreased eight percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to the effect of staff reductions during fiscal although full time equivalent employees increased to  at the end of september from  at the end of 
table of contents september primarily as a result of the datek merger  the average number of full time equivalent employees was percent lower in fiscal than fiscal communications expense decreased percent to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  due primarily to decreased expense for quotes  market information and postage due to lower transaction processing volumes and the implementation of electronic trade confirmations and client statements during fiscal  partially offset by additional communications expenses for tradecast 
occupancy and equipment costs decreased nine percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was due primarily to the effect of our facilities consolidation and related restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partially offset by additional occupancy and equipment costs related to tradecast 
depreciation and amortization decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  due primarily to the discontinuation of goodwill amortization upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on september   and the effect of the facilities consolidation and resulting restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal  partly offset by higher software amortization expense 
professional services expense decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreased usage of marketing and technology consulting services during fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by legal and accounting expenses incurred in connection with the datek merger in fiscal interest on borrowings decreased percent to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  due to the conversion of million of convertible subordinated notes in february and lower average interest rates and borrowings on our revolving credit agreements 
the debt conversion resulted in savings of approximately million annually in cash interest payments on the convertible subordinated notes 
other operating expenses increased six percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the accrual in fiscal of million related to a patent infringement matter  partially offset by lower transaction processing volumes and the implementation of electronic statements and trade confirmations in fiscal advertising expenses decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the reduced level of advertising expenditures was principally due to adverse stock market conditions and lower media costs 
gain on sale of investment in fiscal consists of a gain of approximately million on the sale of preferred stock of epoch partners  inc epoch 
we sold our interest in epoch for approximately million in cash 
restructuring and asset impairment charges in fiscal consisted of a million impairment charge to reflect the amount by which the carrying value of the tradecast subsidiaries exceeded its estimated fair value 
the impairment loss consisted of million of goodwill and million of property and equipment 
restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in fiscal consisted primarily of severance pay and benefits for approximately terminated employees and impairment charges related to a comprehensive facilities consolidation in connection with a reorganization of our corporate and management structure 
offices in fort worth  texas  omaha  nebraska  baltimore  maryland  and purchase  new york were affected by the facilities consolidation 
debt conversion expense in fiscal consisted of million of cash paid to holders of the convertible subordinated notes in connection with the conversion of million of the notes into million shares of common stock  and million of deferred note origination costs written off related to the converted notes 

table of contents income tax expense was million in fiscal compared to income tax benefit of million in fiscal we recorded income tax expense in fiscal despite having a pretax loss before income taxes  due primarily to the nondeductible goodwill component of the tradecast impairment charge 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our liquidity and capital needs primarily through the use of funds generated from operations and from borrowings under our credit agreements 
we have also issued common stock and convertible subordinated notes to finance mergers and acquisitions and for other corporate purposes 
our liquidity needs during fiscal were financed primarily from our earnings and cash on hand 
we also received approximately million of proceeds on a prepaid variable forward contract see prepaid variable forward contract on our million share investment in knight  and approximately million of net proceeds from the sale leaseback of our kansas city data center facility 
we plan to finance our capital and liquidity needs primarily from our earnings and cash on hand 
in addition  we may utilize our revolving credit facility or issue equity or debt securities 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of the stockholders may be reduced  stockholders may experience additional dilution in net book value per share or such equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available if needed on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our services and products  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
dividends from our subsidiaries are another source of liquidity for the holding company 
some of our subsidiaries are subject to requirements of the sec and nasd relating to liquidity  capital standards  and the use of client funds and securities  which limit funds available for the payment of dividends to the holding company 
under the sec s uniform net capital rule rule c under the securities exchange act of  our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain at all times at least the minimum level of net capital required under rule c this minimum net capital level is determined based upon an involved calculation described in rule c that is primarily based on each broker dealer s aggregate debits  which primarily are a function of client margin receivables at our broker dealer subsidiaries 
since our aggregate debits may fluctuate significantly  our minimum net capital requirements may also fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the holding company may make cash capital contributions to broker dealer subsidiaries  if necessary  to meet net capital requirements 
cash flow cash flow activity for fiscal was significantly impacted by the datek acquisition 
as part of the acquisition  the company acquired a substantial amount of cash of datek to be utilized to pay liabilities assumed  as described below 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cash flows from operations was primarily due to a substantial reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and payment of approximately million in income taxes during fiscal  partially offset by higher pre tax income compared to the same period of the previous year 
the large amount of income taxes paid was primarily due to taxes owed by datek resulting from a gain on the distribution of island holding company  inc island stock to datek stockholders prior to the datek merger 
the payment of taxes on the island distribution was funded by a cash holdback amount established in connection with the datek merger 
the reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities includes payments on liabilities assumed in the datek merger  which were also funded by cash acquired in the datek merger 

table of contents cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was due primarily to million of proceeds from the sale leaseback of our kansas city data center facility  partially offset by million of capital expenditures primarily for software development and payments of million to acquire approximately  mydiscountbroker 
com accounts 
the cash provided by investing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of cash acquired in the datek merger 
cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  compared to cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal the financing activities consisted mainly of million of proceeds on the knight prepaid variable forward contracts  million of proceeds from stock option exercises and million of payments received on stockholder loans  partly offset by million of stock repurchases and million of repurchases of our convertible subordinated notes see convertible subordinated notes in fiscal  and million of payments on our revolving credit facility and million of stock repurchases in fiscal loan agreement on december   we entered into a second amended and restated revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement permits borrowings of up to million through december   and is secured primarily by our stock in our subsidiaries and personal property 
the interest rate on borrowings  determined on a monthly basis  initially is equal to the lesser of i the national prime rate or ii one month libor plus percent 
the interest rate is decreased as we achieve certain levels of consolidated net income during the term of the agreement 
at september   the interest rate on the revolving credit agreement would have been percent 
we also pay a commitment fee of percent of the unused borrowings through the maturity date 
we had no outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement at september  and no outstanding indebtedness under the prior revolving credit agreement at september  the revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions  including a minimum net worth requirement  and prohibits the payment of cash dividends to stockholders 
we were in compliance with or obtained waivers for all covenants under the revolving credit agreements for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the agent for our credit facility has agreed in principle to increase the facility to million from the current million and to extend the term through december on substantially the same terms 
convertible subordinated notes in august  we issued million of percent convertible subordinated notes due august  in february  million of our convertible subordinated notes were converted for approximately million shares of common stock and million of cash 
in october  we repurchased and retired approximately million of our convertible subordinated notes for approximately million in cash  resulting in a gain on debt retirement of approximately million 
on october   we redeemed the remaining million of convertible subordinated notes for an amount equal to percent of the principal amount  resulting in a loss on the redemption of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal prepaid variable forward contract during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts the forward contracts with a counterparty with a total notional amount of approximately million on million underlying knight shares 
the forward contracts each contain a zero cost embedded collar on the value of the knight shares  with a weighted average floor price of per share and a weighted average cap price of per share 
at the inception of the forward contracts  we received cash of approximately million  equal to approximately percent of the notional amount 
the forward contracts mature on various dates in fiscal years and at maturity  we may settle the forward contracts in shares of knight or in cash  at our option 
if the market price of the knight stock at maturity is equal to or less than the floor price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive one share of knight or its cash equivalent for each underlying share 
if 
table of contents the market price of the knight stock at maturity is greater than the cap price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive the number of shares of knight or its cash equivalent equal to the ratio of the floor price plus the excess of the market price over the cap price  divided by the market price  for each underlying share 
if the market price at maturity is greater than the floor price but less than or equal to the cap price  the counterparty will be entitled to receive the number of knight shares or its cash equivalent equal to the ratio of the floor price divided by the market price for each underlying share 
regardless of whether the forward contract is settled in knight shares or in cash  we intend to sell the underlying knight shares at maturity 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of million knight shares 
the forward contracts are expected to be perfectly effective hedges against changes in the cash flows associated with the forecasted future sales outside the price ranges of the collars 
accordingly  all changes in the fair value of the embedded collars are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
as of september   the total fair value of the embedded collars was approximately million and was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheet 
the million of cash received on the forward contracts is accounted for as an obligation on the consolidated balance sheet 
we are accreting interest on the obligation to the notional maturity amount of million over the terms of the forward contracts using effective interest rates with a weighted average of approximately percent 
upon settlement of a forward contract  the fair value of the collar and the realized gain or loss on the knight stock delivered to the counterparty or otherwise sold will be reclassified from other comprehensive income into earnings 
stock repurchase program on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock from time to time over a two year period beginning september  during fiscal  we funded our purchases primarily with cash on hand and the proceeds of the knight prepaid variable forward contracts 
we expect to fund any future purchases primarily with operating profits or cash on hand 
through september   we repurchased approximately million shares at a weighted average purchase price of per share 
on october   we announced plans to purchase million shares of our common stock from certain stockholders concurrent with a secondary offering by those stockholders of approximately million shares of their common stock 
we expect to acquire the million shares from the selling stockholders at the net public offering price 
we expect to use cash on hand to fund the purchase 
other contractual obligations we are obligated to pay our chief executive officer ceo million in deferred compensation  adjusted for investment income or losses on the million  pursuant to our employment agreement with the ceo 
our current employment agreement with the ceo ends on march  this payment will be made not sooner than the day after the ceo s employment with the company terminates 
at september  and september   we had an equity index swap arrangement with a notional amount of million for the purpose of hedging our obligation under this deferred compensation plan 
changes in the fair value of this instrument are equally offset by changes in our obligation to our ceo 
we also have contractual obligations under operating leases for facilities and equipment 
the following table summarizes future payments under our contractual obligations

we redeemed all of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of these notes on october  on november   we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire bidwell company 
in connection with this purchase we expect to pay approximately million in cash and the transaction is expected to close in early  subject to applicable regulatory approvals

risk factors stock market volatility and other securities industry risks have adversely affected our business 
substantially all of our revenues are derived from securities brokerage and clearing and execution services 
like other securities brokerage businesses  we are directly affected by economic and political conditions  broad trends in business and finance and changes in volume and price levels of securities transactions 
we are particularly affected by volatility in technology and internet related stocks because significant numbers of our clients invest in these types of stocks 
since may  the us securities markets have been very volatile  which has reduced trading volume and net revenues 
the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   the invasion of iraq in and other events also resulted in substantial market volatility and accompanying reductions in trading volume and net revenues 
in addition  any general economic downturn would adversely affect trading volumes and net revenues 
for example  in we experienced reduced trading volumes and net revenues that adversely affected our profitability 
severe market fluctuations or weak economic conditions could reduce our trading volume and net revenues and adversely affect our profitability 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly 
our common stock  and the us securities markets in general  have experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years 
the market prices of securities of internet related companies  in particular  have been especially volatile 
the price of our common stock could decrease substantially 
in addition  because the market price of our common stock tends to fluctuate significantly  we may become the object of securities class action litigation which may result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
substantial competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
the market for electronic brokerage services is young  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
we expect the competitive environment to continue in the future 
we face direct competition from numerous online brokerage firms  including charles schwab co  inc  e trade group  inc  td waterhouse group  inc  harrisdirect and scottrade  inc 
we also encounter competition from the broker dealer affiliates of established full commission brokerage firms as well as from financial institutions  mutual fund sponsors and other organizations  some of which provide online brokerage services 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  offer a wider range of services and financial products  and have greater name recognition and a more extensive client base than we do 
we believe that the general financial success of companies within the online securities industry will continue to attract new competitors to the industry  such as banks  software development companies  insurance companies  providers of online financial information and others 
these companies may provide a more comprehensive suite of services than we do 
in addition  our clearing operations compete with numerous firms that provide clearing and execution services to the securities industry 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
systems failures and delays could harm our business 
we receive and process trade orders through a variety of electronic channels  including the internet  wireless web  personal digital assistants and our interactive voice response system 
these methods of trading are heavily dependent on the integrity of the electronic systems supporting them 
our systems and operations

though all of our core computer systems and applications are fully redundant and distributed over two sites  it may take up to four hours to restore full functionality in the event of an unforeseen disaster 
extraordinary trading volumes could cause our computer systems to operate at an unacceptably low speed or even fail 
while we have invested significant amounts in the last few years to upgrade the reliability and scalability of our systems  there can be no assurance that our systems will be sufficient to handle such extraordinary trading volumes 
in the past  we experienced periods of extremely high trading volume that caused individual system components or processes to fail  resulting in the temporary unavailability of our web site for online trading and delays in our telephone systems 
on some other occasions  high trading volume caused significant delays in executing trading orders  resulting in some clients orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate 
from time to time  we have reimbursed our clients for losses incurred in connection with systems failures and delays 
we are also subject to a putative class action lawsuit regarding claimed systems failures and delays 
systems failures and delays may occur again in the future and could cause  among other things  unanticipated disruptions in service to our clients  slower system response time resulting in transactions not being processed as quickly as our clients desire  decreased levels of client service and client satisfaction  and harm to our reputation 
if any of these events were to occur  we could suffer a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of our client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or other client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
capacity constraints of our systems could harm our business 
if our business increases  we may need to expand and upgrade our transaction processing systems  network infrastructure and other aspects of our technology 
many of our systems are  and much of our infrastructure is  designed to accommodate additional growth without redesign or replacement  however  we may need to continue to make significant investments in additional hardware and software to accommodate growth 
we may not be able to project accurately the rate  timing or cost of any increases in our business  or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner 
failure to make necessary expansions and upgrades to our systems and infrastructure could lead to failures and delays  which could cause a loss of clients or a reduction in the growth of the client base  increased operating expenses  financial losses  additional litigation or client claims  and regulatory sanctions or additional regulatory burdens 
regulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business 
the securities industry is subject to extensive regulation and broker dealers are subject to regulations covering all aspects of the securities business 
the sec  nasd and other self regulatory organizations and state and foreign regulators can  among other things  censure  fine  issue cease and desist orders to  suspend or expel a broker dealer or any of its officers or employees 
while we neither actively solicit new accounts nor have established offices outside the united states and canada  our websites are accessible worldwide over the internet and we currently have account holders located outside the united states and canada 
these accounts make up approximately of our accounts and our spread across many jurisdictions 
any adverse action by foreign regulators with respect to regulatory compliance by us in foreign jurisdictions could adversely effect our revenues from clients in such country or region 
our ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our internal system to ensure compliance  as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
we could be subject to disciplinary or other actions in the future due to claimed noncompliance  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and profitability 

table of contents in august  nasd directed our broker dealer subsidiaries  iclearing llc and ameritrade  inc  to cease permitting cash account clients to utilize the proceeds from the sale of fully paid for securities to purchase other securities in advance of the actual receipt of proceeds from the settlement of the sale of the fully paid for securities the specified trades 
nasd is conducting an investigation related to the specified trades 
nasd staff has advised that it has made a preliminary determination to recommend disciplinary action against ameritrade  inc  datek online financial services  llc and iclearing based on allegations that the specified trades violated regulation t of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and nasd conduct rules 
if nasd elects to bring disciplinary proceedings  nasd may seek censures  fines  suspensions or other sanctions 
we are discussing possible settlement with nasd 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
an adverse resolution could harm our business 
recently  various regulatory and enforcement agencies have been reviewing mutual fund trading  regulatory reporting obligations  best execution practices  and advertising claims as they relate to the brokerage industry 
these reviews could result in enforcement actions or new regulations  which could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  we use the internet as a major distribution channel to provide services to our clients 
a number of regulatory agencies have recently adopted regulations regarding client privacy and the use of client information by service providers 
additional laws and regulations relating to the internet may be adopted in the future  including regulations regarding the pricing  taxation  content and quality of products and services delivered over the internet 
complying with these laws and regulations is expensive and time consuming and could limit our ability to use the internet as a distribution channel 
the success of our business will depend on continued development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and amount of traffic 
our success will depend upon the development and maintenance of the internet s infrastructure to cope with this increased traffic 
the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays as a result of damage to portions of its infrastructure and could face similar outages and delays in the future 
outages and delays are likely to affect the level of internet usage and the processing of transactions on our web site 
in addition  the internet could lose its viability due to delays in the development or adoption of new standards to handle increased levels of activity 
our principal stockholders own a significant percentage of our common stock  which limits the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters 
j 
joe ricketts  our chairman and founder  members of his family and trusts held for their benefit collectively  the ricketts holders own approximately of our common stock and investment funds affiliated with bain capital  silver lake partners and ta associates collectively  the datek holders collectively own approximately of our common stock 
the ricketts holders and the datek holders are parties to a stockholders agreement  which terminates in  that obligates the parties to vote their shares in favor of a board of directors  of which three are to be designated by the ricketts holders  three are to be designated by the datek holders and three are to be independent directors selected with the agreement of the parties 
the agreement also obligates the parties to vote in favor of specified merger and sale of the company transactions that are approved by the requisite directors and to vote against specified merger and sale of the company transactions unless they are approved by the requisite directors 
accordingly  these stockholders have significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matters submitted to our stockholders for approval  including the election of directors  mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets  and also could prevent or cause a change in control 
the interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of other stockholders 
in addition  third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of ownership or the provisions of the stockholders agreement 

table of contents the terms of the stockholders agreement  our charter documents and delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in the stockholders agreement among the ricketts holders and the datek holders  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law will make it difficult for any party to acquire control of us in a transaction not approved by the requisite number of directors 
these provisions include the presence of a classified board of directors  the ability of the board of directors to issue and determine the terms of preferred stock  advance notice requirements for inclusion of stockholder proposals at stockholder meetings  and the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these provisions could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that might provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
we will need to introduce new products and services to remain competitive 
our future success depends in part on our ability to develop and enhance our products and services 
there are significant technical and financial risks in the development of new or enhanced products and services  including the risk that we will be unable to effectively use new technologies or adapt our services to emerging industry standards  or develop  introduce and market enhanced or new products and services 
in addition  the adoption of new internet  networking or telecommunications technologies or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our services or infrastructure 
changes in payments for routing our clients orders could adversely affect our business 
we have arrangements with several execution agents to receive cash payments in exchange for routing trade orders to these firms for execution 
competition between execution agents and the implementation of order handling rules and decimalization of stock prices have made it less profitable for execution agents to offer order flow payments to broker dealers 
on a per trade basis  our payment for order flow revenue has decreased significantly over the past several years 
these payments may continue to decrease on a per trade basis  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
our networks may be vulnerable to security risks 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations 
we have not experienced significant network security problems in the past 
however  our networks may in the future be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other security problems 
persons who circumvent security measures could wrongfully use our confidential information or our clients confidential information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches 
we may not be able to implement security measures that will protect against all security risks 
failure to comply with net capital requirements could adversely affect our business 
the sec  nasd and various other regulatory agencies have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers 
net capital is a measure  defined by the sec  of a broker dealer s readily available liquid assets  reduced by its total liabilities other than approved subordinated debt 
all of our broker dealer subsidiaries are required to comply with the net capital requirements 
if we fail to maintain the required net capital  the sec could suspend or revoke our registration  or nasd could expel us from membership  which could ultimately lead to our liquidation 
if the net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to maintain or expand our business 

table of contents our clearing operations expose us to liability for errors in clearing functions 
ameritrade  inc provides clearing and execution services to each of our brokerage businesses  as well as to independent broker dealers  depository institutions  registered investment advisors and financial planners 
clearing and execution services include the confirmation  receipt  settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions 
clearing brokers also assume direct responsibility for the possession and control of client securities and other assets and the clearance of client securities transactions 
self clearing securities firms are subject to substantially more regulatory control and examination than brokers that rely on others to perform those functions 
errors in performing clearing functions  including clerical and other errors related to the handling of funds and securities held by us on behalf of clients and introducing brokers  could lead to civil penalties imposed by applicable authorities as well as losses and liability in related lawsuits brought by clients and others 
we are exposed to credit risk 
we make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities and periodically borrow and lend securities to cover trades 
a significant portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans 
to the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us  we must obtain financing from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts 
by permitting clients to purchase securities on margin  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit  especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral held by us could fall below the amount of a client s indebtedness 
in addition  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders 
sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
acquisitions involve risks that could adversely affect our business 
we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
acquisitions may entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of acquired operations  services and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  assumption of unknown material liabilities of acquired companies  amortization of acquired intangible assets  which could reduce future reported earnings  potential loss of clients or key employees of acquired companies  and dilution to existing stockholders 
as part of our growth strategy  we regularly consider  and from time to time engage in discussions and negotiations regarding  strategic transactions such as acquisitions  mergers and combinations  within our industry 
the purchase price for possible acquisitions may be paid in cash  through the issuance of common stock or other of our securities  borrowings or a combination of these methods 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to identify and to consummate strategic transactions and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing  likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction 
for example  in many cases we begin negotiations that we subsequently decide to suspend or terminate for a variety of reasons 
however  opportunities may arise from time to time that we will evaluate 
any transactions that we consummate would involve risks and uncertainties to us 
these risks could cause the failure of any anticipated benefits of an acquisition to be realized  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations 
we do not hold any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we seek to control the risks associated with our client activities by requiring clients to maintain margin collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
we monitor required margin levels daily and  pursuant to such guidelines  require our clients to deposit additional collateral  or to reduce positions  when necessary 
as a fundamental part of our brokerage business  we hold short term interest earning assets  mainly funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations for clients 
these funds totaled billion at september  and billion at september  we invest these funds in repurchase agreements  short term fixed rate us treasury bills and other qualified securities 
our interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities  totaling billion at september  and billion at september   in the form of client cash balances 
we earn a net interest spread on the difference between amounts earned on client margin loans and amounts paid on client credit balances 
because we establish the rate paid on client cash balances and the rate charged on client margin balances  a substantial portion of our interest rate risk is under our direct management 
at september  and september   we had million and million  respectively  of convertible subordinated notes outstanding  which bore interest at a fixed rate of percent 
we had no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit agreement  which bears interest at a floating rate  as of september  and september  we hold two marketable equity securities  our investments in approximately million shares of knight and  shares of the nasdaq stock market  inc  which were recorded at fair value of million million net of tax at september  and have exposure to market price risk 
the same securities were recorded at fair value of million million net of tax at september  the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent adverse change in prices quoted by the stock exchanges was approximately million at september  during fiscal  we entered into a series of prepaid variable forward contracts with a total notional amount of approximately million on million underlying knight shares 
the forward contracts each contain an embedded collar on the value of the knight shares  with a weighted average floor price of per share and a weighted average cap price of per share 
we have designated the forward contracts as cash flow hedges of the forecasted future sales of million knight shares 
as of september   the fair value of the embedded collars was approximately million and was included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the forward contracts are expected to be perfectly effective hedges against changes in cash flows associated with changes in the value of knight shares outside the price ranges of the collars 
at september  and september   we had an equity index swap arrangement with a notional amount of million for the purpose of hedging our obligation under our deferred compensation plan for our ceo 
changes in the fair value of this instrument are offset by changes in our obligation to our ceo 
our revenues and financial instruments are denominated in us dollars  and we generally do not invest  except for hedging purposes  in derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments
