these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our results to be materially different from results implied in such forward looking statements 
those risks include  among others  risks associated with the apparel industry  the dependence on senior management  maintaining sufficient working capital financing  price pressures and other competitive factors and a softening of retailer or consumer acceptance of the company s products leading to a decrease in anticipated revenues and gross profit margins 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies relate to estimates related to allowances for uncollectible receivables  customer sales allowances and valuation of inventories 
receivables allowances are provided for estimated uncollectible receivables based on review of specific accounts and historical experience 
allowances and credits  which are given to customers in connection with sales incentives and promotional activities  are recognized as reductions of sales when the related sales revenue is earned and recognized 
events or changes in market conditions that adversely impact our customers or the company s ability to generate sales  could impact management s estimates of uncollectible receivables or require the company to offer greater sales incentives  which could negatively impact sales or profits in the future 
as of december   the company has allowances for bad debts of approximately  and reserves for sales allowances of  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  by the first in  first out method  or market 
in assessing the market value of its inventories  particularly those with slower turnover  the company considers the estimated sales value less costs to dispose and a reasonable profit margin and assesses the likelihood of realizing the recorded amounts of inventory 
changes in market conditions could impact the company s ability to achieve sales at the estimated selling prices and could negatively impact the carrying value of the company s inventory 
valuation of deferred tax assets deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
management makes an annual assessment of the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets 
in making this assessment  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities and projected future taxable income of the company in making this assessment 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the total deferred income tax assets to its net realizable value 
at december   the company s deferred tax assets related primarily to a us net operating loss carryforward of million which can be utilized over the next eighteen years 
based on the company s recent operating results and projections of future profitability  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income to recover million of its deferred tax assets 
the recovery of the remaining net deferred tax assets is significantly less certain and  accordingly  the company has established a valuation allowance for the balance of its deferred tax assets of million 
if future taxable income is less than management s estimates  the amount of the net deferred tax assets on the company s consolidated balance sheet will require an additional valuation allowance 
additionally  if the company is able to realize higher taxable income the valuation allowance could be reduced
