restructuring and other expense in november of fiscal year  an electronics facility in france was sold as committed in the june restructuring plan 
with this sale  the company has completed all actions relating to the june restructuring plan 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan comprised of incremental cost scaling actions to more closely align the company s operating capacities and capabilities with reduced demand levels related to the prolonged nature of the global economic slowdown in many of the company s markets and the resulting continuation of underutilized manufacturing capacity within both of the company s segments 
overall scaling actions include the consolidation of capabilities and operations  selling and or exiting redundant facilities  aligning personnel costs and adjusting assets associated with scaling actions to their current fair values 
the company is executing the restructuring plan and expects restructuring activities to be substantially complete within months of the plan inception which is three months ahead of the original schedule 
as a result of the above outlined activities  the company incurred a pre tax restructuring charge of million in fiscal year included in the fiscal year restructuring charge is million for asset write downs  million for employee transition and other employee costs  and million for plant closure and other exit costs 
unrelated to the above described restructuring plan  in the second quarter of fiscal year the company recorded a pre tax charge of million for asset impairment within the furniture and cabinets segment to align the carrying values of long lived assets at the company s veneer operations with their fair values 
this charge is included on the restructuring and other line of the consolidated statements of income 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding restructuring and other charges 
based on costs incurred to date and the latest cost estimates  the company estimates total pre tax restructuring and other costs to be approximately million  as compared to the original estimate of million 
the decrease is primarily due to lower employee transition and other employee costs in addition to lower plant closure and other exit costs 
management estimates that once the restructuring actions are completed  they will reduce the company s total cost structure by approximately to million on an annualized pre tax basis  with part of the savings to be redeployed into strategic initiatives designed to accelerate sales growth  and improve quality and efficiencies 
as originally estimated  cost savings are being realized gradually and management expects to continue to realize additional cost savings resulting from the restructuring activities as the actions are completed 
the preceding statements are forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to certain risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  successful execution of the restructuring plan  a significant change in economic conditions  loss of key customers or suppliers within specific industries  or similar unforeseen events 
results of operations discussion fiscal year consolidated net sales decreased from a year ago as decreased sales in the company s furniture and cabinets segment more than offset increased sales in the company s electronic contract assemblies segment 
fiscal year consolidated net income declined compared to the prior fiscal year as furniture and cabinets segment net earnings declined as compared to a year ago at a faster pace than net income in the electronic contract assemblies segment increased over the prior year 
furniture and cabinets segment product line offerings included in the furniture and cabinets segment are office furniture  residential furniture and hospitality and healthcare furniture  all sold under the company s family of brand names 
other products produced within this segment on a contract basis include television cabinets and stands  residential furniture  office furniture and retail infrastructure products 
forest products formerly furniture components are primarily sold to outside customers and are used in certain end products of the company 
the company s production flexibility allows it to utilize portions of the available production capacity created by lower volumes within these product lines to support and balance increased production schedules of other product lines within this segment 
the furniture and cabinets segment s net sales for fiscal year declined when compared to the prior fiscal year as increased sales of forest products and hospitality and healthcare furniture were offset by sales reductions in the other major product lines in the current year as well as the sale of the boesendorfer piano subsidiary  which was sold in fiscal year current year net sales in the office furniture product line decreased from the sales volumes recorded in fiscal year due to an overall decline in demand within the office furniture industry 
a prior year list price increase was partially offset by increased price discounting in fiscal year driven by continued pricing pressures in the soft office furniture markets 
open orders at june  were higher than open orders at june hospitality and healthcare product line sales increased in fiscal year from the previous year as the industry has experienced modest growth 
sales mix of standard product offerings  which generally carry a higher margin  increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  however  the recent quarterly trend shows a sales mix shift towards custom product 
open orders at june  were higher than open orders at june  fiscal year contract manufacturing net sales declined from the prior year 
within this product line  sales of large screen projection television cabinets produced on a contract basis remained relatively flat  while sales of contract furniture decreased when compared to the prior year 
at june   open orders for the contract manufacturing product line were less than open orders at june  net sales in the forest products product line increased significantly in fiscal year  compared to the prior year 
increased sales of lumber and veneer products more than offset the decreased sales of dimension products  which were down as a result of the company s election to exit two wood dimension manufacturing facilities during the second quarter of fiscal year open orders for forest products as of june  were higher than open orders as of june  the furniture and cabinets segment produced a net loss in fiscal year  compared to the net income realized in fiscal due to lower sales volumes and resulting operating inefficiencies 
when excluding current and prior fiscal year after tax restructuring activity and other costs of million and million respectively  and a prior year after tax gain of million associated with the sale of the piano subsidiary  the segment still recorded a net loss in the current year as compared to net income in the prior year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on restructuring and other charges 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  decreased from fiscal primarily due to production inefficiencies caused in part by lower volume levels and higher material costs  as a percent of sales 
material costs  as a percent of net sales  increased in fiscal year compared to a year ago in part due to a fiscal year benefit from a liquidation of lifo last in  first out inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years  the effect of which increased net income by approximately million or per class b share 
higher material costs  as a percent of net sales  within the forest products product line in the current year were also a contributing factor to the higher segment material costs  as a percent of sales 
labor and overhead costs  as a percent of sales  increased slightly in fiscal year over the prior year as the reduction in sales outpaced labor and overhead cost reductions 
furniture and cabinet segment fiscal year selling  general  and administrative spending decreased in absolute dollars and as a percent of net sales from the prior year reflecting the company s efforts to align its cost structure with declining sales 
fiscal year net losses in the forest products product line  which totaled million  or per class b diluted share  inclusive of million  or per share relating to after tax restructuring and other charges  continue to affect overall segment profitability 
however  improvement within the forest products product line is evident exclusive of restructuring and other charges as losses improved in the latter half of fiscal due to continued operating efficiency improvements  the exit of the wood dimension operations in the second quarter of fiscal  and the exit of the face veneer operation early in the fourth quarter of fiscal improvement in this product line is dependent upon the company achieving its planned higher volume levels and associated improvements in operating efficiencies 
the contract manufacturing product line produced a net loss in fiscal year  which is a decline from the net income realized in fiscal year in part due to depressed and unstable demand levels in the markets it supports leading to pricing pressures and production inefficiencies 
risk factors within this segment include  but are not limited to  general economic and market conditions  increased global competition  and relationships with strategic customers and product distributors 
additional risk factors that could have an effect on the company s performance are located on page electronic contract assemblies segment net sales for fiscal year surpassed the prior year by in the electronic contract assemblies segment

sales to this customer accounted for of the total sales in the electronic contract assemblies segment in both fiscal years and trw automotive in turn sells complete braking assemblies  in part manufactured by the company  to several major automotive companies  most with multiple braking assembly programs that span multiple vehicles  which partially mitigates the company s exposure to a single customer 
the nature of the contract electronics manufacturing industry is such that the start up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently 
new customer and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program  which are generally recovered as the program matures and becomes established 
despite the current year improvement  this segment continues to experience margin pressures related to an overall excess capacity position in the electronics subcontracting services market and more specifically this segment s new customer and program diversification efforts 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company purchased an electronics manufacturing facility located in auburn  indiana from siemens vdo 
in the first quarter of fiscal  the company sold an electronics facility in france and in the third quarter of fiscal year  the company sold a microelectronics facility in california

overhead costs  as a percent of sales  increased in fiscal year over the prior year as the reduction in sales outpaced cost reductions 
also contributing to the improved margins in this segment in fiscal year  compared to the prior year  were inventory reduction initiatives that resulted in a liquidation of lifo last in  first out inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years  the effect of which increased net income by approximately million or per class b share 
the forest products product line continued to negatively affect the profitability in this segment as fiscal bottom line results were impacted by the significant sales volume reduction in dimension and lumber products compared to the prior year 
market conditions within the forest products product line remained very challenging based on depressed demand levels and pressures on lumber and veneer commodity prices due  in part  to excess capacity within this market 
gross profit at the company s projection television cabinet operation in juarez  mexico improved slightly in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  despite a lower sales volume

sales of medical components and industrial controls in fiscal also increased over the prior year while sales of telecommunication and computer related products declined compared to fiscal the contract electronics manufacturing industry in general has been faced with excess capacity due to the slowing economy 
the company has not been immune and continually evaluates its operations as to the most optimum capacity and service levels by geographic region 
net income of million in fiscal year increased over fiscal year net income of million  when including fiscal after tax restructuring income of million and fiscal after tax restructuring expense of million  and a fiscal after tax charge of million for impaired goodwill unrelated to the restructuring 
operations from the new auburn facility contributed to the net income increase 
the after tax restructuring income of million recorded in fiscal was related primarily to adjustments to original cost estimates 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  declined in fiscal year from the prior year  largely related to operational inefficiencies on the production of new products primarily at the company s poznan  poland operation 
the fiscal auburn facility acquisition provided positive bottom line contribution along with new product and customer diversification

allowance for sales returns at the time revenue is recognized certain provisions may also be recorded  including returns and allowances  which involve estimates based on current discussions with applicable customers  historical experience with a particular customer and or product  and other relevant factors 
as such  these factors may change over time causing the provisions to be adjusted accordingly 
at june  and june  the reserve for returns and allowances was million and million  respectively

fifo inventory recorded on the company s balance sheet is adjusted for excess and obsolete inventory 
in general  the company purchases materials for contract based business from customer orders and projections  primarily in the case of long lead time items  and has a general philosophy to only purchase materials to the extent covered by a written commitment from its customers 
however  there are times when inventory is purchased beyond customer commitments where minimal lot sizes  component allocation or other component procurement issues may exist 
evaluation of excess inventory includes such factors as anticipated usage  inventory turnover  inventory levels  and product demand levels 
factors considered when evaluating inventory obsolescence include the age of on hand inventory and reduction in value due to damage  use as showroom samples  design changes or cessation of product lines 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for auto and general liability  workers compensation and certain employee health benefits including medical  short term disability and dental with the related liabilities included in the accompanying financial statements 
the company s policy is to estimate reserves based upon periodic actuarial valuations  and known or estimated future claims 
the company uses independent outside actuaries to assist in the valuation of medical reserves on an annual basis and on a bi annual basis for workers compensation 
actuarial studies support the development of claim growth factors  including factors for incurred but not reported claims  which are then applied to the company s actual claims history 
the actuarial valuations are based on historical information along with certain assumptions about future events 
the company adjusts its reserve levels to align with these periodic independent actuarial studies 
changes in assumptions for such matters as increased medical costs and changes in actual experience could cause these estimates to change and reserve levels to be adjusted accordingly
