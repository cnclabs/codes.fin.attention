item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a rapidly growing specialty retailer offering a vast selection of arts  crafts and floral merchandise to a broad demographic of consumers 
our target customers are primarily women between the ages of and who are looking for ideas to decorate their homes  create handmade items  or otherwise engage in arts and crafts activities 
we have grown from stores in january to stores in december our stores are located in the eastern united states from new england to the carolinas 
we established our first store in moorestown  new jersey in and grew to five stores by the end of we added a total of additional stores in and in  we began implementing an aggressive expansion plan and built our infrastructure to position us for that growth 
by the end of  we had recruited experienced senior retail executives in the areas of operations  merchandising and finance  and made key additions and changes in other areas such as buying  information systems  human resources and real estate 
from through we continued to strengthen and expand our management team including the addition of lawrence h 
fine as our president in june we also continued to develop our operating systems  the most important of which was our pos system implemented in august in  we leased a new  square foot distribution center and office complex in suburban philadelphia  which was expanded to  square feet in we also developed an automated ordering system using edi to link us electronically with most of our vendors and developed a real estate program to accommodate our expansion plan 
in  we received financing for our growth through an initial public offering of our common stock with net proceeds  after the payment of outstanding debt  of approximately million 
in and  we continued implementing our expansion strategy by opening a total of new stores 
in we did not meet our profit objectives 
as a result  in  we made a decision to concentrate on improving the profitability of our existing store base and to open only three stores 
we revamped our store opening procedures  prepared our systems for further expansion  and strengthened our merchandising with improved communication between our store management and our buyers 
with the changes we made in  we re established our expansion plan and opened ten new stores in  new stores in and new stores in in we closed two stores  one was destroyed by fire and the other was in an area which had negative demographic changes and the lease had expired 
during the next two years  we intend to increase our store base by approximately per year  all within miles of our suburban philadelphia distribution center  an area encompassing approximately of the united states population 
we believe we can operate at least stores in this area without significantly diluting sales in our existing stores 
to accommodate this growth  we are in the process of negotiating the construction of a new distribution center to replace our existing facility 
the new distribution center will be  square feet plus  square feet of office space and will be located near our existing facility

income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for and for quarterly results and seasonality the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly operating results for our eight most recent quarterly periods and the number of stores open at the end of each period dollars in thousands  except share and store data 
first second third fourth first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter net sales         cost of sales         gross margin         selling  general and administrative         pre opening expense  income loss from operations     interest expense income  net income loss before income taxes     income tax expense benefit   net income loss   net income loss per share  diluted 
diluted average shares outstanding         number of stores open at end of period comparable store sales increase due to the importance of our peak selling season  which includes fall halloween  thanksgiving and christmas  the fourth quarter has historically contributed  and is expected to continue to contribute  virtually all of our profitability for the entire year 
as a result  any factors negatively affecting us during the fourth quarter of any year  including adverse weather and unfavorable economic conditions  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the entire year 
our quarterly results of operations also may fluctuate based upon such factors as the length of holiday seasons  the date on which holidays fall  the number and timing of new store openings  the amount of store pre opening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the amount of sales returns  the timing and level of markdowns and other competitive factors 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing merchandise trends and consumer demands 
accordingly  any delay or failure by us in identifying and correctly responding to changing merchandise trends and consumer demand could adversely affect consumer acceptance of the merchandise in our stores 
in addition  we make decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of each of the seasons in which such merchandise will be sold 
significant deviations from projected demand for merchandise would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  either from lost sales due to insufficient inventory or lower margins due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
liquidity and capital resources our cash is used primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and fixtures and equipment  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores 
in recent years  we have financed our operations and new store openings primarily with cash from operations  the net proceeds we received from our initial public offering in and with borrowings under bank financing agreements 
in march we completed a secondary offering in which we sold  new post split shares  with net cash proceeds of  at december  and  our working capital was million and million  respectively 
during  and  cash of million  million and million was generated by operations  respectively 
in these three periods  million  million and million of cash  respectively  was used to increase inventory levels to support both new and existing stores 
in these periods  part of the inventory increase was financed through increases in accounts payable of million  million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
this use of cash was for capital expenditures 
in and  capital expenditures related principally to new store openings 
in  capital expenditures related principally to new store openings and the implementation of the pos system 
in  we expect to spend approximately million on capital expenditures  which includes approximately million for land  building  equipment and systems for our new distribution center  million for new store openings  and the remainder for remodeling existing stores  upgrading systems in existing stores  warehouse equipment and corporate systems development 
the total cost of the new distribution center is estimated to be in the range of million 
we expect to finance two thirds of this project through long term debt 
in the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was principally the million proceeds from our sale of shares in march in the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million  principally as a result of million of proceeds received from equipment financing 
on july  we signed a new million one year line of credit agreement with first union national bank 
with the successful completion of the sale of shares in march  we no longer required the existing million revolving credit agreement which contained several restrictive covenants and was more expensive to maintain 
borrowing under this new line will bear interest at libor plus basis points 
we believe the cash generated from operations during the year  funds received through the financing of the new distribution center and available borrowings under the new financing agreement will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditures requirements for at least the next months 
we lease our retail stores  distribution center  satellite warehouse facilities  and corporate headquarters under noncancelable operating leases 
at december  our total obligations under these operating leases were million 
in addition  we had capital lease obligations of million at december  the following table reflects as of december  the payments due for the periods indicated under our capital and operating leases 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations   operating leases      general on june   our board of directors approved a two for one stock split to shareholders of record as of the close of business on july  the shares were distributed on july  critical accounting policies our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included herein 
as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results may differ from those estimates 
management makes adjustments to its assumptions and judgments when facts and circumstances dictate 
the amounts currently estimated by us are subject to change if different assumptions as to the outcome of future events were made 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicate those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  encompass the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at point of retail sale 
merchandise inventories we value our inventories at stores at the lower of cost or market as determined using the retail inventory method 
because we do not have perpetual inventory records for inventory in our stores  we perform complete physical inventories in each of our stores at the end of each year 
the actual physical count of merchandise is made principally by third party inventory counting service firms 
inventory valuation methods also require certain management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of net realizable value on product designated for clearance or on slow moving merchandise 
the accuracy of our estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside of our control  including changes in economic conditions and consumer buying trends 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences in our estimates of recovery compared with actual results 
we believe our process results in reasonable estimates of our retail inventory on hand at year end 
advertising costs the costs incurred for advertising are expensed the first time the advertising takes place  and are offset by re imbursements received under cooperative advertising programs with certain vendors 
co op advertising funds are only recognized when we have performed our contractual obligation under a co op advertising agreement 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically review long lived assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of assets with their estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
to the extent these future estimates change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from our current estimates  and the loss  if any  would be recognized at that time 
the impairment loss is calculated as the difference between assets carrying values and the present value of estimated net cash flows or comparable market values  giving consideration to recent operating performance and pricing trends 
income taxes we do business in various jurisdictions that impose income taxes 
management determines the aggregate amount of income tax expense to accrue and the amount currently payable based upon the tax statutes of each jurisdiction 
this process involves adjusting income determined using generally accepted accounting principles for items that are treated differently by the applicable taxing authorities 
deferred tax liabilities are reflected on our balance sheet for temporary differences that will reverse in subsequent years 
if different judgments had been made  our tax expense  assets and liabilities could have been different 
other estimates management uses estimates in the determination of the required accruals for general liability  workers compensation  and health insurance 
these estimates are based upon examination of historical trends  industry claims experience and  in certain cases  calculations performed by third party experts 
projected claims information may change in the future and may require management to revise these accruals 
we are periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential range of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each legal action 
our accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
inflation deflation management does not believe that inflation or deflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations during the past three years 
recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires the recognition of a liability for the estimated cost of disposal as part of the initial cost of a long lived asset 
we must adopt sfas in we believe that adopting this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april 
sfas among other things  rescinds various pronouncements regarding early extinguishment of debt 
it allows extraordinary accounting treatment for early extinguishment of debt only when the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no

sfas provisions regarding early extinguishment of debt are generally effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we adopted this statement effective january  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb  issued sfas  no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
we must adopt sfas for all exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not believe that adopting this pronouncement will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in november  the eitf reached consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
eitf issue addresses the accounting for cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor eg  slotting fees  cooperative advertising payments  buydowns and rebates or refunds from a vendor that is payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified time period 
eitf issue is effective for agreements modified or entered into after january  we are currently evaluating the impact of eitf issue  and have not determined whether or not the adoption of the provisions of eitf issue will have a material impact on our consolidated operating results or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
it also amends apb opinion no

fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements for periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we have determined that no additional disclosures are required for this form k issued for the year ended december   and the adoption of the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements issued after january  the initial recognition provisions of fin are applicable immediately to new variable interests in variable interest entities created after january  for a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february   the initial recognition provisions of fin are to be implemented no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we have determined that we do not have any variable interests in any variable interest entities 
therefore  no disclosure is required for this form k issued for the fiscal year ended december  and the adoption of the initial recognition provisions of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
