discontinued operations on june   we completed the spin off of our optical medical device business to our stockholders 
the optical medical device business consisted of two businesses our ophthalmic surgical products business  which developed  manufactured and marketed products that included artificial lenses for the eye  called intraocular lenses  and equipment for cataract and refractive eye surgery  and our contact lens care products business  which developed  manufactured and marketed a broad range of products for use with every available type of contact lens 
the spin off was effected by contributing our optical medical device business to a newly formed subsidiary  advanced medical optics  inc  and issuing a dividend of advanced medical optics common stock to our stockholders 
the internal revenue service ruled that the transaction qualified as tax free for allergan and our stockholders for us federal income tax purposes  with the exception of cash received for fractional shares 
the common stock of advanced medical optics began trading publicly on the new york stock exchange on july  under the symbol avo 
as a result of the spin off  we continue to own and operate our specialty pharmaceutical business  and advanced medical optics owns and operates what was formerly our optical medical device business 
our consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained herein have been recast to reflect the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of advanced medical optics as a discontinued operation 
we did not account for our ophthalmic surgical and contact lens care businesses as a separate legal entity

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
liquidity and capital resources management assesses our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund our operations 
significant factors in the management of liquidity are funds generated by operations  levels of accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and capital expenditures  the extent of our stock repurchase program  adequate credit facilities  and financial flexibility to attract long term capital on satisfactory terms 
historically  we have generated cash from operations in excess of working capital requirements 
the net cash provided by continuing operations was million in compared to million in and million in operating cash flow from continuing operations decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in earnings from continuing operations  including the effect of non cash items  which were negatively affected principally by the lumigan legal settlement charge and duplicate operating costs associated with the spin off of advanced medical optics

operating cash flow from continuing operations increased in compared to primarily as a result of the increase in earnings from continuing operations  including the effect of non cash items 
the increased cash outflow in other current and non current assets related to various collaborations and other miscellaneous receivables  which were offset by a decrease in cash used for trade receivables in compared to additionally  the increased cash outflow in accrued expenses and other liabilities was primarily the result of our contributions in to our us pension plan of approximately million compared to million in net cash used in investing activities was million in  including million in expenditures for plant and equipment  more fully described under capital expenditures below  and million to acquire software

we maintain an evergreen stock repurchase program 
our evergreen stock repurchase program authorizes management to repurchase our common stock for the primary purpose of funding our stock based benefit plans 
under the stock repurchase program  we may maintain up million repurchased shares in our treasury account at any one time 
as of december   we held approximately million treasury shares under this program 
we are uncertain as to the level of stock repurchases to be made in the future 
net cash provided by discontinued operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the amount includes one time cash receipts from advanced medical optics resulting from the sale of certain assets to advanced medical optics in connection with its formation and restructuring and a capital distribution received by us just prior to the spin off of advanced medical optics 
as of december   we had a committed domestic long term credit facility  a commercial paper program  a medium term note program  and an unused debt shelf registration statement that we expect to use for a new medium term note program 
the credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million through the commercial paper program also provides for up to million in borrowings 
however  we do not currently intend to have combined borrowings under our committed credit facility and our commercial paper program that would exceed million in the aggregate 
the current medium term note program allows us to issue up to an additional million in notes on a non revolving basis 
the shelf registration statement provides for up to million in additional debt securities 
borrowings under the credit facility and medium term note program are subject to certain financial and operating covenants that include  among other provisions  maintaining minimum debt to capitalization ratios and minimum consolidated net worth 
certain covenants also limit subsidiary debt and restrict dividend payments

as of december   the conversion criteria had not been met 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of the conversion features 
on december   we paid million to redeem a substantial portion of our zero coupon convertible subordinated notes due with an aggregate principal amount at maturity of million and a net book value at the time of redemption of million after adjusting for the unamortized discount 
we recorded a pre tax loss of million in connection with the early retirement that includes the million prepayment premium  the write off of million of deferred debt issue costs and other costs of million 
we currently intend to retire in november the remaining net book value of the zero coupon convertible subordinated notes not redeemed in see note to our consolidated financial statements 
a substantial portion of our existing cash and equivalents are held by non us subsidiaries 
we plan to use these funds in our operations outside the united states 
we have approximately million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes have not been provided 
tax costs could be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our working capital requirements  debt service and other cash needs over the next year 

table of contents capital expenditures expenditures for property  plant and equipment totaled million in  million in and million in expenditures in included initial construction costs for a new research and development facility  expansion of manufacturing facilities and a variety of other projects designed to improve productivity 
we expect to invest approximately million to million in additional construction costs for the new research and development facility  expansion of manufacturing capacity and laboratory facilities  and other property  plant and equipment in inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services used by us 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our revenues in were derived from operations outside the us  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was as follows a million decrease in  a million decrease in  and a million decrease in the sales decrease included decreases of million related to the brazilian real and million related to other latin american currencies  partially offset by an million increase related to the euro 
the sales decrease was due primarily to a weakening of european currencies  the brazilian real and the japanese yen 
the sales decrease related to a decline in the value of european currencies  the australian dollar and most latin american and asian currencies versus the us dollar

the option will only become exercisable by us on the earlier of one of the following events the following two events have occurred i the portfolio has resulted in at least three research successes  as that term is defined in the option agreement eg  an acceptance of an investigational new drug application  commencement of a phase clinical trial  or the granting of a new drug application and ii two years have passed since the effective date of the option agreement  or the amount of money provided by the investor and available for research and development by bardeen has either i fallen below an amount required to fund bardeen s anticipated research and development activities during the next day period or ii fallen below  a funding shortfall  or a change of law  regulation  or interpretive legal or accounting principles has occurred which could materially affect our relationship with bardeen 
the investor s obligations to continue to fund bardeen are affected by certain events  including our ability to adequately perform research and development services for bardeen  our ability to meet our obligations  and changes of control of our company 
in the event that the investor is relieved of its obligation to fund bardeen as a result of any of the foregoing  a funding shortfall could occur and the exercisability of the option could accelerate 
the option expires if not exercised by the earlier of five years from the date of the parties agreement or days after a funding shortfall 
the option price takes into account the amount of research and development funds expended at risk by bardeen on the portfolio and the time that has elapsed since the effective date of the parties option agreement 
although not currently exercisable  for illustrative purposes if we had been able to and did exercise the option as of december   the option price would have been approximately million 
if bardeen continues to fund research and development on the portfolio at the level currently anticipated  and we exercised the option at the end of april  the option price would be approximately million 
additionally  the option price would be greater in later years  as bardeen expended additional funds on research and development 
neither bardeen nor the investor has the ability to require us to exercise the option or to require us to provide any funding to bardeen  and we have not and do not intend to provide any funding to bardeen 
in the event we do not exercise the option or our product purchase right  bardeen has the ability to sell compounds or products to other third parties 
bardeen s current portfolio research and development activities take place under a research and development services agreement between us and bardeen pursuant to which all such activities are fully funded by bardeen and our services are performed on a cost plus basis 
because the financial risk associated with the research and development has been transferred to bardeen and repayment of the funds provided by bardeen depends solely on the results of the research and development having future economic benefit  we recognize revenues and related costs as services are performed under such agreement as required under sfas no 
 research and development arrangements 
these amounts are included in research service revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
for the year ended december   we recognized million and million in research revenues and research costs  respectively  under the research and development services agreement with bardeen 
for the year ended december   we recognized million and 
table of contents million in research revenues and research costs  respectively  under the research and development services agreement with bardeen 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for activities relating to foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 
we have recorded current changes in the fair value of open foreign currency option contracts as unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments  net  and we have recorded the gains and losses realized from settled option contracts in other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
we have recorded all unrealized and realized gains and losses from foreign currency forward contracts through other  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
was issued  as amended  and was effective for all periods of fiscal years beginning after june  january  for us 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for all derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of position and measure those instruments at fair value 
sfas no 
requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized in earnings unless specific hedging accounting criteria are met 
accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement  and requires that an entity must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of derivative instruments that receive hedge accounting 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we identified two types of derivative instruments at december   which were recorded as other current assets on our condensed consolidated balance sheet at january   the date of adoption of sfas no 
the derivative instruments are foreign currency option contracts and foreign currency forward contracts 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 our management decided not to designate the foreign currency option and foreign currency forward contracts as accounting hedges 
accordingly  we recorded a net of tax cumulative effect loss of million into earnings to adjust the foreign currency option and forward contracts to fair value at january  interest rate risk our interest income and expense is more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents  interest expense on our debt as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt 
if the interest rates on the variable rate debt were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense would increase or decrease by approximately million

foreign currency risk overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow management to focus its attention on our core business issues and challenges 
accordingly  we enter into contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed one year 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
the principal currencies subject to this process are the japanese yen  euro  british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
as all of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into to protect the value of foreign denominated intercompany receivables  the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are economically designed to offset the changes in the revaluation of the foreign denominated intercompany receivables 
as a result  we have recorded current changes in both the foreign currency forward contracts and revaluation of the foreign denominated intercompany receivables through other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
all of our outstanding foreign currency options are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily earnings denominated in the japanese yen  euro  
table of contents british pound  australian dollar  canadian dollar and the brazilian real 
as a result  we have recorded the changes in the fair value of open foreign currency option contracts during and through earnings as unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments  net while we have recorded any realized gains on settled contracts through earnings as other  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
the premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized to other  net over the life of the options

certain of our sales arrangements include undelivered elements that have historically been considered incidental and perfunctory

 consolidation of variable interest entities  fin which requires extensive disclosures including certain disclosures that are applicable to december  financial statements and will require companies to evaluate variable interest entities to determine whether to apply the consolidation provisions of fin to those entities 
companies must apply fin to entities with which they are involved if the entity s equity has specified characteristics 
if it is reasonably possible that a company will have a significant variable interest in a variable 
table of contents interest entity at the date fin s consolidation requirements become effective  the company must disclose the nature  purpose  size and activities of the variable interest entity and the consolidated enterprise s maximum exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with the variable interest entity in all financial statements issued after january  including december  financial statements regardless of when the variable interest entity was created 
we believe the consolidation provisions of fin  if applicable  would apply to variable interest entities created after january  immediately  and to variable interest entities created before february  in our interim period beginning after june  we are currently analyzing the impact of the adoption of fin on our consolidated financial statements
