working capital was million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
our working capital declined in from because a significant portion of our long term debt was current at december  during  we repaid million of bank debt and in we paid off another million 
at december   we had no bank debt outstanding 
we believe that funds generated from operations and funds available to us under our revolving credit facility agreement will be sufficient to finance our current operations and planned capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december   a decrease of million from million at december  this decrease is primarily due to payments on our bank debt and purchases of capital equipment 
these expenditures were partially offset by positive net cash flows provided by our operating activities 
cash generated from operating activities in totaled million due to net income of million and non cash charges of million primarily for deferred income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million also contributed to an increase in cash provided by operating activities 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is mainly due to the timing of purchases and increased revenue activity in the fourth quarter of these cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily related to the timing of sales

decreases in inventories of million and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million also contributed to an increase in cash provided by operating activities 
the decrease in inventories is primarily due to management initiatives in focused on inventory reduction and also due to increased product shipments 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities is mainly due to the timing of purchases and increased revenue activity relative to the fourth quarter of these cash flows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million primarily related to the timing of sales 
cash used by investing activities was  exclusively for the purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash used in financing activities was million primarily due to payments on our credit facility 
in december  the company further amended its credit facility  which under the terms of the amendment  was converted to a million revolving credit facility  of which there was no outstanding balance at december  the borrowings under the revolving credit facility are limited to eligible accounts receivable and inventories as defined by the agreement 
under the terms of the amended agreement  the company may borrow at the prime rate of interest or libor plus a margin of 
interest is payable within to days  as defined by the agreement 
the amended agreement terminates on december  the credit facility requires  among other things  the maintenance of specified financial ratios including fixed charge coverage and total debt to ebitda  as defined in the agreement  and restrictions on capital expenditures  payment of dividends and operating lease expenditures 
we buy a significant portion of our ribbons  an important component of our revenue  from one supplier 
in  we added a second ribbon supplier that provides similar ribbons on comparable terms 
we believe a change in suppliers would not adversely affect our operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based upon the information available to us  the results of which form a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition we recognize revenue when title passes  which generally is at the time of shipment 
we provide for estimated warranty costs and estimated returns in the period revenue is recognized 
certain of our customers have arrangements that include stock balancing and return provisions 
we provide an allowance for stock balancing based on estimated expected returns 
we record changes to our stock balancing estimates by adjusting sales with a corresponding adjustment to the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
sales to these customers collectively represented  and  respectively  of net sales for the years ended december   and under the terms of the stock balancing agreements  we estimate that the maximum amount of returns is approximately  at december   of which we have recorded an allowance of  for stock balancing estimated returns 
this reserve is included in our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns we determine the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns considering a number of factors  including historical experience  aging of the accounts receivable  analysis of stock balancing agreements and specific information obtained by us on the financial condition and the current creditworthiness of our customers 
if the financing conditions of our customers were to deteriorate and reduce the ability of our customers to make payments on their accounts  we may be required to increase our allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
likewise  should the financial condition of our customers improve and result in payments or settlements of previously reserved amounts  we may be required to record a reduction in bad debt expense to reverse the recorded allowance 
our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns was  at december  allowance for excess and obsolete inventories we value our inventories at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture  or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements for the subsequent twelve and twenty four months 
we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  however any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of inventories and reported operating results 
our allowance for excess and obsolete inventories at december   was  warranty accrual our products are covered by a standard one year warranty from the date of sale 
estimated warranty costs are accrued in the same period in which the related revenue is recognized  based on anticipated parts and labor costs  utilizing historical experience 
our warranty accrual at december   was  deferred tax asset the realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income which we believe is more likely than not 
we anticipate future taxable income sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
historically  we have generated operating income 
future taxable income is based on our forecasts of operating results  and there can be no assurance that such results will be achieved 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years  however  there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies for guarantees issued after january  that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
at december   we do not have any significant guarantees

in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation addresses the requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities in which they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of their variable economic interests 
the interpretation is intended to provide guidance in judging multiple economic interests in an entity and in determining the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation outlines disclosure requirements for variable interest entities in existence prior to january   and outlines consolidation requirements for variable interest entities created after january  we have reviewed our major commercial relationships and our overall economic interests with other companies consisting of related parties  contracted manufacturing vendors  and other suppliers to determine the extent of our variable economic interest in these parties 
the review has not resulted in a determination that we would be judged to be the primary economic beneficiary in any material relationships  or that any material entities would be judged to be variable interest entities of ours 
we feel we have appropriately reported the economic impact and our share of risks of our commercial relationships through our disclosure of purchase and other commitments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price of a financial instrument 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes 
market risk is attributed to all market sensitive financial instruments  including long term debt 
interest rate risk we are potentially exposed to market risk from interest rate changes in our credit agreement 
during  borrowings under the credit agreement bore interest at the prime rate of interest plus a margin of to or libor plus a margin of to 
for borrowings under the credit agreement  we typically lock into a fixed interest rate for periods between to days 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolver 
in addition  during  we repaid our term loan 
foreign currency risk we denominate all foreign sales in us dollars and do not hedge against currency fluctuations 
we purchase components and supplies from several japanese suppliers 
the strengthening of the yen versus the us dollar in caused the cost of these supplies to increase 
to date  currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition  but could in the future by causing our products to become less affordable or less price competitive than those of foreign manufacturers or by causing the costs of our material supplies to increase 
with the implementation of the agreement we made in february with our supplier to purchase dye sublimation ribbons in dollars rather than in yen  we believe that we have reduced the risks of increased purchasing costs that would otherwise occur if the dollar weakens relative to the yen 
we have foregone the opportunity  however  to benefit from the full potential cost savings if the dollar strengthens relative to the yen 
equity price risk we do not generally invest in marketable equity securities 
at december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  comprising approximately of our total assets 
accordingly  a sustained decrease in the rate of interest earned would not have a material adverse effect on our business
