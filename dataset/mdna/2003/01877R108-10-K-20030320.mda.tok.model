item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations and our predecessor should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for more detailed information regarding the basis of presentation for the following financial information  see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note organization and presentation and note summary of significant accounting policies 
critical accounting policies from our summary of significant accounting policies  we have identified the following accounting policies that require the exercise of our most difficult  complex and subjective levels of judgment 
our judgments in the following areas are principally based on estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
actual results that are influenced by future events could materially differ from the current estimates 
long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
the amount of an impairment is measured by the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset  which is based on cash flows from that asset  discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
events or changes in circumstance that could cause the partnership to perform such a review include  but are not limited to  the loss of a major coal supply agreement  a significant decline in demand for the partnership s coal and an adverse change in geologic conditions 
reclamation and mine closing costs the federal smcra and similar state statutes require that mine property be restored in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan 
we record the liability for the estimated cost of future mine reclamation and closing procedures on a present value basis when incurred  and the associated cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
those costs relate to sealing portals at underground mines and to reclaiming the final pit and support acreage at surface mines 
other costs common to both types of mining are related to removing or covering refuse piles and settling ponds  and dismantling preparation plants  other facilities and roadway infrastructure 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these costs at december  and  respectively 
workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits we provide income replacement and medical treatment for work related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws 
we provide for these claims through self insurance programs 
the liability for traumatic injury claims is the estimated present value of current workers compensation benefits  based on an annual actuarial study performed by an independent actuary 
the actuarial calculations are based on a blend of actuarial projection methods and numerous assumptions including development patterns  mortality  medical costs and interest rates 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these costs at december  and  respectively 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the liability at december  approximately million  which would have a corresponding increase in operating expenses 
coal mining companies are subject to the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various state statues for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker s pneumoconiosis black lung 
we provide for these claims through self insurance programs 
our estimated black lung liability is based on an annual actuarial study performed by an independent actuary 
the actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
we had accrued liabilities of million and million for these benefits at december  and  respectively 
a one percentage point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the expense recognized for the year ended december  by approximately million 
under the service cost method used to estimate our black lung benefits liability  actuarial gains or losses attributable to changes in actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate are amortized over the remaining service period of active miners 
effective january   we changed our method of estimating black lung benefits to the service cost method described in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which method is permitted under sfas no 
employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
in january  governmental regulations regarding the federal black lung benefits claims approval process became effective 
these new regulations specifically define the black lung disability as progressive and also expand the definition of pneumoconiosis to mandate consideration of diseases that are caused by factors other than exposure to coal dust 
we believe the change to the sfas no 
measurement methodology better matches black lung costs over the service lives of the miners who ultimately receive the black lung benefits and is more reflective of the recently enacted regulations  which place significant emphasis on coal miners future years of employment in the coal industry 
we previously accrued the black lung benefits liability at the present value of the actuarially determined current and future estimated black lung benefit payments utilizing the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which was also permitted by sfas no 
business we are a diversified producer and marketer of coal to major us utilities and industrial users 
in  our total production was million tons and our total sales were million tons 
the coal we produced in was approximately low sulfur coal  medium sulfur coal and high sulfur coal 
at december   we had approximately million tons of proven and probable coal reserves in illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland and west virginia 
we believe we control adequate reserves to implement our currently contemplated mining plans 
in addition  there are substantial unleased reserves on adjacent properties that we currently intend to acquire or lease as our mining operations approach these areas 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage was consumed by electric utilities with the balance consumed by cogeneration plants and industrial users 
our largest customers in were seminole  sso  and vepco 
in  approximately of our sales tonnage  including approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal sales tonnage  was sold under long term contracts 
the balance of our sales were made in the spot market 
our long term contracts contribute to our stability and profitability by providing greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices 
in  approximately of our medium and high sulfur coal was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices  also known as scrubbers  to remove sulfur dioxide 
we have entered into long term agreements with sso to host and operate its coal synfuel production facility currently located at hopkins  supply the facility with coal feedstock  assist sso with the marketing of coal synfuel and provide it with other services 
these agreements expire on december  and provide us with coal sales  and rental and service fees from sso based on the synfuel facility throughput tonnages 
these amounts are dependent on the ability of sso s members to use certain qualifying tax credits applicable to the facility 
the term of each of these agreements is subject to early cancellation provisions customary for transactions of these types  including the unavailability of coal synfuel tax credits  the termination of associated coal synfuel sales contracts  and the occurrence of certain force majeure events 
therefore  the continuation of the operating revenues associated with the coal synfuel production facility cannot be assured 
however  we have maintained back up coal supply agreements with each coal synfuel customer that automatically provide for sale of our coal to these customers in the event they do not purchase coal synfuel from sso 
in conjunction with a decision to relocate the coal synfuel production facility to warrior  agreements for providing certain of these services were assigned to alliance service  a wholly owned subsidiary of alliance coal  in december alliance service is subject to federal and state income taxes 
one of our business strategies is to continue to make productivity improvements to remain a low cost producer in each region in which we operate 
our principal expenses related to the production of coal are labor and benefits  equipment  materials and supplies  maintenance  royalties and excise taxes 
unlike most of our competitors in the eastern us  we employ a totally union free workforce 
many of the benefits of the union free workforce are not necessarily reflected in direct costs  but we believe are related to higher productivity 
in addition  while we do not pay our customers transportation costs  they may be substantial and often the determining factor in a coal consumer s contracting decision 
our mining operations are located near many of the major eastern utility generating plants and on major coal hauling railroads in the eastern us we believe this gives us a transportation cost advantage compared to many of our competitors 
results of operations compared with coal sales 
coal sales for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher price sales contracts secured during the second half of last year  increased tons associated with coal feedstock for coal synfuel production  and higher productivity and sales from gibson 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in the domestic coal brokerage market 
tons sold increased to million for from million in tons produced increased to million for from million for transportation revenues 
transportation revenues for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to the increase in tons sold 
we reflect reimbursement of the cost of transporting coal to customers through third party carriers as transportation revenues and the corresponding expense as transportation expense in the consolidated statements of income 
no margin is realized on transportation revenues 
other sales and operating revenues 
other sales and operating revenues increased to million for from million for the increase of million is attributable to additional rental and service fees associated with increased volumes at a third party coal synfuel production facility at hopkins 
see the discussion above under business 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million is primarily the result of increased operating costs associated with increased sales volumes and coal synfuel production 
transportation expenses 
see transportation revenues above concerning the increase in transportation expenses 
outside purchases 
outside purchases increased to million for from million for the increase of million is primarily the result of outside purchases necessary to fulfill feedstock contract commitments at hopkins  offset by a decrease in the activity in the domestic coal brokerage market 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher accruals related to the short term incentive plan  combined with additional restricted units granted under the long term incentive plan 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million primarily resulted from additional depreciation expense associated with the new gibson complex 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million for from million for the decrease of million primarily reflects debt reduction due to scheduled debt payments 
income taxes 
although we are not a taxable entity for federal or state income tax purposes  our subsidiary  alliance service is subject to federal and state income taxes 
in conjunction with a decision to relocate the coal synfuel facility  agreements for a portion of the services provided to the coal synfuel producer were assigned to alliance service in december income taxes were not incurred in in  income taxes are estimated to be between million and million 
ebitda income before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million for compared with million for the results include the benefit of a cumulative effect of accounting change totaling million related to a change in the method of estimating the black lung benefits liability 
excluding the benefit of the accounting change during  ebitda for increased million or 
the million increase in ebitda  after excluding the effect of the accounting change  is primarily attributable to higher price sales contracts  increased volumes associated with coal synfuel related agreements  and higher sales volume at gibson 
for an explanation of ebitda and a reconciliation of ebitda to net income  please read footnotes and to item selected financial data 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  income before income taxes  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda has not been adjusted for unusual items or the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow and does not represent the measure of cash available for distribution 
our method of computing ebitda also may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies  or ebitda may be computed differently by us in different contexts ie  public reporting versus computation under financing agreements 
compared with coal sales 
coal sales for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher price sales contracts and volumes reflecting increased utility demand  increased activity in the domestic coal brokerage market due to favorable spot price levels and additional revenues from the new gibson complex  which opened in late tons sold increased to million for from million in tons produced increased to million for from million for transportation revenues 
transportation revenues for increased to million from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to the increase in tons sold 
we reflect reimbursement of the cost of transporting coal to customers through third party carriers as transportation revenues and the corresponding expense as transportation expense in the consolidated statements of income 
no margin is realized on transportation revenues 
other sales and operating revenues 
other sales and operating revenues increased to million for from million for the increase of million is attributable to additional service fees associated with increased volumes at a third party coal synfuel production facility at hopkins 
see the discussion immediately above under business 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million resulted from increased sales volumes as well as additional operating expenses associated with a full year of operation at gibson  which opened in late  and difficult mining conditions encountered at several operations 
those difficult mining conditions placed an undue burden on equipment scheduled for replacement  resulting in unanticipated equipment failures and higher maintenance costs 
transportation expenses 
see transportation revenues above concerning the increase in transportation expenses 
outside purchases 
outside purchases increased to million for from million for the increase of million resulted from increased activity in the domestic coal brokerage market due to improved profit margins on spot coal sales  which resulted in increased volumes at higher purchase prices 
the higher brokerage volumes are largely attributable to short term opportunities in the domestic coal brokerage markets  which are not expected to be material in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million was primarily attributable to higher accruals related to the short term incentive plan  combined with additional restricted units granted under the long term incentive plan 
the long term incentive plan accrual is impacted by the increased market value of our common units 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses increased to million for from million for the increase of million primarily resulted from additional depreciation expense associated with a full year of operation at gibson  which opened in late interest expense 
interest expense was comparable for and at million and million  respectively 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
effective january   we changed our method of estimating our black lung benefits liability 
see the discussion above under workers compensation and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
ebitda income before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million for compared with million for excluding the net benefits of the change in accounting method in and the unusual items in  ebitda for was million  compared to million for the million increase was primarily attributable to higher price sales contracts and volumes reflecting increased utility demand during and a full year of operations at gibson  which opened in late  and the increased revenue from the third party coal synfuel facility at hopkins 
for an explanation of ebitda and a reconciliation of ebitda to net income  please read footnotes and to item selected financial data 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  income before income taxes  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda has not been adjusted for unusual items or the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
ebitda is not intended to represent cash flow and does not represent the measure of cash available for distribution 
our method of computing ebitda also may not be the same method used to compute similar measures reported by other companies  or ebitda may be computed differently by us in different contexts ie  public reporting versus computation under financing agreements 
outlook ongoing acquisition activities consistent with our business strategy  from time to time we engage in discussions with potential sellers regarding the possible purchase by us of coal production and marketing assets 
sarbanes oxley act and new sec rules several regulatory and legislative initiatives were introduced in in response to developments during and regarding accounting issues at large public companies  resulting in disruptions in the capital markets and ensuing calls for action to prevent repetition of those events 
we support the actions called for under these initiatives and believe these steps will ultimately be successful in accomplishing the stated objectives 
however  implementation of reforms in connection with these initiatives will add to the costs of doing business for all publicly traded entities  including us 
these costs will have an adverse impact on future income and cash flow  especially in the near term as legal  financial and consultant costs are incurred to analyze the new requirements  formalize current practices and implement required changes to ensure that we maintain compliance with these new rules 
we are not able to estimate the magnitude of increase in our costs that will result from such reforms 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity we generally satisfy our working capital requirements and fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations from cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major capital improvements or acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and mqd payments 
to further develop available financing alternatives  in october  we entered into a master lease agreement 
under the master lease agreement  lease terms and rental payments are negotiated individually when specific pieces of equipment are leased 
we had no equipment leased under the master equipment lease at december  selected pieces of equipment will be leased in when the lease terms are considered favorable 
our credit facilities limit the amount of total operating lease obligations to million payable in any period of consecutive months 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and planned expenditures will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry  some of which are beyond our control 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was principally attributable to operating income and working capital changes during compared to net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million in the increased use of cash is principally attributable to reduced liquidation of marketable securities  net of purchases  during compared to net cash used in financing activities was million for  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for cash used in financing activities during and was a direct result of eight quarterly distributions of per unit on common and subordinated units outstanding 
the quarterly cash distribution was increased to per unit with respect to the fourth quarter of  which was paid in february we expect to maintain this level of quarterly cash distribution during additionally  during and  we made scheduled debt payments of million and million  respectively 
we have various commitments primarily related to long term debt  operating lease commitments related to buildings and equipment  obligations for estimated reclamation and mining closing costs  capital project commitments  and pension funding 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash generated from operations  proceeds from marketable securities  and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the following table provides details regarding our contractual cash obligations as of december  less contractual than after obligations total year years years years long term debt      operating leases      other long term obligations excluding discount effect of million for reclamation liability      capital projects   pension liability   capital expenditures capital expenditures decreased to million in  compared to million in the decrease is principally attributable to capital expenditures related to capital for a new service shaft at dotiki and extension into the pattiki ii coal reserve  offset by the completion of gibson during in february  we acquired warrior from an affiliate  arh warrior holdings  pursuant to the terms of a previously existing agreement 
warrior owns an underground mining complex located between and adjacent to our other western kentucky operations near madisonville  kentucky 
the operation utilizes continuous mining units employing room and pillar mining techniques producing high sulfur coal 
since january  substantially all of the coal produced by warrior has been sold to hopkins for subsequent resale to sso for use as feedstock in the production of coal synfuel 
since  warrior invested in new infrastructure capital projects that are expected to improve warrior s productivity and significantly increase warrior s annual production capacity 
we plan to transfer an additional continuous mining unit to warrior in the second quarter of  to supplant other operations of the partnership that will be depleting 
we paid million to arh warrior holdings in accordance with the terms of an amended and restated put and call option agreement 
in addition  we repaid warrior s borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement between an affiliate of arh warrior holdings and warrior 
we funded the warrior acquisition through a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of  common units in february as a result of the warrior acquisition  we currently project that our average annual maintenance capital expenditures will increase to million  which figure includes capital equipment that may be leased under the master equipment lease discussed above 
we also currently expect to fund our anticipated capital expenditures  with the exception of the warrior acquisition described above  with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility described below 
universal shelf in april  we filed with the securities and exchange commission a universal shelf registration statement allowing us to issue from time to time up to an aggregate of million of debt or equity securities 
at march   we had approximately million available under this registration statement 
notes offering and credit facility concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering  the special general partner issued and the intermediate partnership assumed the obligations with respect to million principal amount of senior notes due august  senior notes 
the special general partner also entered into  and the intermediate partnership assumed the obligations under  a million credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility consists of three tranches  including a million term loan facility  a million working capital facility  and a million revolving credit facility 
we had borrowings outstanding of million and million under the term loan facility and no borrowings outstanding under either the working capital facility or the revolving credit facility at december   and  respectively 
the interest rates on the term loan facility at december   and  were and  respectively 
the credit facility expires august the senior notes and credit facility are guaranteed by all of the subsidiaries of the intermediate partnership 
the senior notes and credit facility contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants  including the amount of distributions by the intermediate partnership and the incurrence of other debt 
we were in compliance with the covenants of both the credit facility and senior notes at december  and we have entered into agreements with three banks to provide letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million to maintain surety bonds to secure its obligations for reclamation liabilities and workers compensation benefits 
at december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding 
the special general partner guarantees the letters of credit 
related party transactions administrative services our partnership agreement provides that our managing general partner and its affiliates be reimbursed for all direct and indirect expenses it incurs or payments it makes on our behalf  including  but not limited to  management s salaries and related benefits  and accounting  budget  planning  treasury  public relations  land administration  environmental  permitting  payroll  benefits  disability  workers compensation management  legal and information technology services 
our managing general partner may determine in its sole discretion the expenses that are allocable to us 
total costs billed by our managing general partner and its affiliates to us were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
warrior coal acquisition on february   we acquired warrior from an affiliate  arh warrior holdings a subsidiary of alliance resource holdings  pursuant to an amended and restated put and call option agreement put call agreement 
warrior purchased the capital stock of roberts bros 
coal co  inc  warrior coal mining company  warrior coal corporation and certain assets of christian coal corp 
and richland mining co  inc in january our managing general partner had previously declined the opportunity to purchase these assets as we had previously committed to major capital expenditures at two existing operations 
as a condition to not exercising its right of first refusal  we requested that arh warrior holdings enter into a put and call arrangement for warrior 
we and arh warrior holdings  with the approval of the conflicts committee of our managing general partner  entered into the put call agreement in january concurrently  arh warrior holdings acquired warrior in january for million 
the put call agreement preserved the opportunity for us to acquire warrior during a specified time period at a price significantly greater than the price paid by arh warrior holdings 
under the terms of the put call agreement  arh warrior holdings exercised its put option requiring us to purchase warrior at a put option price of approximately million 
the option provisions of the put call agreement were subject to certain conditions unless otherwise waived  including  among others  a the non occurrence of a material adverse change in the business and financial condition of warrior  b the prohibition of any dividends or other distributions to warrior s shareholders  c the maintenance of warrior s assets in good working condition  d the prohibition on the sale of any equity interest in warrior except for the options contained in the put call agreement  and e the prohibition on the sale or transfer of warrior s assets except those made in the ordinary course of its business 
the put call agreement option prices reflected negotiated sale and purchase amounts that both parties determined would allow each party to satisfy acceptable minimum investment returns in the event either the put or call options were exercised 
in january and in december  we developed financial projections for warrior based on due diligence procedures we customarily perform when considering the acquisition of a coal mine 
the assumptions underlying the financial projections made by us for warrior included  among others  a annual production levels ranging from million to million tons  b coal prices at or below the then current coal prices and c a discount rate of percent 
based on these financial projections  as of december  and  we believe that the fair value of warrior was equal to or greater than the put option exercise price 
the put option price of million was paid to arh warrior holdings in accordance with the terms of the put call agreement  under which the put option period was extended through february  in addition  we repaid warrior s borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement between the special general partner and warrior 
the primary borrowings under the revolving credit agreement financed new infrastructure capital projects at warrior that are expected to improve productivity and significantly increase capacity 
we funded the warrior acquisition through a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of  common units 
based upon our current financial projections  we continue to believe that the fair value of warrior is equal to or greater than the put option exercise price 
because the warrior acquisition was between entities under common control  it will be accounted for at historical cost in a manner similar to that used in a pooling of interests 
under the terms of the put call agreement  we assumed certain other obligations  including a mineral lease and sublease with sgp land  llc sgp land  a subsidiary of our special general partner  covering coal reserves that have been and will continue to be mined by warrior 
the terms and conditions of the mineral lease and sub lease remain unchanged 
during and  we provided management and administrative services to warrior under an administrative service agreement 
under this agreement  we recognized approximately  and  as a reduction of general and administrative expenses during the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we entered into an agreement with warrior to perform certain reclamation procedures for us 
the total estimated cost of the reclamation procedures covered by this agreement is  of which approximately  and  was paid to warrior for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  we made coal purchases of approximately  and  respectively  from warrior 
accounts payable to warrior of  and  is included in the amount due to affiliates at december  and  respectively 
during  we made coal sales of approximately million to warrior 
accounts receivable from warrior of million offsets a portion of the amount due to affiliates at december  sgp land we have a mineral lease and sublease with sgp land requiring annual minimum royalty payments of million  payable in advance through or until million of cumulative annual minimum and or earned royalty payments have been paid 
we paid annual minimum royalties of million during each of the three years in the period ended december  we also have an option to lease and or sublease certain reserves from sgp land  which reserves are contiguous to hopkins 
under the terms of the option to lease and sublease  we paid option fees of  during the years ended december  and the anticipated annual minimum royalty obligation is  payable in advance  from through in  sgp land  as successor in interest to an unaffiliated third party  entered into an amended mineral lease with mc mining 
under the terms of the lease  mc mining has paid and will continue to pay an annual minimum royalty obligation of  until million of cumulative annual minimum and or earned royalty payments have been paid 
mc mining paid royalties of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
special general partner effective january  gibson entered into a noncancelable operating lease arrangement with the special gp for its coal preparation plant and ancillary facilities 
based on the terms of the lease  gibson has paid and will continue to make monthly payments of approximately  through january lease expense incurred for the three years in the period ended december  was we have entered into agreements with three banks to provide letters of credit in an aggregate amount of million to maintain surety bonds to secure our obligations for reclamation liabilities and workers compensation benefits 
at december   we had million in outstanding letters of credit 
our special general partner guarantees these letters of credit  and as a result we have agreed to compensate our special general partner a guarantee fee equal to per annum of the face amount of the letters of credit outstanding 
we paid approximately  and  in guarantee fees to our special general partner for the years ended december  and  respectively 
accruals of other liabilities we had accruals for other liabilities  including current obligations  totaling million and million at december  and these accruals were chiefly comprised of workers compensation benefits  black lung benefits  and costs associated with reclamation and mine closings 
these obligations are self insured 
the accruals of these items were based on estimates of future expenditures based on current legislation  related regulations and other developments 
thus  from time to time  our results of operations may be significantly affected by changes to these liabilities 
see item financial statements and supplementary data 
note reclamation and mine closing costs and note pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
pension plan we maintain a defined benefit pension plan pension plan  which covers certain employees at the mining operations 
our pension expense was approximately  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the pension expense is based upon a number of actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets of and a discount rate of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additionally  we base our determination of pension expense on an unsmoothed market related valuation of assets equal to the fair value of assets  which immediately recognizes all investment gains or losses 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our investment manager  including their review of asset class return expectations by economists  and our actuary 
historically  we have assumed that our investment managers will generate long term returns of at least 
effective january   we adjusted our assumption of long term return to at least 
our advisors base the projected returns on broad equity and bond indices 
our expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return of  and with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the discount rate that we utilize for determining our future pension obligation is based on a review of currently available high quality fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
we have historically used the average monthly yield for december of an aa rated utility bond index as the primary benchmark for establishing the discount rate 
the duration of the bonds that comprise this index is comparable to the duration of the benefit obligation in the pension plan 
the discount rate determined on this basis decreased from at december  to at december  we estimate that our pension plan expense and cash contributions will be approximately  and  respectively in future actual pension expense and contributions will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employees participating in the pension plan 
lowering the expected long term rate of return assumption by from to at december  would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately  lowering the discount rate assumption by from to at december  would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately  inflation inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the three years in the period ended december  recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets 
this standard discontinues the practice of amortizing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  a cost is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value for each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to settle the liability  the obligation for its recorded amount is paid or a gain or loss upon settlement is incurred 
since we historically adhered to accounting principles similar to sfas no 
in accounting for reclamation and mine closing costs  we do not believe that adoption of sfas no 
 effective january   will have a material impact on our financial statements 
effective january   the partnership adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard had no material effect on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we do not believe this interpretation will have a material effect on our financial statements upon adoption 
risk factors if any of the following risks were actually to occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and the trading price of our common units could decline 
risks inherent in our business a substantial or extended decline in coal prices could negatively impact our results of operations 
several of our customers have had their credit rating down graded  and one customer recently filed for bankruptcy 
while we have not received notice of  and otherwise are not aware of  the intent of any of these customers to default on their contractual obligations to us  the lowered credit ratings and the bankruptcy filing of these customers indicate that this is a possibility 
several coal companies that compete with us have recently filed for bankruptcy protection 
if they emerge from bankruptcy with their debt burden reduced or eliminated  those companies may possess a significant competitive advantage over us 
a material portion of our net income and cash flow is dependent on the continued ability by us or others to realize benefits from state and federal tax credits 
if the benefit to us from any of these tax credits is materially reduced  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and might impair our ability to pay the distributions on our units 
competition within the coal industry may adversely affect our ability to sell coal  and excess production capacity in the industry could put downward pressure on coal prices 
most newly constructed power plants may be fueled by natural gas 
any change in consumption patterns by utilities away from the use of coal could affect our ability to sell the coal we produce 
from time to time conditions in the coal industry may make it more difficult for us to extend existing or enter into new long term contracts 
this could affect the stability and profitability of our operations 
some of our long term contracts contain provisions allowing for the renegotiation of prices and  in some instances  the termination of the contract or the suspension of purchases by customers 
some of our long term contracts require us to supply all of our customers coal needs 
if these customers coal requirements decline  our revenues under these contracts will also drop 
a substantial portion of our coal has a high sulfur content 
this coal may become more difficult to sell because the clean air act may impact the ability of electric utilities to burn high sulfur coal through the regulation of emissions 
we depend on a few customers for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of one or more significant customers could impact our ability to sell the coal we produce 
litigation relating to disputes with our customers may result in substantial costs  liabilities and loss of revenues 
the term of each of the agreements associated with the coal synfuel facility at hopkins is subject to early cancellation provisions customary for transactions of these types  including the unavailability of synfuel tax credits  the termination of associated coal synfuel sales contracts  and the occurrence of certain force majeure events 
therefore  the continuation of the operating revenues associated with the coal synfuel production facility cannot be assured 
any loss of the benefit from state tax credits may affect adversely our ability to pay distributions 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks that are beyond our control and these risks may not be fully covered under our insurance policies 
although none of our employees are members of unions  our work force may not remain union free in the future 
any significant increase in transportation costs or disruption of the transportation of our coal may impair our ability to sell coal 
we may not be able to grow successfully through future acquisitions  and we may not be able to effectively integrate the various businesses or properties we do acquire 
our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to replace our coal reserves 
the estimates of our reserves may prove inaccurate  and unitholders should not place undue reliance on these estimates 
cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance 
in addition  our managing general partner s discretion in establishing reserves may negatively impact a unitholder s receipt of cash distributions 
our indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow additional funds  make distributions to unitholders or capitalize on business opportunities 
risks inherent in an investment in the partnership under our management s buy out agreement with the beacon group  under some circumstances the beacon group may assume control of the business and affairs of our general partner 
the president and chief executive officer of our managing general partner effectively controls us through his ownership of a majority of the equity interests in our managing general partner and an affiliate 
unitholders have limited voting rights and do not control our managing general partner 
we may issue additional common units without the approval of common unitholders  which would dilute existing unitholders interests 
the issuance of additional common units  including upon conversion of subordinated units  will increase the risk that we will be unable to pay the full minimum quarterly distribution on all common units 
cost reimbursements to our general partners may be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution 
our managing general partner has a limited call right that may require unitholders to sell their common units at an undesirable time or price 
unitholders may not have limited liability under some circumstances 
our general partners and their affiliates  which are controlled by our management  may in some instances engage in activities that compete directly with us 
regulatory risks a recent federal district court decision  currently on appeal  extends prohibitions previously applicable only to surface mines to underground mines  which could limit our ability to conduct underground mining operations 
federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations related to a the statutory requirement that we return mined property to its approximate original condition and b workers compensation 
due to problems in the surety industry  like other mine operators we may have difficulty maintaining our surety bonds for mine reclamation as well as workers compensation and black lung benefits 
at december   we had million of surety bonds in place 
our failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material adverse effect on us 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations on health  safety  environmental and numerous other matters 
these regulations increase our costs of doing business  or discourage customers from buying our coal 
we have black lung benefits and workers compensation obligations that could increase if new legislation is enacted 
the clean air act affects our customers and could significantly influence their purchasing decisions 
new regulations under the clean air act could also reduce demand for our coal 
the passage of state and federal legislation responsive to concerns over emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide could result in a reduced use of coal by electric power generators 
any such reduction in use could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we are subject to the clean water act which imposes limitations  and monitoring and reporting obligations  on our discharge of pollutants into water 
those limitations and obligations may become more stringent and result in restricted operations and increased costs 
we are subject to the safe drinking water act  which imposes various requirements on us 
we are subject to reclamation  mine closure and real property restoration regulatory obligations and must accrue for the estimated cost of complying with these regulations 
we could incur significant costs under federal and state superfund and waste management statutes 
tax risks to common unitholders our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to entity level taxation by states 
if the irs treats us as a corporation or we become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  it would substantially reduce distributions to our unitholders and our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
we have not requested an irs ruling with respect to our tax treatment 
you may be required to pay taxes on income from us even if you receive no cash distributions 
tax gain or loss on disposition of common units could be different than expected 
common unitholders  other than individuals who are us residents  may experience adverse tax consequences from owning common units 
we have registered with the irs as a tax shelter 
this may increase the risk of an irs audit of us or a common unitholder 
we treat a purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of common units 
common unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes as a result of an investment in common units 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have significant long term coal supply agreements 
virtually all of the long term coal supply agreements are subject to price adjustment provisions  which permit an increase or decrease periodically in the contract price to principally reflect changes in specified price indices or items such as taxes  royalties or actual production costs 
for additional discussion of coal supply agreements  see item business 
coal marketing and sales and item financial statements and supplementary data 
note concentration of credit risk and major customers 
almost all of our predecessor s transactions were  and all of our transactions are  denominated in us dollars  and as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
we do not engage in any interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or commodity price hedging transactions 
the intermediate partnership assumed obligations under the credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility are at variable rates and  as a result  we have interest rate exposure 
the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement 
the fair values of long term debt are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses  based upon our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of december   and the carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments are as follows in thousands fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate       weighted average interest rate term loan floating rate     weighted average interest rate fair value expected maturity dates december  as of december  thereafter total senior notes fixed rate      weighted average interest rate term loan floating rate      weighted average interest rate
