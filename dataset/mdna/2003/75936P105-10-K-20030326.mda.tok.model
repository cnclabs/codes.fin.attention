in january the nhdes indicated concerns about surface water contamination  volatile organic chemical voc migration off of the property and air quality  and mandated further testing 
further test results and a scope of work plan for the required tests were submitted to the nhdes in february in june  the nhdes renewed the groundwater monitoring permit with certain stipulations and again expressed concerns related to indoor air quality  contaminant migration offsite and surface water contamination 
it mandated further testing and the submission of a scope of work plan related thereto by august  the company complied with the nhdes request and received approval in october to commence the additional testing which included testing on an adjacent property for voc migration and air quality testing

terrorism insurance in november  congress passed the terrorism risk insurance act of  which was enacted to help companies obtain terrorism insurance at reasonable rates 
as a result  the company s primary and excess liability carriers have made such insurance available from november  until the current underlying policies expire at june  the company was previously covered under its all risk property insurance policies for acts of terrorism on its consolidated real estate assets through june  terrorism coverage was available to the wellsford whitehall portfolio at december  the company and wellsford whitehall expect that similar coverage will be available in connection with an all risk policy and will need to make an assessment of the cost benefit of obtaining terrorism insurance in the future 
the underwriting procedures utilized by the company and second holding evaluate the impact of the lack of an appropriate amount of terrorism insurance  or inability to obtain terrorism insurance by property owners on single assets or small collateral pools for its debt investments 
inflation declining prices substantially all of wellsford capital s and wellsford whitehall s leases with their tenants provide for separate escalations of real estate taxes and operating expenses over a base amount 
in addition  many of the office leases provide for fixed base rent increases or indexed escalations based on the cpi or other measures 
the company believes that inflationary increases in expenses will generally be offset by the expense reimbursements and contractual rent increases described above 
a substantial majority of the leases at the company s multifamily properties are for a term of one year or less which may enable the company to seek increased rents upon renewal or re letting of apartment units during an inflationary period 
such short term leases generally minimize the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
conversely  in a period of declining economics  short term leases pose an increasing risk to the company of reduced rental revenue and decreased cash flow from lower rents in conjunction with concessions to new and renewal tenants 
this is currently being experienced by the company s palomino park operating properties 
assets in the wellsford whitehall portfolio are currently subject to similar risks regarding declining economics which may result in reduced rental revenue and decreased cash flow from lower rents and greater concessions to new and renewal tenants 
trends the markets in which the company owns and operates its assets or has investments in entities which own and operate assets are subjected to general and local economic business conditions 
based upon the current economic environment  these conditions may negatively impact the occupancy levels  rents and the amount of concessions at properties in the wellsford development and wellsford capital sbus or negatively impact property sales in the wellsford capital sbu and the sale of residential units at silver mesa in the wellsford development sbu 
wellsford whitehall would be similarly impacted by such conditions 
rising insurance premium costs or availability of certain insurance coverages may negatively impact the operating results and cash flows of the company s assets and sbus 
energy costs may continue to increase as a result of the threat of war  also negatively impacting operating results and cash flows 
the availability and cost of other natural resources  such as the lack of water supply caused by severe drought conditions in the denver market  could negatively impact operating results and cash flows as well
