item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this report 
network services we offer multinational enterprises global communications solutions delivered on our seamless  high performance network 
our clients use these services to manage information  including the secure delivery of mission critical enterprise applications that require predictable performance to users distributed worldwide 
for example  manufacturing enterprises use our services to integrate production and inventory schedules  technology enterprises use our services to transmit design files and financial institutions use our services to connect their trading desks 
typically  clients employ these services to transmit information that is critical to their daily operations 
within network services  we offer intranet  multimedia  internet and wireless remote access services 
intranet services 
infonet was the first company to offer application defined worldwide frame relay services in more than countries with customized performance levels 
through our frame relay service  we enable our clients to assign class of service levels to frame relay traffic for each application 
our ip vpn secure service supports ip vpns to provide functionality similar to the public internet but with the performance characteristics of the world network 
ip vpn secure is a leading edge service using mpls and offering classes of service for data  video and voice transmissions 
we offer our customers three levels of ip vpn secure services to meet specific application performance characteristics in addition to voice and video classes of service 
we back this capability with strong service level agreements 
we were among the first providers to offer an intranet ip vpn service and have over a decade of experience in provisioning services using the world leading internet protocol 
we believe that our ip vpn secure services are also well designed for corporations seeking to establish extranets or engage in e commerce 
our global asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  services address the increasing demand for high speed integrated voice  video and data services  and for bandwidth intensive applications  such as video conferencing 
using atm  we can prioritize traffic using class of service technology and transmit voice  data and video with guaranteed quality of service at speeds up to mbps 
these characteristics make atm an excellent choice for broadband communications 
by using atm to integrate data  video and voice services  we believe that our clients realize the highest performance from their applications and achieve significant cost savings 
multimedia services 
for many global enterprises  critical business support functions such as telephony  faxing and video conferencing can be costly and inefficient 
we believe that our multimedia solutions address the unique needs for global voice and video communications and provide a range of more cost effective  managed services for the multinational client 
our voice and video services provide integration of multiple voice  video  fax and data networks onto the world network to deliver a global enterprise solution 
these services are available both as standalone solutions and as converged solutions that accelerate the transition from traditional switched voice and video services to packet based services 
because voice and video can be integrated with any of infonet s class of service intranet services  clients have significant flexibility to design a service solution that is customized to meet their needs 
in addition  we offer our clients a customized dial plan capability and bill them with a single global invoice that includes location and call details 
internet services 
our ip vpn internet services enable clients to utilize infonet as their global internet service provider  or isp  with consolidated support and billing across multiple countries to access the internet or build an ip vpn over the public internet 
this capability is a distinct benefit for clients that would otherwise use multiple isps in different countries 
clients can connect to our internet backbone from more than countries using access services that include managed  dedicated and dial up internet access 
we also offer advanced encryption and authentication services through agreements with cisco systems and verisign  respectively 
our ip vpn internet service is often used to complement our private ip network service  ip vpn secure  in locations that cannot justify the cost or do not require the higher performance and associated costs involved with private ip networking 
wireless remote access services 
over the past ten years  we have evolved our remote access  or dialxpress  services to anticipate and satisfy our clients need for user mobility the ability to access corporate information and applications wherever an end user is working 
to that end  we offer our clients a variety of remote access services on a wireline and wireless basis 
our remote access services provide our clients employees  who are traveling or who are located remotely  with access to the same network applications that are available at their primary office 
using our services  applications such as enterprise resource planning  file sharing  internet access and e mail are accessible with higher levels of security and performance than would normally be provided if these applications were accessed via the public internet 
we contract with some of the industry s leading suppliers of enhanced security products to offer our clients security products that provide greater security than traditional password systems 
as a result  our remote access service provides connectivity for virtual offices almost anywhere in the world  quickly  securely and cost effectively 
we provide dial up connectivity through the world network that is designed to ensure secure access for our clients employees  business partners and customers 
we also provide worldwide virtual private network connectivity for remote offices and local area networks  or lans  that support small office home office and business partner client extranet solutions as well as basic internet access requirements 
we can offer network access on telecommuters home computers  through toll free dial up service or via mobile devices  allowing clients to leverage their investment in other infonet network services 
in recent years  dialxpress has evolved to support established mobile technologies such as global system for mobile communications  or gsm  code division multiple access  or cdma  and high speed circuit switched data  or hs csd  and has gained industry recognition for its next generation mobile access services 
in order to further improve our clients mobility and increase our ability to provide customized solutions  we are working on integrating next generation mobile technologies such as gprs  or general packet radio services and edge  or enhanced data for gsm evolution as well as the use of wireless local area network  or wi fi wlan  hotspots into our service offerings 
we expect our active involvement with operators in the development of the global gprs general packet radio service roaming exchange  or grx  as well as active participation within the wi fi organizations  to benefit us in these efforts 
consulting  integration and provisioning we offer provisioning and implementation services to our clients to implement the last mile part of the solution 
our country representatives provide on the ground support and the local implementation necessary to deliver these services on a global basis 
as part of our integrated solution  the country representatives provision leased lines from a local telecommunications provider to connect our customer sites to the world network 
in addition  our country representatives procure  install and maintain the appropriate customer premise equipment the devices at the customer site that connect the client s internal network with the world network 
we have traditionally provisioned customer premise equipment based on the local market price of the equipment 
in an effort to reduce the costs of provisioning these devices  we are continually trying to negotiate more competitive prices on a global basis 
we believe that few other global data communications service providers can offer similar localized services on a global scale 
furthermore  in remote locations where wireline connectivity is impractical  we provide satellite based clear channel network connections through our vsat connect service 
we currently offer this service in conjunction with hughes global services 
our vsat service has a virtually worldwide footprint and is fully supported hours a day  seven days a week 
we also offer consulting services designed to assist multinational enterprises to better align their information technology investments and local area global networks with their primary applications  end user requirements and business goals 
we also offer consulting services that analyze the relationship between our clients applications and their network 
through our patent pending network analysis program  we provide a customized solution to balance applications and sizing for end user requirements 
application services our application services include messaging and collaboration services  managed extranet services  call center services and security services 
we host e mail services for our clients using internet based messaging software and lotus notes software 
our e mail hosting activities include management of the client servers  software support and services  and e mail translations to short message service  or sms  text messaging and fax 
additionally we provide a means for our clients to leverage the electronic efficiencies of using an extranet to connect customers  suppliers and business partners through our managed extranet service 
our call center services include four levels of customized real time control  enabling our clients to harness what we believe to be the latest call center application technologies 
this service provides our clients with the ability to dynamically monitor and control call routing based on demand 
using an intelligent call routing platform  we manage all inbound call technology  including the provisioning and management of the local numbers in each country  and provide our clients with the ability to effectively route incoming traffic from across europe 
in this way we help our clients improve agent productivity and customer handling 
we offer security services for our clients 
our security services include data integrity using encrypted vpns  digital certificates and one time passwords for authentication  proxy and reverse proxy security gateways  and premise and regional firewall solutions to enforce corporate internet and wan security policies as well as intrusion detection services 
using these services  our clients can implement comprehensive global security measures while controlling the associated costs 
other communications services other communications services include x 
services and other communications services 
as customers transition away from the x 
legacy service to one of our network services  the number of customers in this category continues to decline 
client base we power the networks of multinational clients that are diversified across both industry groups and geographic regions 
we provide our services to many of the world s largest multinationals 
our clients include of the fortune s global for  evidencing the central role we play in the global data communications industry 
in the fiscal year ended march   we added new client contracts  including a net clients that transitioned to our platform from the aucs platform 
we ended the year with over  clients 
no single client comprised more than of our revenues in the year ended march  a substantial portion of our revenues are under contract for one to three years  with contracts for some clients extending even further 
excluding consulting  integration and provisioning services  which are used by substantially all of our clients  of clients use multiple services  benefiting from our broad product portfolio 
to date  our most popular suite of services have been our intranet services  with more than of clients currently using these service 
we also serve a diverse client base  with our largest clients representing various industries such as manufacturing  technology  banking  pharmaceutical and consumer products 
we believe that we attract and retain clients by offering secure  high quality services and support 
in addition  we believe that our clients will continue to use our services because the act of switching service providers not only has the potential to compromise the security and performance of a client s network  but also presents a significant inconvenience 
for example  the customer would have to expend significant time to disconnect and reconnect the service and each service to be switched would experience disruptions during the transfer 
these issues are exacerbated for our larger clients who use many of our services 
as a result  we have kept our overall churn rate measured by annual revenue lost from clients who stop using our services entirely below for each of the past three years 
in addition  our larger clients typically have renewed their contracts with us and continue to use our services 
distribution infonet employs a multi tiered distribution strategy in order to maximize growth  use of our network and economies of scale 
our sales strategy utilizes both direct channels and alternate channels 
direct channels we call our direct channel in country sales and support units our country representatives 
they give us the global reach and strong local presence in the countries in which we operate 
we are present in over countries and territories via our country representatives 
as of march   our consolidated country representatives  those country representatives in which we own a controlling interest  consist of separate country representatives that provide service in countries belgium  canada  france  italy  liechtenstein  luxembourg  mexico  monaco  russia  turkey  the united kingdom and the united states 
our consolidated country representatives accounted for approximately million of our revenues in the year ended march   representing about of total revenues 
in addition to our consolidated country representatives  as of march   we had six country representatives in which we had an ownership interest that is less than fifty percent  and country representatives in which we had no ownership stake 
in the aggregate  our country representatives generated approximately of our revenues in the year ended march  we are the principal service provider to our clients and control the delivery of all infonet services to them on an end to end basis 
we own  control  configure  and manage our network and rely on our country representatives to deliver our services and maintain the world network locally 
we support each of our country representatives by providing regionalized  as well as centralized  sales and marketing support 
in addition  we conduct sales training centrally and within each sales region  and we use computerized training to reinforce classroom training 
each of our country representatives is involved in sales and marketing  operations and client support 
they each maintain a sales force that directly calls on clients  coordinates the contract signing process  manages accounts on a daily basis and serves as the first point of contact for clients  generally providing service in the local language 
we rely on our country representatives to apply their knowledge of the local operating  regulatory and market conditions to market our service offerings effectively to the local client base 
in order to minimize our regulatory hurdles  our country representatives usually enter into the legal contracts with our clients 
sometimes  to adequately address the needs of a potential client  country representatives from different countries will collaborate with each other and make joint sales presentations 
once a new client has signed a contract  we configure the network for the service and coordinate with other country representatives to implement the solution for the client 
our country representatives take a leading role in implementing the last mile part of the solution by provisioning leased lines and installing equipment at the client site 
in addition  the country representatives provide local support for our services by operating local network nodes and  in some cases  housing and operating components of the infrastructure for specific services on our behalf 
we have service agreements with all of our country representatives that govern our relationships 
the agreements are generally non exclusive and are essentially the same for all country representatives  with most providing for an initial three year term with an automatic annual rollover 
these agreements provide the country representatives with the right to market and sell our services  the right to use our trademarks and service marks  access to operational and marketing documentation  and training materials and sessions 
the agreements typically give us the right to recommend prices  the right to jointly set revenue targets with the country representatives  the ability to terminate the agreement if the country representative fails to meet the revenue targets or if targets cannot be agreed upon for two consecutive years  the ability to determine staffing of the local office jointly with the country representatives  and in many cases  the right to appoint one of the three members of an advisory review board  which governs the relationship between us and the country representative 
the agreements outline the fees that the country representatives are required to pay us for access to our network 
in addition  the agreements outline our compensation and pricing arrangements with the country representatives 
alternate channels our alternate channels accounted for approximately of our revenues in the year ended march  they are all entities in which we do not have an ownership interest and are classified into three different categories 
partners 
our partners are generally licensed to sell the totality of our product line 
licensed distributors 
licensed distributors are telecommunication companies that have the same rights and responsibilities as a partner from a sales perspective  but are licensed to sell only specific products or services 
resellers 
resellers are major telecommunication companies and other value added resellers that sell very specific infonet network services under private label as part of a larger service offering to multinational companies in their markets 
in almost all cases  regardless of the alternate distribution channel utilized  clients are fully aware that infonet is the service provider because the installation and other in country support is provided by our direct channel country representative organization 
our revenues for a channel are categorized as alternate channel revenues in those instances where the services sold are provisioned by third parties or where services provisioned by infonet are not sold as infonet services 
in a particular country  we may have more than one sales channel 
currently we believe that we have little channel conflict 
our alternate channels give us the opportunity to create incremental revenues from segments of the market that our direct channels do not reach 
these channels also help us understand different market requirements and competitors  help us increase our total market penetration and allow us to leverage our cost to maintain the world network 
if channel conflict increases in the future  we believe it would be a positive indication that we are covering much larger segments of the global marketplace and thereby increasing our overall revenues 
aucs agreements on october   our three year arrangement with aucs communications services nv  unisource  the then owner of aucs unisource has since been liquidated  and the three companies that own aucs kpn  swisscom and telia was terminated by its terms 
during the three year term of our arrangement with aucs  we purchased services from aucs and provided those services to the distributors which served the aucs end users 
our services agreement with aucs provided us gross margins of approximately on the provision of the services to the distributors 
we also obtained access to multinational corporate clients served by aucs and increased the number of multinational corporate clients to which we could offer our services  with the expectation that  over time  this would result in the normal and transparent transition of some of these multinational clients onto the world network and the use of our services 
as a result of the aucs arrangement  we were successful in transitioning approximately aucs clients to the infonet platform 
subsequent to the termination of the aucs arrangement on october   we no longer receive revenue associated with the provisioning of aucs services 
the aucs arrangement also included a three year management agreement that terminated on october  under the management agreement  we received a fee equal to of the revenues associated with the aucs services  subject to a defined maximum  and an incentive payment based upon the achievement of defined financial performance criteria 
in accordance with the amount claimed  we received an interim payment of euro million approximately million on december  in march  in accordance with the incentive payment agreement  the final incentive fee of euro million was agreed upon by the parties 
in accordance with the incentive payment agreement  of the unpaid incentive fee balance of euro million  euro million approximately million was paid in april and euro million was placed in an escrow account for final disposition pending resolution of certain contingencies as required by the terms of the incentive payment agreement 
in order to memorialize the termination of the aucs arrangement  we entered into a termination and transition agreement as of september  with the parties to the aucs agreements 
the agreement provided for among other things i the provision of certain services by us to aucs and by aucs to us for a limited period of time beginning october  and continuing through april  in order to ensure a smooth transition after the termination of the management agreement and ii the terms of payment of certain fees and costs related to the termination and transition arrangements 
separately  we purchased various network equipment located across europe from the aucs business for approximately million 
promotion and advertising we recognize that strong brand development and increased name awareness are important in obtaining market share 
in addition to print advertising  our promotional  public relations  sponsorships  merchandising and co marketing programs during the year continue to promote infonet s name in our target marketplace 
in the fiscal year ended march   we concluded many successful enhancements to our corporate marketing activities that we believe have increased awareness  garnered industry awards and enhanced the stature of our corporation 
these enhancements include continuation of our marketing campaign based on the phrase insight matters  expansion of our industry analyst program  designed to increase awareness in this group  and the creation of a new client e newsletter 
additionally  our media relations program has substantially increased the number of publicly available reports describing our services and capabilities 
in an effort to further develop brand awareness  we advertise in the world s leading newspapers and business magazines and in high traffic locations such as major international airports 
we have sponsored an entry in the rose parade  in pasadena  california  for the past two years and we are a major sponsor of the alinghi  the swiss challenge to the america s cup  which won the america s cup for each of these sponsored events is broadcast worldwide on television  providing us increased name awareness and recognition 
as a result of these efforts  we were awarded the superior achievement in branding and reputation  or sabre  award in the category of reporting measurement for our public relations calendar and score card grid system 
industry participants and competition the recent volatility in the data communications industry has witnessed several bankruptcies  including kpnqwest and worldcom  inc  creating uncertainty and deflationary pricing pressures 
in light of these circumstances we believe that many existing and potential competitors have retreated from the global managed data communications marketplace 
our potential competitors include long distance and local telecommunications providers  systems integrators  cable television and satellite communications companies  software and hardware vendors  wireless telecommunications providers and national and regional isps 
in addition  there are established and start up companies that have built global networks and are offering data communications as part of a comprehensive communications services portfolio 
our chief global competitor is france telecom equant  followed by at t and mci previously known as worldcom 
in addition  we also compete regionally with some of the regional incumbents  such as bt ignite and deutsche telekom in europe and ntt in asia 
the markets in which we compete are highly fragmented 
most participants specialize in specific segments of the market  such as access or backbone provisioning  managed access  for example  intranets and extranets  application services  for example  web hosting  security services  and communication services  for example  ip based voice  fax and video services and commercial e mail 
many of these existing and potential competitors have greater financial resources  larger customer bases  greater name recognition and more established business relationships within the industry than we do 
we believe that competition in the data communications market is mainly a function of the ability to offer a broad variety of innovative services available on a reliable network supported by an effective service organization 
in addition  in order to meet all of the needs of multinational enterprises  managed data network providers need to establish a comprehensive stewardship role over their clients networks that embraces all network technologies and focuses on each individual client s business processes 
we believe that the key factors to our competitive position in this market are our global reach  our full range of value added services  our ability to provide customized solutions  our solid financial position  the reliability of our extensive global network  and our extensive country representative structure and the support it provides to our clients 
the world network we own and operate the world network  one of the world s largest seamless advanced fiberoptic global data networks in terms of geographic coverage  which is accessible from over countries 
our network supports the major data communications protocols that allow us to offer a broad range of services 
our network architecture allows us to respond quickly to our clients changing needs for increased bandwidth capacity  reliability and security while continuing to manage data traffic patterns efficiently 
because we manage our network on an end to end basis  we are well positioned to control and customize the services we deliver to our clients 
clients can access the world network either directly using a dedicated line or through dial up services by connecting to a local node 
if a client uses a dedicated line to access the world network  one of our country representatives leases the line with speeds up to mbps from a local telecommunications provider 
our dial up services offer remote access to the world network through the local public telecommunications networks 
we plan to offer additional access methods and adapt them to our backbone for increased efficiency 
among those services planned or under review for clients that require higher speed access are digital subscriber line and broadband wireless remote access 
clients can choose to have us manage their entire provisioning and support at and between each client location 
the world network is based upon a four tier hierarchical structure  which we believe provides a competitive advantage because it allows for efficient traffic management  higher performance and reduced cost 
this four tiered hierarchical structure is comprised of high bandwidth global switching nodes  mid bandwidth regional switching access nodes  in country local access solutions and extended client access solutions 
global switching node locations we use our global or backbone switching nodes to cost effectively aggregate and distribute interregional network traffic flows 
they are the major backbone switching locations within the world network 
each of these node locations is equipped with marconi atm switches  interconnected by fiber optic transmission trunks ranging from megabits per second  or mbps  to gigabits per second  or gbps  and is capable of accepting multiple channel inputs of data 
there are backbone switching node locations presently in service and located in countries 
some of these nodes also serve as regional switching access nodes 
regional switching access node location we use our regional switching access nodes to aggregate regional traffic and provide access to the world network for clients with bandwidth intensive applications 
these nodes provide both switching and access services within the world network 
each of these node locations is equipped with marconi  cisco  and nortel devices 
the nortel passport switches provide frame relay capability as well as high capacity access to the backbone switching nodes through our backbone 
the cisco hub and access routers provide high capacity local access for our clients and aggregation services for regional internet protocol  or ip  traffic 
the cisco hub routers can also use the nortel passport switches for connection to the backbone switching nodes to exchange data interregionally 
our marconi equipment enables us to provide atm services 
we have regional switching access node locations in countries  each supported by onsite engineers 
dedicated customer access speeds range from mbps to mbps 
in country local access solutions in order to better serve our clients from a network access perspective  we are implementing several key initiatives aimed at further expanding our reach within certain countries and metropolitan areas  reducing local access costs 
these initiatives include in country solutions 
our in country initiatives are designed to expand our reach throughout certain countries by increasing the number of local access nodes available to our clients 
this expanded reach brings us closer to our clients 
in addition  our in county solutions are transport technology neutral  thus enabling us to deliver a complete suite of network services at a reduced cost 
one of our in country solutions involves contracting with local telecommunications providers to establish in country networks  or icns  in some of our high traffic locations 
we have successfully deployed icns in the united states  france  germany  the united kingdom  belgium and italy 
we are also evaluating additional countries for deployment later this year 
as another part of our in country solutions  we intend to deploy our own local access nodes in several countries during fiscal year both of our expansion strategies rely on the use of extended access points of presence  or eapops 
although we are currently using these eapops for transport only  we may convert them into full service nodes in the future 
by using an end to end managed eapop solution  we expect to realize significant cost reductions while maintaining quality levels of service 
the optical strategy 
optical technology deployed in the network is the next evolutionary step for us 
while it is not our current intent to create a separate optical backbone  we plan to continue to deploy optical network capabilities as an enhancement to our current infrastructure 
we intend to limit this deployment in fiscal year to areas in which we have heavy capacity requirements and where the deployment will result in overall cost reductions 
we are primarily implementing this solution in metropolitan areas 
we have already deployed metropolitan networks in new york city  london and los angeles  with optical connectivity to seattle  boston and san jose  and several more metropolitan rings are currently in progress 
we plan to connect these metropolitan rings using optical technology to allow for greater efficiency in our network 
extended client access solutions we provide access to the world network from over countries through interconnections with other global  regional and national networks 
in remote locations where terrestrial connections or alternative paths for specific high availability applications are not available  we use satellite technology in collaboration with hughes electronics to provide clients access to the world network via satellite links 
backbone capacity our backbone connects all nodes on the world network 
traditionally  we have obtained backbone capacity from major telecommunications carriers through short term leases 
as bandwidth prices began to drop and purchased bandwidth became available  we replaced some of our short term leases on major international and regional routes with more economical longer term solutions 
the term purchased bandwidth  which is used throughout this document  refers to transmission capacity contractually acquired under long term prepaid leases  capitalized leases and irus indefeasible rights of use 
in the current competitive market  we have reverted to short term leases to improve our flexibility and to take advantage of ongoing cost reductions 
we have invested significant capital resources to expand and upgrade our network in order to maintain our competitive advantage 
network protocols our network strategy is to support a wide range of managed data communications services over a common infrastructure 
as such  our global network infrastructure supports a variety of protocols including atm  frame relay  ip and x 
our existing network offers seamless managed data communications services on a worldwide basis 
we have implemented mpls class of service for our ip clients  which allows them to prioritize the delivery of their data by application and ensure that mission critical applications receive a higher priority than other data transmissions 
this capability also exists for our atm and frame relay clients 
our network is able to support broadband services that require asynchronous networking capabilities for example  video services  as well as provide transport for aggregated data between our regional switching access nodes and our global switching nodes 
our network is the transport platform for our managed data communications services  and allows for the efficient and high speed transport of voice  video and data traffic over a single network 
this capability not only enables us to further leverage our network assets  but also allows us to capitalize on the demand for anticipated new service offerings that combine voice  video and data 
furthermore  as client demand for additional bandwidth  faster transmission speeds and enhanced service quality increases for applications such as desktop videoconferencing  we believe our investment in atm technology will position us as a leading provider of these services 
network management we manage our network and monitor its operation hours a day  seven days a week through two network control centers  one located in los angeles and the other in brussels  and a centralized global customer assistance center  or gcac  located in los angeles 
the gcac oversees  coordinates and supports our local  in country help desks 
we offer a certification program that trains our local help desks to assume additional direct support responsibilities historically reserved for our centralized gcac  thus allowing the local organizations to provide a higher level of direct technical support to their clients 
to date  local support organizations have been certified  and we anticipate extending certification to additional locations in fiscal year as an additional level of technical support for the gcac  we provide highly trained and experienced technicians  our global technical support  or gts  team  located in los angeles  brussels and tokyo to resolve those customer needs that cannot be addressed by the first point of contact local help desk or gcac 
as with our certification program for general customer support  we have implemented the gts extension program that trains technicians in our local organizations to provide this higher level of support offered by gts in country 
to date  the gts extension program has been implemented in seven countries 
our total customer support operations  including those of our country representatives  consist of multilingual  technologically experienced staff in over countries 
our network management infrastructure is an integral component of the seamless delivery and management of our suite of services 
we proactively monitor the real time status of over  active network interfaces that provide performance feedback on a daily basis 
consistent information is available to all global support entities using trouble tracking services  network alerts and alarms  change configuration and security management processes 
we continue to enhance these capabilities by adding automation tools and providing on going training 
network security 
we have built and maintain an advanced security and control structure 
because we manage our global network from end to end  we maintain central control of network access  operations and maintenance 
we protect our network through various means including firewalls  intrusion detection platforms  network address translation  filtering and network architecture structures  as well as various dedicated network and remote access authentication processes 
backup network control centers and nodes 
each of our network control centers serves as the primary control center during its regional business day 
as a result  both locations are fully equipped to assume complete network control responsibilities for our network in case of a major disaster or other outage at one of our control centers 
in addition  in order to lower the potential exposure from major failures or disasters affecting a node  or any individual network connection  we have implemented dual connections to all primary network nodes  along with alternate paths around any non functional primary node 
this structure provides for multiple paths through both nodes and network connections and is designed to minimize potential network disruptions to our clients worldwide 
circuit diversity 
with rare exceptions  nodes are connected to at least two other nodes via redundant connections so that no single connection failure will result in the isolation of the node 
the failure of a connection results in the automatic rerouting of traffic to one or more alternate network paths 
in the event of a node outage  transit traffic is automatically rerouted to paths around the failed node 
in addition  we have  over our operating history  sought to ensure that our circuits are  to the extent practicably possible  diversely routed so that a major failure by a carrier in a given route does not result in a total network outage to our clients 
disaster recovery 
under our disaster recovery plan  we distribute our critical operations over two global regions  which constantly share information with one another 
each of our network control centers and gcac are essentially self contained units located in diverse geographic regions  and thus provide natural disaster backup for each other as described below network control centers in los angeles and brussels  global customer assistance center in los angeles  national customer assistance centers in countries  including certified help desks in countries  and global technical support centers in los angeles  brussels and tokyo with extended support in the netherlands  belgium  germany  france  japan  singapore and the united states through the gts extension program 
within the backbone  we have minimized the risk of node outages by placing our nodes in highly secure facilities and by requiring dual cable entrances  diversely routed circuits  uninterruptible power supplies and back up generators 
however  clients who need quick recovery from disasters or failures affecting a node can supplement their service with our failure recovery service  which provides access to an alternate infonet node via a leased line  dial up access backup or satellite services 
we provide this service on an automatic or manual backup basis 
quality standards we perform ongoing quality system audits and conduct client satisfaction surveys 
as a result  we receive constant performance feedback to ensure that our quality systems meet client needs and our guaranteed network availability 
we have achieved iso registration for our quality management system 
intellectual property our success and future revenue growth depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property and to obtain future patent or other proprietary protection 
we rely primarily on trademark  copyright and trade secret laws  as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods  to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
these measures may not provide meaningful protection for our intellectual property 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how  which we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with our employees  partners and clients 
we also utilize trademarks on nearly all of our products  for which we have both registered and unregistered trademark protection in the united states and certain foreign countries 
the specifics of trademark protection vary depending on the location  but provided we continue to use the trademark and follow the requirements for renewal  we expect our trademark protection to last indefinitely 
we believe that our trademarks are of great value because of their contribution to the market identification of our products 
in addition  we have filed several us patent applications relating to various software programs that allow us to collect and process certain performance statistics relating to a client s network and thereby develop optimal network solutions 
we may not receive any patents as a result of these applications or future applications 
even if patents are issued  the claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any future patents could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any rights granted under such patents may not provide us with meaningful protection 
the failure of any patents to adequately protect our technology would make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products and negatively affect our ability to competitively exploit our patented products and technologies 
in addition  we may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our us patent applications 
even if foreign patents are granted  effective enforcement in foreign countries may not exist 
it is possible that our confidentiality agreements will be breached or will not be enforceable  and that we will not have adequate remedies for any such breach 
in addition  despite our precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  to develop similar technology independently or to design around our patents 
in certain foreign countries  effective copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited 
we may find it necessary to engage in litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others 
in addition  we may be sued by other parties who claim that we have infringed their patents or misappropriated or misused their trade secrets 
litigation involving patents  trademarks  copyrights and proprietary technologies can often be protracted and expensive and  as with litigation generally  the outcome is inherently uncertain 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  even if claims against us are not valid or successfully asserted 
regulation in the united states with regard to the vast majority of our business  we operate as an unregulated provider of information services  as that term is defined in the communications act of  as amended  and as an enhanced service provider  as that term is defined in the federal communications commission  or fcc  rules 
the fcc currently does not regulate the data communications systems we operate in the united states because our special services features enhance the private data network facilities offered to clients by altering the format of the information transmitted in connecting clients to data switches or processors 
these networks generally are referred to as value added networks and are configured for the data transfer requirements of the specific clients 
the fcc also does not regulate value added services such as voicemail  facsimile  database access  storage and retrieval services  store and forward messaging services  network management services  and internet access  which are not encompassed in the fcc s definition of basic telecommunications services and which we refer to as enhanced services 
collectively  these services are classified for regulatory purposes as information services 
in most foreign jurisdictions we operate as a value added network provider 
one of our subsidiaries  infonet telecommunications corporation  has obtained authorizations to provide non facilities based resale interexchange long distance services in a number of states in the united states 
resale interexchange services are generally subject only to light regulation by the fcc and the states 
we foresee this subsidiary serving only multinational enterprises to which we also provide unregulated enhanced data services 
we do not intend for this regulated business to become a significant focus of our overall business strategy 
other than this one subsidiary  our operations currently are not regulated by the fcc or the states 
in addition  although we do not otherwise operate as a common carrier  our subsidiary  infonet broadband services corporation  holds authorizations to provide international services between the united states and other countries on a common carrier basis 
these authorizations require us to comply with specified regulatory filing and reporting requirements 
if we begin to offer regulated telecommunications services as a common carrier  or if the fcc determines that our services constitute regulated telecommunications services  we will become subject to additional rules and policies 
if we fail to comply with those rules and policies  we could become subject to enforcement actions or investigations  either of which could result in substantial penalties  including the loss of our authorization to provide telecommunications services 
various existing us federal and state regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proposals which could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which the telecommunications industry operates 
additionally  the fcc continues to refine its international service regulations in order to promote competition  to reflect and encourage deregulation in foreign countries and to reduce international accounting rates toward cost  and some foreign governments are actively considering regulation of some of the services we offer 
we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings or events  or the impact they may have on the telecommunications or information services industries generally  or on us particularly 
among other things  these changes may increase competition and alter our ability to compete with other similar service providers  make it more difficult to introduce new services or make it more expensive to provide our existing services 
we cannot assure you that future legislative  regulatory or judicial changes in the united states or in other countries in which we operate will not have a material adverse impact on our business 
regulation in non us markets although most countries impose little or no regulation on our network operations  the laws and regulations governing our services are under review in many countries outside the united states and are subject to change 
consistent with our strategy of obtaining licenses or authorizations to provide regulated services when we are able to obtain more favorable facilities or capacity lease terms or interconnection arrangements  we have obtained facilities based authorization to provide telecommunications services in several countries 
we may also obtain authorizations in additional countries to meet our business needs 
in some countries we are able to obtain the more favorable arrangements we seek simply by notifying the relevant government authority that we intend to provide certain services 
in other countries  we are engaging in discussions with foreign regulators to determine whether we must apply for authorization in order to acquire or lease facilities or interconnect with other carriers 
employees as of march   including our consolidated country representatives  we had a total of approximately  employees  of which are located internationally 
there are approximately additional personnel charged with selling and supporting infonet services who are employed by our non consolidated country representatives  all of whom are based internationally 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with employees to be good 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected  the trading price of our class b common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
if we cannot maintain or increase prices  our revenue may decline and our losses may increase 
as the telecommunications market continues to experience transitional changes  we face several factors that may negatively affect our pricing weak global economic conditions  the strengthening of incumbent operators may lead to high local access costs  requiring that we discount other components of our service offering in order to offer competitive pricing  as carriers and operators emerge from bankruptcy  they may continue with disruptive pricing practices in order to retain or gain market share  as national operators extend their services into regional markets they may lead with price  which leads to a reduction of pricing power by global multinational data network service providers  and the emergence of information technology consultants has created more aggressive customers  which serves to deflate pricing in the sector 
as a result of these and other factors  our clients frequently transition to different and more cost effective solutions offered by us when they renew their contracts 
consequently  we may provide comparable services to our clients at the same or even reduced prices under the renewed contracts 
we refer to this as price erosion 
we expect price erosion to continue for at least the near term 
the markets we serve are highly competitive and our competitors may have much greater resources to commit to growth  new technology or marketing 
our current and potential competitors include other companies that provide data communications services to multinational businesses  systems integrators  national and regional internet service providers  or isps  wireless telecommunications providers  cable television and satellite communications companies  software and hardware vendors  and long distance and local telecommunications companies 
we expect that the data communications market will attract other established companies and multinational alliances 
further  there are established and start up companies building global networks and beginning to offer data communications as part of a comprehensive communications services portfolio 
our competitors  which may operate in one or more of these areas  include companies such as france telecom equant  at t and mci previously known as worldcom 
our country representatives and suppliers  or their respective affiliates  are or could also become competitors either directly or through strategic relationships with our competitors 
in addition  our six significant stockholders  kddi corporation  kpn telecom bv  swisscom ag  telefonica international holding bv  telia ab and telstra corporation limited  are among the world s largest telecommunications companies 
these stockholders  each of which has significantly greater resources than infonet  have in the past  are currently  or may in the future  provide service offerings that are directly or indirectly competitive with our services 
we have in the past and expect in the future to encounter competition as a result of the formation of global alliances among large telecommunications providers  such as the merger between france telecom and equant 
several of our current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger customer bases  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the telecommunications industry than we do 
we cannot be sure that we will have the resources or expertise to compete successfully in the future 
our competitors may be able to develop and expand their network infrastructures and service offerings more quickly  adapt better to new or emerging technologies and changing client needs  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products  and adopt more aggressive pricing policies 
some of our competitors may also be able to provide clients with additional benefits at lower overall costs 
in particular  the growth rate in the data communications industry may have begun to decline and  in response  several of our competitors have begun to lower the prices of their services  including data communications services  in an effort to attract a greater market share 
we have responded  where appropriate  with similar price reductions  however  we may be unable to maintain this reduced pricing for an extended period of time and we may be unable or unwilling to meet any future price reductions 
if our competitors lower their prices further or maintain their existing prices for an extended period of time and we are unable or unwilling to make similar adjustments to our pricing  our sales could decline 
in addition  financial and competitive pressures have caused some of our competitors to seek protection from creditors  and in certain cases  renegotiate their operating cost structure with vendors  creditors and other third parties  including in some cases  in connection with bankruptcy proceedings 
as a result  these companies may be able to operate more competitively in the future 
we believe it is likely that  in light of the financial troubles that many telecommunications companies are currently experiencing  there will be a greater number of competitors who may lower their operating costs in bankruptcy or otherwise  or consolidate with other competitors with greater resources  any of which could increase competition in ways that may adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives unless we successfully  timely and cost effectively expand our network and manage our growth 
we must continue to develop  expand and technologically improve our network infrastructure as the number of our clients  the amount of information they wish to transport and the number and sophistication of services they demand  increases 
the development  expansion and technological improvement of our network infrastructure requires substantial financial  operational and management resources 
if we fail to anticipate demand for data transport or client preferences for various services  we may not be able to adequately expand or improve our network 
if we do not expand or improve our network rapidly enough  our existing network hardware  traffic management and other systems and operating facilities may become over stressed and operate inefficiently 
a variety of factors  uncertainties and contingencies that are beyond our control  will affect the continued expansion of our network  such as the availability of transmission capacity  price of transmission capacity  continued deployment of our atm based network  availability of wireless transmission capacity and technologies  local regulations  and availability of country representatives or other third party sales and support channels 
currently  there is substantial volatility in the market price for transmission capacity 
we cannot assure you that actual expansion time and cost requirements will be met in accordance with our plans 
a failure to continue to expand our network may have a material adverse effect on our ability to service our clients  offer competitive and technologically advanced services and to grow our business 
we currently rely on a relatively small core management team 
if we experience significant growth in our operations  it could place a significant strain on our management  financial controls  operating and accounting systems  personnel and other resources 
if we grow  we must not only manage demands on this team but also increase its management resources by  among other things  continuing to expand  train and manage our employee base and maintain close coordination among our technical  accounting  finance  marketing and sales staff 
in addition  our network infrastructure  technical support and other resources may not be sufficient to facilitate growth 
if we do not successfully manage our growth  we may be unable to adequately support our clients communications needs in the future 
our ability to retain our clients and provide them with new and innovative service offerings may suffer if we are not able to keep up with the rapid technological developments in our industry 
the global communications industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes  such as continuing developments of alternative technologies for providing high speed data communications 
we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business 
we may rely in part on third parties  including some of our competitors and potential competitors  for the development of and access to communications and networking technologies 
we expect that new services and technologies applicable to our market will emerge 
new products and technologies may be superior or render obsolete the products and technologies that we currently use to deliver our services 
our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to anticipate and adapt to technological changes and evolving industry standards 
we may be unable to obtain access to new technologies on acceptable terms or at all  and may therefore be unable to offer services in a competitive manner 
if the global communications industry fails to set standards to allow for the compatibility of various products and technologies on a timely basis or at all  any new products and technologies may not be compatible with our existing technologies 
if we are unable to maintain our country representative and third party sales channel relationships  then our ability to sell and support our services may be negatively impacted 
we are and will continue to be significantly dependent on a number of third party relationships  including relationships with our non consolidated country representatives and partners  to market and support our services 
many of our arrangements with third party providers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of either party 
we cannot assure you that these third parties regard our relationship with them as important to their own respective businesses and operations  that they will not reassess their commitment to us at any time in the future  that they will meet their sales targets or that they will not develop their own competitive services 
we may not be able to maintain our current relationships or form new relationships with third parties that supply us with clients or software and related products that are important to our success 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our existing or prospective relationships will result in sustained business partnerships  successful service offerings or the generation of significant revenues 
we rely on our country representatives for most of the support and local implementation necessary to deliver our services on a global basis 
we also rely on these country representatives for insights into local operating and market conditions 
the failure of these country representatives to perform their tasks or operate their businesses effectively could  in turn  adversely affect our business 
in addition  we sometimes provide our country representatives with equipment and installation services to facilitate our market participation 
we may have limited recourse  or potentially no recourse  if they do not perform the services that we expect them to perform  and we may not be able to recover our equipment 
our recourse may be limited because the local laws and judicial system may not be effective in enforcing our rights 
also  our country representatives are parties to the legal contracts with clients 
if these agreements are terminated  the clients have no legal obligation to purchase our services 
in addition  we frequently depend on our country representatives to obtain the regulatory approvals and licenses that we need to offer our communications services in other countries 
in some cases  we cannot determine whether they are complying with local regulatory laws or taking the steps necessary to maintain proper licenses and permits 
if any of our country representatives lose their telecommunications licenses  whether by violating local laws or otherwise  our business could suffer 
we depend on the telecommunications companies within our alternate sales channel for a significant part of our revenues  and the loss of a significant number of these entities could limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenues 
our alternate sales channel represents our indirect sales force and consists of various telecommunications companies that integrate some or all of our services into their product offerings 
in the fiscal year ended march   revenues from our alternate sales channels accounted for of our total revenues 
as a result  we depend upon the continued viability and financial stability of these entities  as well as upon their continued interest and success in selling our products 
within our indirect sales channel  our services are often marketed under the name of the telecommunications company itself  not infonet 
increased pricing competition resulting from the slowing of the growth rate within the data communications industry is making it more difficult for these entities to generate sufficient revenues 
many of the telecommunications companies within our alternate sales channel have experienced difficult financial circumstances 
some have already initiated bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings  and others may experience similar problems in the near future 
the loss of one or more telecommunications companies within our alternate sales channel could have a significant impact on our revenues 
if our vendors cease providing service to us for any reason  our operations may be adversely affected  operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase and our net loss may increase 
due to financial and competitive pressures in some industries  including the telecommunications industry  a number of our bandwidth providers have experienced severe financial difficulties and related operational problems 
some have even initiated bankruptcy or liquidation proceedings 
additional vendors may experience similar problems in the future 
these financial and operational problems of our vendors have in some cases resulted in  and could in additional cases result in  an inability of these vendors to provide us with the services we have contracted for  including  in some instances  a loss of our rights under our agreements for purchased bandwidth 
in the bankruptcy context in particular  it is unclear how indefeasible rights of use agreements  or irus  will be characterized under the federal bankruptcy code or analogous laws of other jurisdictions 
we cannot predict at this time how a bankruptcy court will treat an iru 
if additional financially struggling vendors cease operations or otherwise cease providing us the services we contracted for  or if a bankruptcy court concludes that our vendor agreements may be validly rejected in bankruptcy or the agreements are otherwise adversely affected  then we may be required to replace any assets required to run our business which have been adversely affected 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to replace these assets on favorable terms or at all 
as a result  we may lose any amounts we have paid to obtain the services contracted for and our operations could be adversely affected  our operating expenses could increase and our net loss could increase 
delays or expense in receiving transmission capacity or delays in equipment delivery or loss of our equipment suppliers could impair our ability to provide service  the quality of the services we can provide and our results of operations 
we acquire  by lease or by purchase  transmission capacity from a wide range of suppliers  to connect client premises over the local loop via incumbent local exchange carriers networks to our network and for other network connections 
we have from time to time experienced short term delays in receiving the requisite transmission capacity from suppliers 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain local loop connections to our service points at favorable prices  as this access may be controlled by a single service provider 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these services in the future within the time frames required by us and at a reasonable cost 
any failure to obtain transmission capacity on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost in a particular market  or any interruption of local access services  could have an adverse effect on our ability to provide service or our service levels 
the switches and routers used in our network are provided primarily by nortel networks corp 
and cisco systems inc these suppliers also sell products to our competitors and may become competitors themselves 
we may experience delays in receiving components from our suppliers or difficulties in obtaining their products at commercially reasonable terms 
if we are required to seek alternate sources of switches and routers  we are likely to experience delays in obtaining the requisite equipment we need and may be required to pay higher prices for that equipment  increasing the cost of expanding and maintaining our network 
if our network infrastructure is disrupted or security breaches occur  we may lose clients or incur additional liabilities 
we and other network services providers may in the future experience interruptions in service as a result of financial difficulty of our suppliers  fire  natural disasters  power loss  or the accidental or intentional actions of service users  current and former employees and others 
although we continue to implement industry standard disaster recovery  security and service continuity protection measures  including the physical protection of our plant and equipment  similar measures taken by us or by others have been insufficient or circumvented in the past 
we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient or that they will not be circumvented in the future 
unauthorized use of our network could potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in the computer systems of  or transmitted by  our clients 
furthermore  addressing security problems or interruptions of service may result in interruptions  delays or cessation of services to our clients 
these factors may result in liability to us or our clients 
because we have international operations  we face additional risks related to global political and economic conditions 
we operate in and intend to expand further into international markets 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain or build the necessary global communications infrastructure in a cost effective manner or compete effectively in international markets 
there are risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
these include  among others unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  challenges in staffing and managing foreign operations  differing technology standards  employment laws and practices in foreign countries  weaker intellectual property protections  political  social and economic instability  costs of services tailored to specified markets  imposition of currency exchange controls  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could adversely affect our operations 
in addition  a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from european clients 
therefore  although our historic revenue growth has not been materially adversely affected by general economic conditions  a future slowdown or recession in the european economy  in particular  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenues we receive from our international operations or increase our costs as measured in us dollars 
we invoice substantially all sales of our services to our country representatives and our indirect sales channel partners in us dollars 
accordingly  most of our revenue is denominated in us dollars 
our consolidated country representatives may derive their revenue and incur maintenance and other expenses in currencies other than us dollars 
to the extent that  either directly or through our consolidated country representatives  our expenses in a currency other than the us dollar do not match our revenue in that currency  our operating results are subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
our non consolidated country representatives and alternate sales channel partners operating results may also be subject to foreign currency exchange risk because they are obligated to pay us in us dollars but may derive their revenue in currencies other than the us dollar 
our obligations  together with the obligations of our country representatives and sales channel partners whose revenue are in foreign currencies may be subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations if those currencies change relative to the us dollar 
furthermore  we  our country representatives or our sales channel partners may become subject to exchange control regulations which might restrict or prohibit our or their conversion of currencies into us dollars 
we cannot assure you that future exchange rate movements will not have a material adverse effect on our sales  gross profit or operating results 
if members of our senior management team leave infonet  then our ability to operate our business may be negatively affected 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our senior management  particularly jose a 
collazo  president  ceo and chairman of the board of directors  akbar h 
firdosy  our chief financial officer  paul a 
galleberg  our chief legal officer and other members of our executive management team 
the loss of the services of mr 
collazo  mr 
firdosy or mr 
galleberg  or any other present or future key employee  could have a material adverse effect on the management of our business 
we have employment agreements with mr 
collazo  mr 
firdosy and mr 
galleberg 
we do not maintain key person life insurance for any of our personnel 
competition for highly skilled personnel can be intense and the success of our business depends on our ability to attract  retain and manage key personnel 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
as we continue to grow  we will need to hire additional personnel in all areas 
competition for personnel throughout the data and voice communications industries has been and may again become intense 
we may be unable to attract or retain key employees or other highly qualified employees in the future 
we have from time to time in the past experienced  and we expect to continue to experience in the future  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications 
if we do not succeed in attracting sufficient new personnel or retaining and motivating our current personnel  our ability to provide our services could diminish 
our corporate structure may grant you only limited voting power and discourage a takeover attempt because our class a common stockholders will control the outcome of stockholder votes 
our class a common stockholders  in the aggregate  also beneficially own approximately of our class b common stock  which  combined with their class a stock  equals more than of our voting power 
these stockholders exercise control over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
we have entered into a stockholders agreement with all of our class a stockholders 
this stockholders agreement provides that each class a stockholder holding at least million shares of our class a common stock has the right to nominate one of our directors  and each class a stockholder agrees to vote all of its shares in favor of the directors nominated by the other class a stockholders and for our president as a director 
in addition  provisions contained in our revised certificate of incorporation  our revised bylaws  delaware law and our stockholders agreement could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
our revised certificate of incorporation requires the approval of both of the voting power of the class a common stock and two thirds of the voting power of the class a and class b common stock voting together to take certain significant corporate actions such as changes to our share capital  or a merger  consolidation or liquidation 
based on the current ownership of our class a common stock  we will not be able to undertake these actions without the approval of each of our class a stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our class b common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
if we or our class a stockholders sell additional shares of our class b common stock  it could cause the market price of our class b common stock to decline 
all of our class a stockholders have the right to convert their class a common shares into class b common shares at any time on a one for one basis 
if our shareholders sell a large number of shares of class b common stock in the market  either through the conversion and sale by one of our class a shareholders of its class a common shares into class b common shares  or otherwise  if the perception exists that large sales could occur  or if there are sales by us  our management or our stockholders  the market price of our class b common stock could decline 
these sales  or the possibility that these sales may occur  also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
our quarterly operating results may vary  which may cause volatility or a decline in the price of our class b common stock 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are in our control 
these factors include  among other things the size and timing of significant equipment and transmission capacity purchases  the timing of new service offerings  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the timing of our network expansion  the loss of significant clients  market acceptance of data communications generally and of new and enhanced versions of our services in particular  the length of our contract cycles  our success in expanding our sales force and expanding our distribution channels  and taxes 
in addition  a relatively large portion of our expenses are fixed in the short term  particularly with respect to global communications capacity  depreciation  real estate expenses and personnel  and therefore our results of operations are particularly sensitive to fluctuations in revenues 
due to the factors noted above and the other risks discussed in this section  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our results of operations 
quarterly results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in this event  the price of our class b common stock may fall 
volatility of our stock price may expose us to securities litigation 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of global communications companies have been extremely volatile 
the market price of our class b common stock could be affected by  among other things quarterly variations in our operating results  technological innovations of ours or of our competitors  changes in government regulations  conditions in the international data communications and telecommunications industries  increased price competition  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  and changes in general economic conditions and volatility in the financial markets 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a public company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
on december   the first of nine complaints alleging securities fraud was filed against us and several of our current and former officers and directors 
the nine lawsuits have been consolidated and a consolidated class action complaint has been filed on behalf of public investors who purchased our securities during the period from december  through august  the consolidated class action complaint alleges that defendants made misrepresentations and omissions regarding our aucs channel in our form s registration statement and the accompanying prospectus for our initial public offering and in other statements during the class period 
on march   the first of three shareholder derivative suits was filed against us as a nominal defendant and certain current and former members of our board of directors 
on august   the three actions were consolidated 
the current complaint alleges that the defendants breached their duties toward infonet either through their alleged participation in  or alleged failure to adequately oversee  the purported conduct and events that are alleged in the securities class action lawsuits described above and an alleged violation of california corporations code section for a more detailed description of these lawsuits  see item legal proceedings 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this litigation and it could result in substantial costs to us and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
we face uncertain and changing regulatory restrictions which could limit our operating flexibility and increase our costs 
with the limited exceptions discussed below  in general the services we provide are not currently subject to direct regulation by federal communications commission  or the fcc  or the states 
future changes in legislation or regulation  however  could result in some aspects of our current operations becoming subject to regulation by the fcc or a state of the united states 
if the fcc or a state seeks to regulate some segments of our activities as telecommunications services  we cannot predict the impact  if any  that this future regulation or regulatory changes would have on our operations 
one of our subsidiaries  infonet telecommunications corporation  has obtained authorizations in a number of states in the united states to provide non facilities based resale interexchange long distance services 
resale interexchange services are generally subject only to light regulation by the fcc and the states 
in addition to the licenses held by infonet telecommunications corporation  we currently hold fcc common carrier authorizations to provide international telecommunications services between the united states and other countries 
we also have obtained facilities based authorizations to provide telecommunications services in several other countries and may obtain authorizations in additional countries to meet our business needs 
our licenses subject us to the jurisdiction of the relevant regulatory body which  in turn  may require that we make specified regulatory filings and pay attendant fees 
future regulatory  judicial and legislative changes in countries in which we operate may impose additional costs on us or restrict our activities 
in addition  regulators or third parties may raise material issues with regard to our compliance with applicable regulations 
failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations in the united states  or other countries in which we operate  could prevent us from carrying on our operations cost effectively 
the law relating to the liability of online services companies and internet access providers for data and content carried on or disseminated through their networks is currently unsettled and could expose us to unforeseen liabilities 
it is possible that claims could be made against online services companies and internet access providers under us or foreign law for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  or other theories based on data or content disseminated through their networks  even if a user independently originated this data or content 
several private lawsuits seeking to impose liability upon online services companies and internet access providers have been filed in us and foreign courts 
while the united states has passed laws protecting internet access providers from liability for actions by independent users in limited circumstances  this protection may not apply in any particular case at issue 
in addition  some countries  such as china  regulate or restrict the transport of voice and data traffic in their jurisdiction 
the risk to us  as an internet access provider  of potential liability for data and content carried on or disseminated through our system could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to this liability 
this may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue some of our services 
our ability to monitor  censor or otherwise restrict the types of data or content distributed through our network is limited 
failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations in particular jurisdictions could result in fines  penalties or the suspension or termination of our services in these jurisdictions 
the negative attention focused upon liability issues as a result of these lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely impact the growth of public internet use 
our professional liability insurance may not be adequate to compensate or may not cover us at all in the event we incur liability for damages due to data and content carried on or disseminated through our network 
any costs not covered by insurance that are incurred as a result of this liability or alleged liability  including any damages awarded and costs of litigation  could harm our business and prospects 
item properties our headquarters are located in a facility consisting of approximately  square feet in el segundo  california  which we purchased for million in march pursuant to a year mortgage 
in march  we paid off this mortgage in full 
in december  we acquired a new  approximately  square foot office building adjacent to our existing headquarter facilities to accommodate current and future growth 
we purchased the building for cash in the amount of million 
this building requires interior improvements ranging from million to million 
we initially plan to use one floor  approximately  square feet  for ourselves and offer the unoccupied space for lease to third parties until such time as we need it to accommodate additional growth 
in addition  we lease sales offices domestically and internationally in a variety of locations 
these leases generally have terms of three to five years 
none of these offices is critical to our success  and we believe that suitable additional or alternative space is available on commercially reasonable terms as needed 
we also lease facilities for our network control centers  global customer assistance center and engineering offices around the world 
we lease these facilities at commercial rates under standard commercial leases 
we believe that suitable space for these operations is generally available on commercially reasonable terms as needed 
item legal proceedings on december   the first of nine complaints alleging securities fraud was filed against us and several of our current and former officers and directors in the united states district court  central district of california

our operating income loss also varies from quarter to quarter due to timing of expenses related to provisioning of our services 
our net income loss varies from quarter to quarter due to changes in income tax expenses related to our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
quarterly results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against our entire net domestic deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance is discussed more fully under critical accounting policies below

we provide cross border managed data communications services to multinational corporations worldwide 
we offer our services to our clients directly through country representatives and indirectly through alternate sales channels consisting of major international telecommunications carriers and value added resellers 
we deploy a broad array of fully managed data communications services over our reliable  secure  and high quality global network  which we refer to as the world network 
the world network is an extensive and versatile network that can be accessed by our clients from over countries 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes during the year ended march   we filed a request for determination from the internal revenue service  or irs  regarding the propriety of establishing an intangible asset  for tax purposes only  arising in connection with a september transaction with three stockholders in which we obtained access to certain customers served by aucs and cash of million in exchange for the issuance to the three stockholders of million shares of our class b common stock 
in november  we received a favorable determination from the irs that an intangible asset relating to the access to these customers was created by the transaction 
the intangible asset  which may be amortized in our tax returns over a period of fifteen years  was determined to have a value of million 
accordingly  in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million  representing the deferred tax benefit assuming an estimated tax rate 
united states securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  transfer of nonmonetary assets by promoters or shareholders  requires that transfers of nonmonetary assets to a company by stockholders in exchange for stock prior to or at the time of a company s initial public offering be recorded at the transferor s historical cost basis 
accordingly  for financial statement purposes  the access to these customers was valued at the stockholders basis of correspondingly  the million credit resulting from the recognition of the deferred tax asset was reflected as an increase in stockholders equity  net of directly related costs 
at march   the unadjusted net book value of our deferred tax assets totaled approximately million  which was principally comprised of the remaining carrying value of the intangible asset discussed above of approximately million and the benefit associated with domestic tax losses  incurred during the years ended march  and march   of approximately million 
the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  require a valuation allowance when  based upon currently available information and other factors  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
sfas no 
provides that an important factor in determining whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is whether there has been sufficient income in recent years and whether sufficient income is expected in future years in order to utilize the deferred tax asset 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence  such as cumulative losses in recent years 
the existence of cumulative losses in recent years is an item of negative evidence that is particularly difficult to overcome 
during our fiscal fourth quarter end  based on our estimates of fiscal year operating performance  we determined that it is likely that we will incur a cumulative loss for the three year period that includes fiscal years  and we believe this determination represents negative evidence such that sfas no 
requires that we realize a valuation allowance related to our intangible deferred tax asset 
accordingly  in the fourth quarter we recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million against our entire net domestic deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a valuation allowance until sufficient evidence exists to support its reversal 
also  until an appropriate level of profitability is reached  we do not expect to recognize any domestic tax benefits in future results of operations 
we believe that our determination to record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on an estimate of future taxable income in the united states  which is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that are remote in time and may or may not occur  and because the impact that recording a valuation allowance has on the assets reported on our balance sheet is material 
we operate  and are subject to income taxes  in many foreign jurisdictions and in many taxable jurisdictions around the world 
as a result  our reported tax provisions are based  in part  on our judgments as to the amount of income that may be subject to tax in certain foreign jurisdictions 
our management has discussed these critical accounting estimates and judgements with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this related disclosure 
purchased bandwidth we monitor and evaluate the viability of the network service providers from which we have purchased bandwidth 
the term purchased bandwidth refers to transmission capacity contractually acquired under long term prepaid leases  capitalized leases and indefeasible rights of use  or irus 
in instances where the network services provider is determined to be no longer viable and any disruption of service is permanent  we will write off the remaining net book value of the asset 
included in our property  equipment and communication lines is purchased bandwidth with a net book value of million as of march  purchased bandwidth with a net book value of approximately million as of march  was purchased from a company which has filed a voluntary petition for chapter protection with the united states bankruptcy court or made analogous petitions in other jurisdictions and has not completed those proceedings 
we refer to these assets as at risk purchased bandwidth 
while the company has not completed its bankruptcy proceedings  we believe  based on information available to us  that the bankruptcy proceedings will not affect our purchased bandwidth  and we have not recognized an impairment of the purchased bandwidth as of march  however  if we experience a permanent disruption in services on these facilities as a result of these bankruptcy proceedings  a charge may be recorded to write off the purchased bandwidth 
during the fiscal years ended march  and march   we wrote off purchased bandwidth with a net book value of million and million  respectively 
at march   we reported that our additional at risk purchased bandwidth had a net book value of million 
this purchased bandwidth  which did not include the purchased bandwidth that was written off during the year ended march   is no longer considered to be at risk as the carriers have emerged from bankruptcy proceedings or have otherwise had a change in circumstances such that we believe a permanent disruption of service from these carriers is unlikely 
the purchased bandwidth that was written off during the year ended march  was determined to be at risk during the year ended march  finally  during the year ended march   we determined that the million of purchased bandwidth referred to in the preceding paragraph is at risk as a result of bankruptcy proceedings 
we believe that our determination not to recognize an impairment of the at risk purchased bandwidth is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that are remote in time and may or may not occur  and because the impact that recognizing an impairment of the purchased bandwidth would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet would be material 
if  at march   we were to recognize an impairment of the at risk purchased bandwidth in the total amount of our current at risk purchased bandwidth  our property  equipment and communication lines would decrease from million to million  or our determination relating to the value of the purchased bandwidth is subject to change 
the court in the bankruptcy proceeding may determine that we are not entitled to use of the bandwidth 
if this occurs  we would likely experience a permanent disruption in service on that bandwidth and the fair value of the bandwidth would likely be significantly decreased 
at that point we would record an impairment charge equal to the net book value of the purchased bandwidth 
our management has discussed this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this related disclosure 
long lived assets we monitor and evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  we recognize an impairment loss in the amount of the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
our most significant long lived asset subject to impairment is our owned network  which had a net book value of million as of march  we currently estimate that undiscounted cash flows will be sufficient to recover the value of our long lived assets 
however  our estimates of cash flows are subject to change 
should our estimates of future undiscounted cash flows indicate that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we would be required to determine the fair value of those assets and record a loss for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of those assets 
we believe that our determination not to recognize an impairment loss on our long lived assets is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that are remote in time and may or may not occur  and because the impact that recognizing an impairment loss would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet would be material 
if our estimated future undiscounted cash flows were to decrease a hypothetical ten percent  the long lived assets continue to be recoverable and we would not be required to recognize an impairment of our long lived assets 
our determination relating to the value of the long lived assets is subject to change because it is based on our estimates of future cash flows 
we believe that the undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover the carrying value of our long lived assets 
our management has discussed this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this related disclosure 
valuation allowance for revenue credits and accounts receivable we make estimates of future client credits for the services provided during the reporting period through the analysis of historical trends and known events 
management s judgment and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the revenue reserves associated with discounts earned on special client agreements and billing reserves for pricing changes and client disputes 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue adjustments if management projections differ from actual results 
similarly  our management must make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable including historical bad debts  client concentrations  client credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the valuation allowance for revenue credits and accounts receivable was million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the million bad debt expense related to the bankruptcies of several of our resellers 
if management over or under estimated the reserves by a hypothetical ten percent  the valuation allowance for revenue credits and accounts receivable would decrease or increase by million 
we believe that our valuation allowance for revenue credits and accounts receivable is a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to change and dependent upon events that are remote in time and may or may not occur  and because the impact that recognizing an impairment loss would have on the assets reported on our balance sheet would be material 
our determination relating to the valuation allowance is subject to change because it is based on management s current estimates of required reserves and potential adjustments 
our management has discussed this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed this related disclosure 
outsourcing and management agreements with aucs on october   our three year arrangement with aucs communications services nv  unisource  the then owner of aucs unisource has since been liquidated  and the three companies that own aucs kpn  swisscom and telia was terminated by its terms 
services agreement during the three year term of our arrangement with aucs  we assumed aucs obligations to provide various services to its clients 
our services agreement with aucs provided us gross margins of approximately on the provision of these services 
the revenues and expenses resulting from this arrangement are referred to in this report as outsourcing services revenues and expenses 
we also obtained access to multinational corporate clients served by aucs and increased the number of multinational corporate clients to which we could offer our services  with the expectation that  over time  this would result in the normal and transparent transition of some of these multinational clients onto the world network and the use of our services 
as a result of the aucs arrangement  we were successful in transitioning approximately aucs clients to the infonet platform 
subsequent to the termination of the aucs arrangement on october   we no longer receive revenue associated with the provisioning of aucs services 
through march   we transitioned clients from the aucs platform to our services  substantially all of which were transitioned during the year ended march  the revenues generated from transitioned clients during the year ended march  were approximately million per quarter at the time of their transition 
the transitioned clients include clients who  over the course of our outsourcing arrangement with aucs  had also become our clients by purchasing infonet services  and clients who had regional networks and have since discontinued our service 
this resulted in a net increase of infonet clients 
during prior periods  most of the revenues from these clients were reported as outsourcing services revenues 
as clients transitioned from the aucs platform to our services  revenues and the number of clients by channel generally shifted from alternate sales channels to country representatives direct channels 
as of march   we no longer have outsourcing services clients  this compares to outsourcing services clients direct channel clients and alternate sales channel clients as of march  the decrease in alternate sales channel clients includes clients that transitioned to our services and primarily became non outsourcing services direct channel clients 
for each of the fiscal years ended march   and  outsourcing services revenues have been reported in consulting  integration provisioning services for access related services and other communications services for all other services 
to the extent the business has transitioned onto the infonet platform  these revenues are no longer reflected in other communications services  but instead are reported in the appropriate product based category 
access related services for the transitioned clients continue to be reported in consulting  integration and provisioning services 
revenues by region were not affected by the transition because revenues from these clients when they were reported as outsourcing services were included in the emea region and continue to be included in the emea region after the transition to our platform 
our expenses related to outsourcing services revenues had been approximately of the revenues we received from clients using the aucs platform and we had reported this expense as country representative compensation 
to the extent that transitioned business is managed by our non consolidated country representatives  we make country representative compensation payments  based on current agreements  to the respective country representative 
to the extent the business is sold through alternate channels  there is no country representative compensation  but we now incur incremental expense for multinational support compensation 
the country representative compensation and support compensation are reported in communication services costs and integration and provisioning costs based on the related service 
additionally  the incremental bandwidth and related costs  network operations  and sales  general  and administrative expenses associated with these revenues are also included in the appropriate category 
with the termination of the aucs services agreement  we no longer have the contractual right to a gross margin of approximately 
the revenue that has transitioned to the infonet platform now generates approximately the same profit margins as existing infonet business 
management agreement the aucs arrangement also included a three year management agreement that terminated on october  under the management agreement  we received a fee equal to of the revenues associated with the aucs services  subject to a defined maximum 
during the years ended march   and  we recognized approximately million  million  and million  respectively  in management fees 
the decrease in management fees for the year ended march  principally resulted from the termination of the management agreement half way through the fiscal year 
the management agreement also provided for an incentive fee payment payable upon termination of the management agreement based upon our achieving certain performance criteria 
the incentive fee payment was equal to the amount by which aucs entities adjusted ebitda losses as defined in the management agreement for the period from october  to september  was less than euro million 
in accordance with the terms of the management agreement  we presented a claim for the incentive fee payment 
we received and recognized as revenue a payment of euro million approximately million on december  in march the parties entered into an incentive payment agreement in which we agreed upon the final incentive fee payment of euro million  which includes the euro million already paid 
in accordance with the incentive payment agreement  euro million of the unpaid portion euro million of the incentive fee was placed in an escrow account for final disposition pending resolution of certain contingencies 
we expect this resolution to occur by march  accordingly  we have recognized as revenue euro million approximately million during the three months ended march  during the year ended march  we recognized euro million approximately million as incentive fee revenues 
termination agreement in order to memorialize the termination of the aucs arrangement  we entered into a termination and transition agreement as of september  with the parties to the aucs agreements 
the agreement provided for among other things i the provision of certain services by us to aucs and by aucs to us for a limited period of time beginning october  and continuing through april  in order to ensure a smooth transition after the termination of the management agreement and ii the terms of payment of certain fees and costs related to the termination and transition arrangements 
separately  we purchased various network equipment located across europe from the aucs business for approximately million 
components of revenues we measure revenue by three different means by service  by distribution channel and by region 
revenues by service our revenues are derived from providing a broad range of integrated service solutions to our multinational clients worldwide 
the revenue is classified in the following categories network services which includes revenues from intranet  internet  multimedia and wireless remote access services  consulting  integration and provisioning services which includes revenues from consulting  design  installation and implementation of each client s particular networking needs  satellite connectivity  and our global connect services  whereby we install and manage leased lines and customer premise equipment at the client s site to enable the client to access the world network and use our network services  applications services which includes revenues from messaging  collaboration  managed extranet  call center  security and other value added services  and other communications services which includes revenues from x 
transport services and other communications services as well as service access fees 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues from the sale of network services  specifically intranet services  wireless remote access and internet services 
intranet services comprise a majority  approximately  of our network services revenues 
we expect that network services will continue to constitute the largest component of our revenue base going forward 
we also anticipate that a significant portion of our future revenue growth will come from network services and consulting  integration and provisioning services 
our other communications services revenues include outsourcing services under the arrangements with aucs  which terminated in october see discussion above 
excluding outsourcing services  other communication services revenues have declined over the last two fiscal years 
we expect this decline to continue as our clients transfer to non x 
based transport services 
revenues by distribution channel we offer our services through country representatives and through alternate sales channels such as major telecommunication service providers  value added resellers  and licensed distributors 
in the year ended march   country representatives contributed of our total revenues  while alternate sales channels contributed of our total revenues 
most of the outsourcing services revenues have been categorized as alternate sales channel revenue 
country representatives as of march  we had country representatives  consolidated and non consolidated  which together provide services in more than countries and territories 
our consolidated country representatives are those in which we own  directly or indirectly  greater than a equity interest 
our consolidated country representatives provide services in countries and accounted for approximately million  or approximately of our total revenues  in the year ended march our service agreements with our country representatives generally give us the right to recommend prices for services  set revenue targets jointly  determine staffing jointly  in many cases appoint one of the three members of the advisory review board  and terminate the agreement if the country representative fails to meet the revenue targets or if we cannot agree on revenue targets for two consecutive years 
in addition  each agreement outlines the compensation and pricing arrangements with the country representatives 
established rates and support charges are generally the same for all country representatives throughout the world 
our country representatives determine the prices they charge clients  in accordance with our recommended prices and standard discounts  and enter into contracts with clients to provide services using the world network 
we bill our country representatives and recognize the full amount of revenues for all of our services delivered to the clients 
the country representatives bill us for the sales and support services they provide  which we account for as country representative compensation 
the country representative bears the risk of collection from contracts they enter into directly with clients as well as the exchange rate risk 
alternate sales channels our alternate sales channels including partners  licensed distributors  and resellers sell all or a portion of our suite of services in their territories to clients that require one or more of our global communications services that the alternate sales channel does not independently supply 
our relationships with our alternate sales channels typically are governed by multi year contracts  under which we provide services to our alternate sales channels who then solicit orders for our services or resell our services to clients on terms our alternate sales channels determine 
revenues by region we provide our services throughout the world  with revenues billed and costs incurred in more than countries and territories 
we are organized into three regions americas  europe  middle east and africa emea  and asia pacific 
due to the multinational nature of our client base  the regional revenues are not based on where the services are provided  but rather on the jurisdiction in which we invoice our services 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues in the emea region  and we expect that revenues from that region will continue to comprise the largest component of our revenue base going forward 
our asia pacific region has experienced the most significant growth from the year ended march  to the year ended march  we anticipate that we will experience a significant portion of our future revenue growth in the americas and emea regions 
pricing the pricing for our services differs depending on the services provided  the speed of service  geographic location and capacity utilization 
in the case of services permitting dedicated client access to the network by leased circuit  pricing generally depends more on the nature and capacity of the service provided than on actual usage 
for example  the pricing for a connection to be used for intranet services generally consists of a monthly charge for the connection and the bandwidth access provided through the connection 
pricing for dedicated access services is therefore largely based on access equipment and bandwidth 
in the case of remote access services  actual usage and geographic location are more relevant to the pricing determination  as the client is generally charged based on the duration of each connected session 
once a base service is set  additional factors are taken into account such as charges for additional network services  breadth of the service  and discounts for larger volume clients that are prepared to guarantee specific revenue levels 
price erosion as the telecommunications market continues to experience transitional changes  we face several factors that may negatively impact our pricing weak global economic conditions  the strengthening of incumbent operators may lead to high local access costs requiring that we discount other components of our service offering in order to offer competitive pricing  as carriers and operators emerge from bankruptcy  they may continue with disruptive pricing practices in order to retain or gain market share  as national operators extend their services into regional markets they may lead with price  which leads to a reduction of pricing power by global managed data network service providers  and the emergence of information technology consultants has created more aggressive clients  which serves to deflate pricing in the sector 
as a result of increasing competition in the markets we serve  our clients frequently transition to different and more cost effective solutions offered by us when they renew their contracts 
consequently  we may provide comparable services to our clients at the same or reduced prices under the renewed contracts 
we refer to this as price erosion 
for the year ended march   we estimate our price erosion of multi year contracts up for renewal to have been approximately on average  a figure greater than we have historically seen 
the price erosion on some renewals  depending on the size and needs of the client  has been greater than 
we expect this trend of historically high price erosion to continue for at least the near term 
in order to counter the effect of price erosion  we launched a targeted program aimed at retention and growth of existing clients 
this program establishes the metrics to calibrate performance and provides the sales organization with the tools needed to retain and grow existing clients in the face of severe pricing pressures at the time of contract renewal 
client contracts the client contracts generally include an agreed upon price schedule that details both fixed and variable prices for contracted services 
the client contracts generally have a term of one to three years  however  when clients implement a number of our services  they may choose to extend the contracts for a longer period of time 
our country representatives can easily add additional services to existing contracts  enabling clients to increase the number of locations through which they access our network  increase the speed of that access  increase the sophistication of the services they use  or extend the term for existing services 
revenue recognition we record revenues for network services  consulting  integration and provisioning services  applications services  and other communications services when the services are provided 
such services are provided under client contracts  which generally have a term of to years 
consistent with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the amount of revenue recognized from contracts entered into by non consolidated country representatives is the gross amount of revenue billed to the end user client 
the amount of end user revenue to which the non consolidated country representative is entitled for sales and support services is reflected as country representative compensation  which is included in communications services costs and integration and provisioning costs in our results of operations 
installation fee revenues are amortized over the average customer life 
amounts for services billed in advance of the service period and cash received in advance of revenues earned are recorded as advance billings and recognized as revenue when earned 
an allowance for customer credits is accrued concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
components of costs and expenses expense reclassification previously  we classified our operating costs and expenses into the following four categories country representative compensation bandwidth and related costs network operations selling  general and administrative these categories of expenses were described in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  as demand for our various services and our client requirements change  our cost structure has changed 
specifically  over time our clients requirements for customer premises based services have grown 
additionally  our clients continue to require in country support 
these factors  combined with the impact of price erosion  have resulted in costs related to customer premises based equipment and in country support comprising a larger percentage of our total expenses than we have experienced historically 
these costs increase and decrease directly with increases and decreases in revenue and are  therefore  variable 
to provide greater visibility into the relationship of these variable expenses to our total expenses as well as revenue  we have eliminated the country representative compensation expense category and have introduced two new expense categories  namely communication services costs and integration and provisioning costs 
we now classify our operating costs and expenses in the following five categories communication services costs integration and provisioning costs bandwidth and related costs network operations selling  general and administrative previously  country representative compensation was entirely comprised of amounts we paid to our country representatives for the sales and support services the country representatives provided to our clients that were sold in that country representative s country 
these costs are variable and increase as the revenues we receive from our country representatives clients increase 
during fiscal   and  country representative compensation also included amounts paid to aucs for services provided under the outsourcing agreement 
support compensation reflects the amounts paid to our country representatives for the support services  including provisioning of local access lines to connect clients to the world network  they provided to our clients that were sold in other countries 
these costs are also variable and increase as the amount of multinational support our clients require increases 
previously  support costs were reported in sales  general and administrative expenses 
both of the above mentioned costs are now reported in communication services costs or integration and provisioning costs  depending on the product to which they relate  as described below 
communication services costs communication services costs  including both country representative compensation and support compensation  consist of costs associated with network services  application services and other communication services revenues 
the country representative compensation was previously reported in the country representative compensation category reference a in reclassification table below 
the support compensation expense was previously reported in the selling  general and administrative category reference b in reclassification table below 
integration and provisioning costs our integration and provisioning costs include expenses related to global connect revenues  or the provisioning of the last mile whereby we install and manage leased lines and customer premise equipment at the client s site to enable the client to access the world network and use our network services 
these expenses are paid in the form of country representative compensation and support compensation to country representatives as well as local access costs paid directly to local telecom service providers 
integration and provisioning costs also include the amortization of installation expenses over the life of the client contract 
the country representative compensation was previously reported in the country representative compensation category reference c in reclassification table below 
the support compensation expense was previously reported in the selling  general and administrative category reference e in reclassification table below 
the local access costs  incurred by consolidated country representatives for provisioning the last mile services for the client  were previously reported in the bandwidth and related costs category reference d in reclassification table below 
bandwidth and related costs our bandwidth and related costs are primarily comprised of leasing and amortization expenses associated with the leasing or purchasing of network circuits 
prior to  we typically obtained backbone capacity through short term leases 
we bear leasing expenses regardless of whether we lease directly or indirectly through another entity that may lease communications lines locally on our behalf 
as bandwidth prices began to drop and capacity became available for purchase  we began to replace some of our short term leases on major international and regional routes with much more economical longer term solutions 
currently  a substantial portion of our backbone network was purchased and the amortization of these assets is included as an expense 
in the current competitive market  we have reverted to short term leases to improve our flexibility and to take advantage of ongoing cost reductions 
however  we retain the flexibility to obtain long term capacity when it is economical to do so 
bandwidth and related costs also include related equipment  maintenance and personnel costs 
network operations our network operations expense includes costs associated with our network management  operations and support activities related to the world network 
these costs include personnel  occupancy  maintenance  equipment depreciation  outsourcing costs and other network related costs 
selling  general and administrative selling expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and incentive compensation related to our consolidated country representative sales force  as well as costs related to providing centralized sales and marketing support for our non consolidated country representatives 
our selling expenses also include promotion  advertising  travel and entertainment expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other compensation  and occupancy costs for executive  financial and accounting  human resources  legal and other administrative personnel  as well as company wide management incentive related costs 
the table below summarizes the reclassification from the four expense categories reported in previous periods columns to the five new expense categories rows 
we believe this expanded presentation of expenses provides a better understanding of the behavior of our expenses as our product and channel mix changes and improves visibility into our expenses

compensation charges related to stock option and stock appreciation rights grants in april  we granted options to employees for the purchase of approximately million shares of our class b common stock at an exercise price of per share pursuant to our stock option plan 
the stock option plan was a book value plan  which converted to a market value plan upon the close of our initial public offering  creating a new measurement date for the stock options 
since the exercise price of these options was substantially below the price to the public of per share in the offering  we record a non cash compensation charge over the five year vesting period of the options 
the amount of this charge is a function of the public offering price of our class b common stock 
based upon the price of our class b common stock in our initial public offering  this charge will total approximately million  of which approximately million  million  million and million was recognized in the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the remaining charge will be amortized to expense at a rate of approximately million per quarter through december  during december  we issued approximately million stock appreciation rights  or sars  and during the fiscal year ended march  we issued approximately  sars to employees pursuant to our sars plan 
the sars vest per year  commencing in january  and were indexed to our class b common stock at a base price of per share 
we recorded a compensation charge in each quarter of the vesting period based upon the difference between the exercise price and market value of our class b common stock during the vesting period 
the total amount of this charge is a function of the price of our class b common stock during the vesting period 
during the fiscal year ended march   these charges were approximately million 
as of march   approximately  sars had been forfeited by employees 
during the fiscal year ended march   we amended our sars plan to provide for a tandem feature which allows for the settlement of the sars with shares of our class b common stock as an alternative to a cash settlement 
the amended sars plan provides that the sars may be settled with stock or cash at our sole discretion 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock options or award plans  we are accounting for the tandem award as equity instruments and the plan  as amended  as a fixed plan under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the amendment to the sars plan created a new measurement date 
we credited stock related compensation by approximately million to reflect the stock price at the new measurement date 
the remaining unrecognized compensation expense of approximately million at march   will be amortized ratably over the remaining vesting period at a rate of approximately  per quarter through december  during each of the fiscal years ended march   and  these charges were approximately million 
additionally  we grant stock options to certain consultants and other non employee personnel

in that regard  we are providing the following information to demonstrate the total revenues received as a result of the aucs arrangement and operations of our business excluding the impact of aucs over the last three years 
we believe this information is useful to investors in understanding our ongoing operations 
you should note that revenues from the infonet platform include revenues from clients that were formerly outsourcing services clients but that transitioned to the infonet platform 
accordingly  the revenues represented as infonet platform revenues may not be indicative of what our revenues on the infonet platform would have been without the aucs arrangement

revenues from applications services increased by million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  as clients previously on the aucs platform transitioned to the infonet platform 
these aggregate increases of million were offset by a decrease of million in revenues from other communications services and a decrease of million in revenues from consulting  integration and provisioning services 
the decrease in other communications services and consulting  integration and provisioning services are primarily due to million and million decreases  respectively  in outsourcing services revenues discussed in more detail below 
the decrease in consulting  integration and provisioning services related to outsourcing revenues was offset by an increase in global connect services for non outsourcing clients of approximately million 
a million incentive fee was recognized in the year ended march  there was no corresponding amount in the year ended march  outsourcing services revenues decreased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this decrease is the result of clients previously on the aucs platform ceasing to use aucs services or transitioning to our services on the world network 
the revenues from clients that were transitioned to the world network were million in the three months ended december   which was the first full quarter after the termination of the aucs agreement 
with the termination of the aucs services agreement on october   we will not receive any additional outsourcing services revenue after that date 
of the million decrease in outsourcing services revenues  million was in other communication services and million was in consulting  integration and provisioning services 
excluding the effect of the decrease in outsourcing services revenues and the million incentive payment  revenues increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the increase is primarily attributable to consulting  integration and provisioning services  which increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the increase in consulting  integration and provisioning services is primarily attributable to an increase of million in our global connect services that enable our clients to access the world network and use our network services 
network services increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  intranet services  the largest component of network services revenues  increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the increase in network services is offset by the price erosion we experience as existing clients transition to our more cost effective solutions as well as the effect of substantial sales resources applied to transitioning the clients from the aucs platform to the infonet platform 
applications services increased by million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the growth included revenues from clients previously on the aucs platform that have transitioned to the infonet platform 
other communications services  excluding outsourcing services  decreased by million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  as clients migrate to more advanced  non x 
based transport services 
despite the impact that price erosion is expected to have on our network services revenues  we expect that network services revenues will continue to constitute the largest component of our revenue base going forward 
we anticipate that a significant portion of our expected future growth  if any  will come from network services and consulting  integration and provisioning services 
revenues by distribution channel revenues from our country representatives increased million  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the increase in revenues was principally the result of the million incentive payment recorded during the fiscal year ended march  the number of our country representatives increased from as of march  to as of march  the number of our country representative clients decreased slightly from  as of march  to  as of march  the decrease in the number of clients includes a decline of outsourcing services clients 
excluding outsourcing services clients  country representative clients increased by  from  as of march  to  as of march  this growth included clients previously on the aucs platform that have transitioned to the infonet platform 
these transitioned clients and their respective revenues were previously reported in our alternate sales channels as outsourcing services clients and revenues 
the increase in revenues from our country representatives was partially offset by the decline in outsourcing services revenues and the effect of price erosion on our core business as existing clients transition to our more cost effective solutions 
excluding the effect of the decrease in outsourcing services revenues and the million incentive payment  revenues from country representatives increased by million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this growth included revenues from clients previously on the aucs platform that have transitioned to the infonet platform 
revenues from our alternate sales channels decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march   as a result of a decline in our alternate sales channel partners clients from clients as of march  to clients as of march  the decline represents a decline of outsourcing services clients of whom transitioned to infonet services and non outsourcing services clients 
excluding the effects of the decrease in outsourcing services revenues  revenues from alternate sales channels decreased million  or  from million in the march  to million in the year ended march  the decline in non outsourcing services clients of and revenues of million is the result of the reclassification of certain channels from alternate channels to country representatives during the year 
the decrease is also attributable to price erosion and the financial challenges faced by some of our major alternate sales channels that are telecommunication carriers 
we believe that while these alternate sales channels have been focusing on the new challenges facing telecommunication carriers  they have failed to enter into agreements with a sufficient number of new clients to overcome the client attrition that these channels typically experience 
revenues by region revenues billed on a regional basis in the americas increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  due primarily to the million incentive payment 
excluding the incentive payment  revenues billed in the americas decreased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  due primarily to price erosion as clients transition to our more cost effective solutions 
revenues billed in the emea region decreased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this decrease is the result of a million decrease in outsourcing services revenues  offset by an increase in revenues of million related to the addition of new clients  including those that have transitioned from the aucs platform to the infonet platform 
excluding outsourcing services revenues  revenues in the emea region increased by million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  revenues increased in the asia pacific region by million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this increase was largely attributable to our increased sales efforts in this region combined with the overall growth in this market

excluding the write offs  bandwidth and related costs decreased by  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  lease expense  the largest component of bandwidth and related costs  increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  amortization of purchased bandwidth decreased million  from million to million over the period as a result of the write off of purchased bandwidth from a bankrupt network service provider 
see the critical accounting policy on purchased bandwidth and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
network operations expense increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this increase is primarily due to a million increase associated with the support of clients previously on the aucs platform that have transitioned to the infonet platform 
depreciation expense related to network equipment increased by million over the prior year period 
the remainder of the increase was related to the increased costs associated with our network management  operations and support activities  personnel costs and other network operations expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this increase is primarily a result of a million bad debt expense in the year ended march  related to the bankruptcies of some of our resellers 
sales and marketing personnel related expenses increased million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  due to increased sales and marketing efforts 
also contributing to the increase was administrative expenses  which increased by million and advertising expense  which increased by million due to the launch of new advertising initiatives 
offsetting these increases was stock related compensation charges which decreased million  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  primarily as a result of the forfeiture of unvested options held by terminated employees and a million non cash charge related to the acceleration of vesting of the options of a terminated employee in the prior year 
operating loss increased by million  from a loss of million in the year ended march  to a loss of million in the year ended march  because of increased expenses as discussed above 
other income expense decreased million  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  this decrease reflects a decrease in interest income of million  from million to million  due to lower interest rates and lower cash balances as funds were used for capital expenditures during fiscal year interest expense decreased by million  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march   due to decreased borrowings and lower interest rates 
other  net decreased by million primarily because the year ended march  included an impairment loss of million related to the reduction of the carrying value of a non marketable investment and the year ended march  included the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and swap termination costs of million associated with our repayment of long term debt 
provision for income taxes increased from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  primarily because of a full valuation allowance on our net domestic deferred tax assets and the absence of any domestic tax benefits on losses incurred during the year ended march  the provision of this valuation allowance is discussed more fully under critical accounting policies above 
net loss increased from a loss of million in the year ended march  to a loss of million in the year ended march  due to the factors described above 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  revenues revenues by service revenues decreased million  or  from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  the decrease in revenues was principally the result of a decrease of million  or  in revenues from other communications services  which were partially offset by increases of million  or  in revenues from network services and million  or  in revenues from consulting  integration and provisioning services 
most of the growth in revenues from network services came from a million increase in sales of intranet services 
most of the growth in revenues from consulting  integration and provisioning services was the result of our clients need for local access services to connect to the world network 
the decrease in revenues from other communications services was primarily the result of a million decrease in outsourcing services revenues discussed in more detail below and an expected million decline in our mature x 
transport services as our clients migrated to more advanced  non x

provision for income taxes decreased from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  primarily because of decreased income and  to a lesser degree  by tax benefits from foreign subsidiary loss utilization 
net income loss decreased from income of million in the year ended march  to a loss of million in the year ended march  due to the factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during the year ended march  was million compared to million during the year ended march  this change was primarily a result of an increase in net loss of million offset by changes in deferred income taxes  which provided cash of million in the year ended march  compared to million in the year ended march  the year ended march  included a write off of communications lines of million 
other current assets provided a source of cash of million in the year ended march  compared to a use of cash of million in the year ended march  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to a use of cash of million during the year ended march  this fluctuation was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property  equipment and communication lines of million from million in the year ended march  to million in the year ended march  additionally  the year ended march  included a use of cash of million in investments in unconsolidated affiliates for a new business investment 
cash used in financing activities for the year ended march  was million compared to million for the year ended march  this fluctuation was primarily the result of repayments of million of long term obligations and purchases of treasury stock of million during the year ended march  in december  we acquired a new  approximately  square foot  office building adjacent to our existing headquarter facilities to accommodate current and future growth 
we purchased the building for cash in the amount of million 
the building will require interior improvements ranging from to million 
in november  our board of directors authorized the expenditure of up to million over a two year period to repurchase shares of our common stock 
from the inception of the program through march   we had spent approximately million to purchase approximately million shares at an average price of per share 
in december  we repaid all of our debt outstanding under our  senior secured credit facility  amounting to million  and terminated all unfunded commitments under that facility 
as a result of this early extinguishment  maximum borrowing available to us under the senior secured credit facility was reduced by million 
the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other costs associated with the termination of the credit facility totaling million is reported in other  net in the year ended march  in march  we repaid all of our debt outstanding in connection with our mortgage loan  amounting to million  and terminated all commitments in connection with that loan 
the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and other costs associated with the termination of the mortgage loan totaling million is reported in other  net in the year ended march  as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  working capital of million and total assets of  million 
subsequent to march  we received euro million approximately million in cash for the incentive fee payment related to the aucs arrangement 
based on current plans and business conditions  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
we expect capital expenditures for the next twelve months to approximate million 
although we do not expect to at this time  it may be necessary for us to increase capital expenditures to replace purchased bandwidth acquired from service providers who may be unable to provide an acceptable level of service 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
over the past two years  rising prices for some of our supplies have been offset by decreasing prices for other services 
in particular  our per unit costs for leased lines and circuits has generally decreased over this period 
however  we cannot assure you that per unit costs for leased lines and circuits will continue to decline or that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 
commitments and contingencies the estimated values of our contractual obligations as of march  are as follows in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations vendor contract purchase obligations voice services purchase obligations operation and maintenance payment obligations total represents a contract with a vendor which contains a minimum purchase commitment to the vendor over a five year period of approximately million 
the contract provides for an early termination for convenience with a termination fee that declines over the period of the contract 
the contract expires on december  at march   the aggregate remaining purchase commitment under the contract was million and the fee for early termination for our convenience was approximately million 
during the fiscal year ended march   we entered into an agreement with a vendor whereby we are committed to purchase voice services at a minimum level of million per year for a three year period 
we are committed to pay operation and maintenance costs to the providers of our purchased bandwidth over the life of the contracts 
over the next five years  we are committed to incur approximately million per year 
after five years the aggregate commitments are approximately million 
we are obligated to purchase certain customer premise equipment owned by our non consolidated country representatives should the customer cancel its contract prior to certain time limits agreed to between us and the country representative generally to months and the country representative is unable to redeploy the equipment within three months 
the aggregate buy back value of the customer premise equipment at march   is approximately million 
actual buybacks of customer premise equipment have historically averaged less than  per year 
purchased bandwidth with a net book value of approximately million at march   had been purchased from network service providers which filed voluntary petitions for chapter protection with the united states bankruptcy court or made analogous petitions in other jurisdictions on or before march   and which have not yet completed these bankruptcy proceedings 
information available to us as of march  indicates that it is more likely than not that the network services obtained from those providers who had not yet completed their bankruptcy proceedings as of march  will continue to be provided under the original terms of each of the agreements 
we are of the opinion that the carrying values of the related assets are not impaired 
we will continue to monitor the situation and will record a charge if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets is no longer realizable 
new accounting pronouncements on april   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changes the method of accounting for goodwill to a test for impairment and requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
total goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet at march  is approximately million 
goodwill amortization for the fiscal years ended march  and was approximately  and  respectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant effect our financial position or results of operations 
the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
during fiscal  we completed the first step of the transitional goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
and determined the fair value of the reporting unit to be in excess of its carrying value 
as a result  the second step of the impairment test was unnecessary 
sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations which becomes effective for us on april  addresses the obligations and asset retirement costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
it requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded when incurred instead of over the life of the asset 
the asset retirement costs must be capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded balance  either a gain or loss will be recognized at settlement 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant effect on our financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which arise during the normal course of business from changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
a discussion of our primary market risks associated with our foreign currency transactions  available for sale securities  and long term debt exposure is presented below 
foreign exchange risk we conduct our operations in more than countries and territories around the world in a number of different currencies 
there is exposure to future earnings when foreign exchange rates change and certain receivables  payables and intercompany transactions are denominated in foreign currencies 
we monitor our exposure to foreign currencies through our regular operating activities and have not historically used derivatives to hedge foreign exchange risk 
we invoice substantially all sales of our services to our country representatives and sales channel partners in us dollars 
however  many of our country representatives derive their revenues and incur costs in currencies other than us dollars 
to the extent that the local currency used by the country representative fluctuates against the us dollar  the obligations of the country representative may increase or decrease significantly and lead to foreign exchange losses or gains 
we assume the exchange rate risk for our consolidated country representatives  however  our non consolidated country representatives assume the exchange rate risk under our country representative structure 
our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations historically arose primarily from outsourcing services and assignment agreements with aucs  which were denominated in euros as well as operating costs associated with such agreements 
approximately of the company s revenues for the year ended march  were generated from the euro denominated aucs agreements 
the revenues and the related costs resulted in a net euro exposure of the gross profit  which was equal to approximately of revenues 
the euro denominated gross profit offset by other euro denominated operating costs generally resulted in a natural hedge 
however  the timing of settlement of euro denominated accounts receivables and payables subjected us to exchange rate risk on settlement of the receivables and payables 
euro denominated cash and accounts receivable less accounts payable related to aucs agreements was a million net asset as of march  with the termination of the outsourcing services and assignment agreements with aucs  the euro denominated gross profit no longer serves as a natural hedge against other euro denominated operating costs 
if the euro had experienced a hypothetical ten percent weakening or strengthening against the us dollar  our operating expenses would have decreased or increased  respectively  by million during the year ended march  as of march   we were primarily exposed to the following currencies the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
based upon a hypothetical ten percent weakening or strengthening of the us dollar across all currencies  the potential gains or losses in future earnings due to foreign currency exposures would have been approximately million as of that date 
our exposure is substantially unchanged since march  interest rate risk we currently maintain an investment portfolio of investment grade marketable securities 
according to our investment policy  we may invest in taxable instruments including us treasury bills  obligations issued by government agencies  certificates of deposit  commercial paper  master notes  corporate notes and asset backed securities 
in addition  the policy establishes limits on credit quality  maturity  issuer and type of instrument 
all securities are classified as available for sale  and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
fluctuations in fair value attributable to changes in interest rates are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our investment portfolio 
as of march  we had no material long term debt exposure 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of march  are as follows carrying amount maturity thereafter fair value investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term investments weighted average interest rate the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated fair value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of march  are as follows carrying amount maturity thereafter fair value investments cash equivalents weighted average interest rate short term investments weighted average interest rate long term debt secured bank notes average interest rate mortgage loan average interest rate under the terms of our senior secured credit facility entered into on august   we were required to enter into hedge agreements to provide that at least of the outstanding term loans would be subject to fixed interest rates 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rates and mitigate our interest rate risk on the outstanding term loans 
in conjunction with the repayment of our indebtedness under the senior secured credit facility  these interest rate swap agreements were terminated during the year ended march  in connection with the mortgage loan related to the purchase of our headquarters facility  we entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate over the remaining life of the mortgage agreement and mitigate interest rate risk 
in conjunction with the repayment of our mortgage loan  this interest rate swap agreement was terminated during the year ended march commercial contracts with related parties some of our country representatives are related parties where either we hold more than twenty but less than fifty percent ownership interest or a country representative is owned  directly or indirectly  by one of our stockholders 
in each such case  our agreement with the related party acting as our country representative is our standard services agreement 
additionally  we have alternate sales channel agreements with some of our stockholders that allow these stockholders to resell our services under their brand names or to package them with other services they provide to their clients 
these alternate sales channel agreements are generally under the same terms as alternate sales channel agreements we enter into with other communications providers 
finally  from time to time we lease transmission capacity from some of our stockholders where they are existing local carriers 
these leases are generally short term and at tariff rates in regulated markets and at standard market rates in unregulated markets
