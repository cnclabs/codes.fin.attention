item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
sun transaction during our fiscal year ended september  we experienced significant declines in sales  gross profit  profitability and liquidity due primarily to economic and competitive conditions in the united states and the united kingdom 
as a result of quarterly net losses  we were unable to comply with the financial covenants under our million credit facility with a bank syndicate group for the quarters ended december   march  and june   but were able to obtain credit facility amendments and forbearance agreements that deferred through july  the lenders ability to exercise their rights and remedies including the demand for immediate repayment for the event of default under the credit facility resulting from the failures to meet the financial covenants 
on july   we obtained million in additional funding as a result of closing a transaction the sun transaction with sun catalina holdings llc sch  an affiliate of sun capital partners  inc a private investment firm based in boca raton  florida and other parties 
see liquidity and capital resources 
the sun transaction constituted a change of ownership of the company as defined under internal revenue code section irc 
in general  irc can limit an entity s utilization of its net operating loss carry forwards and other anticipated tax return deductions existing at the time the change in ownership occurs 
based upon management s estimate of the impact of irc on the company arising from the sun transaction  during the fourth quarter of we recorded a provision for a valuation allowance of approximately million on deferred tax assets that existed as of july results of operations in the following comparison of the results of operations  our fiscal years ended september   and are referred to herein as  and  respectively 
unless otherwise noted  us dollar equivalents of foreign currency amounts are based upon the exchange rates prevailing at september  comparison of fiscal years ended september  and consolidated results we had operating income of million in compared to operating income of million in the operating income reflects a  charge related to the impairment of land use rights 
the operating income included a  charge related to the settlement of a patent lawsuit 
net income in was million  or 
per diluted share  compared to  or 
per diluted share  in net sales for were million compared to million for lower sales in the united states were partially offset by increased sales in the united kingdom 
lower sales in the united states are primarily a result of decreased volume principally as a result of competitive pressures and general economic environment 
increased sales in the united kingdom are primarily attributable to an increase in the average value of the great british pound gbp relative to the us dollar from during to during  which resulted in higher sales as a result of translation  as well as growth in our uk segment s automotive division 
lamps  lighting fixtures  automotive after market products and industrial consumables accounted for   and of net sales in compared to   and in sales made from warehouses constituted and of our consolidated net sales in and  respectively 
in and  ring s largest customer  b q  a subsidiary of kingfisher plc  accounted for million and million  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
in and  home depot accounted for million and million  respectively  of our consolidated net sales 
we have been advised by home depot that they have shifted purchases of all core program items to alternate suppliers 
we anticipate that our sales to home depot for fiscal year will be significantly less than our sales for fiscal year shipments to kmart during were million below the prior year 
kmart filed a chapter bankruptcy petition with the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois on january   and as a result of downsizing and restructuring  reduced its level of purchases 
gross profit in total dollars decreased from million in to million in  and gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in to in the increase in the gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to i changes in ring s customer and product mix as we emphasized more profitable product lines and ii the strengthening of the gbp relative to the us dollar effectively decreasing ring s cost of products sold and increasing the amount of ring s translated gross profit 
a million increase in the provision for north america slow moving inventory and lost margins on the million decrease in sales reduced our profitability in in december  our us operating company completed its move into a smaller distribution facility 
the increase in the provision for slow moving inventory is a result of our plans to market such inventory at prices less than we previously estimated 
future downward changes in estimated selling prices could reduce our profitability as we increase our provision for slow moving inventory 
our annual ocean freight contract for north america expired on april  based on the current market environment  we may incur an annualized general rate increase of approximately  beginning october   we estimate that the uk segment will incur an annualized rate increase of approximately million 
given the volatile and competitive nature of the ocean freight market  actual rates could significantly vary either favorably or unfavorably from our current estimates 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for were million  a decrease of million from the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in sg a is a result in part of our company wide efforts to reduce operating and overhead costs 
expense categories in which we experienced significant declines included a  decrease in the provision for preferential payment claims  a  decrease in depreciation expense as a result of fewer depreciable assets  a million decrease in payroll and benefits  a  decrease in royalties due to the termination of our license agreement with westinghouse electric corporation effective september   and a  decrease in professional fees 
in addition  the application of the non amortization provisions for goodwill of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas resulted in a million decrease in goodwill amortization for however  insurance expense and our provision for the deductible on our product liability insurance had a combined increase of  and the increase in the value of the gbp relative to the us dollar resulted in a million aggregate increase in sg a of ring as a result of translation 
during we incurred severance costs of  compared to  in the costs incurred in relate to the termination of employees primarily in the united states and china as a result of our continuing efforts to restructure the business 
the costs incurred in related to the termination of employees also primarily in the united states and china 
during the three months ended september   we recorded a charge of  related to the impairment of land use rights as a result of our decision not to construct non production related buildings at our chinese manufacturing facility 
see capital expenditures for further discussion 
litigation settlement of  in reflects the final judgment against us in a patent infringement lawsuit 
on september   we filed a complaint entitled catalina lighting  inc v 
lamps plus  civil action  in the us district court for the southern district of florida 
in the complaint  we requested declaratory relief regarding claims of trade dress and patent infringement made by lamps plus against a major customer of the company 
lamps plus filed an answer and counterclaim against our customer and us on october   alleging patent infringement and trade dress 
the trade dress claim was dismissed with prejudice before trial in march in april  a jury returned a verdict finding liability against us on the patent infringement claim  and in june the court entered a judgment of approximately million for damages and interest thereon 
we appealed the judgment entered by the court and posted a surety bond in the amount of million for the appeal for which we posted million in cash collateral 
in a decision published on june   the court of appeals affirmed the finding of liability against us but reduced the lower court s award of damages 
we received the cash collateral for the surety bond net of the judgment amount 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decreased expense is attributable to lower average outstanding borrowings and a lower weighted average interest rate 
average outstanding borrowings decreased from primarily as a result of the sale of the tupelo  mississippi warehouse in may  the conversion in june of approximately million of subordinated debt to equity  and our use of the cash we generated from operations primarily to pay down debt 
the weighted average effective interest rate decreased primarily because of lower interest rates on the term and revolving credit facilities as a result of lower debt levels and related lower leverage ratio 
as a result of refinancing our million credit facility in december  we anticipate the weighted average interest rate will increase as a result of i a 
increase in the margin over base rate  ii the use of a different and currently higher base rate and iii a million term loan at a fixed rate of 
in may  we sold our mississippi warehouse and substantially all of the equipment to a third party resulting in a loss on sale of million 
the net proceeds from the sale after the pay off of the mortgage bonds of approximately million were used to pay down our term loans 
in addition  we sold two other facilities located in the united kingdom  which resulted in a net gain on sale of  the net loss of  related to the sale of the three facilities was recognized as a loss on disposal of property and equipment 
the net foreign currency gain of  in included foreign currency gains losses for our canadian  mexican and china operations of   and  respectively 
the foreign currency gain of  for our canadian operations reflects an appreciation of the canadian dollar against the us dollar from canadian dollar to us dollar at september  to at september  the net foreign currency loss of  in included foreign currency losses of   and  for our canadian  mexican and china operations  respectively 
other expense was  and  in and  respectively 
the components of other expense in are dividends on ring preferred stock  partially offset by other miscellaneous income 
the components of other expense in consisted primarily of equity in loss of unconsolidated joint venture  and dividends on ring preferred stock  partially offset by interest income  the net proceeds from the settlement of an insurance claim  and other miscellaneous income 
the two joint ventures in which we were involved were dissolved as of september  the effective income tax rates for and were and  respectively 
through september   we have not provided for possible us income taxes on million in undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that were considered to be permanently reinvested 
during the year ended september   we repatriated million in earnings from our hong kong subsidiary go gro  and we intend to repatriate a portion of the future earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries to the united states 
our effective income tax rate can increase when earnings are repatriated 
our effective income tax rate is dependent on both the total amount of pretax income generated  the source of such income ie  domestic or foreign  and the amount and source of earnings repatriated 
consequently  our effective tax rate may vary in future periods 
results by segment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for the financial tables for each business segment 
north america north america had a segment loss in of million compared to a segment loss of  in the increase in segment loss in is primarily attributable to a decrease in gross profit as a result of lower sales  partially offset by a decrease in sg a 
the segment loss included a  charge related to the settlement of a patent lawsuit see consolidated results and a million loss related to the sale of the tupelo  mississippi distribution center in may sales by north america to external customers were million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in sales is primarily a result of decreased volume in the united states as a result of competitive pressures and general economic environment 
in and  home depot accounted for million and million  respectively  of our north america net sales 
we have been advised by home depot that they have shifted purchases of all core program items to alternate suppliers 
we anticipate that our sales to home depot for fiscal year will be significantly less than our current sales for fiscal year shipments to kmart during were million below the prior year 
kmart filed a chapter bankruptcy petition with the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois on january   and as a result of downsizing and restructuring  reduced its level of purchases 
gross profit for north america was million in compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in the million decrease in gross profit and the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales between and are primarily attributable to the million decrease in sales and a million increase in the provision for north america slow moving inventory 
in we recorded estimated inventory provisions of million compared to million in gross inventory of finished products was million at september  compared to million at september  inventory provisions have been made based on management s evaluation of the amount of stock on hand relative to sales during the year  the age of the stock based on purchase date  the historical amount received when slow moving goods are sold and other factors 
the process of evaluating the adequacy of our inventory allowance is subject to significant estimation 
the increase in the provision for slow moving inventory is a result of our plans to market such inventory at prices less than what we previously estimated 
future downward changes in estimated selling prices could reduce our profitability as we increase our provision for slow moving inventory 
presently  most major us customers purchase from our us operating subsidiary  catalina industries  primarily on a direct basis  whereby the merchandise is shipped directly from the factory to the customer  rather than from the warehouse 
customers of catalina canada purchased on a direct basis and from the warehouse in substantially all of mexico s sales are from the warehouse 
direct ship customers receive their goods directly from our factory in china or from other far east suppliers 
as more us customers have changed their sourcing method  warehouse sales to us customers have declined each fiscal year in the eight year period commencing fiscal  when catalina industries former warehouse was constructed in tupelo  mississippi  and warehouse sales were of annual us sales compared to for sg a decreased from million in to million in expense categories where we had significant decreases include the provision for preferential payment claims  payroll  benefits and severance costs million  royalties  primarily due to the termination of our license agreement with westinghouse electric corporation effective september   merchandising costs  depreciation and amortization expense  professional fees  and the non amortization of goodwill as a result of the implementation of sfas during 
however  insurance expense and the provision for the deductible on product liability insurance increased by  in the aggregate 
in may we sold our mississippi warehouse and substantially all of the equipment to a third party  resulting in a loss on sale of million 
this loss was recognized as a loss on disposal of property and equipment for the north american segment in during the quarter ended september   we recorded a charge of  related to the impairment of land use rights as a result of our decision not to construct non production related buildings at our chinese manufacturing facility   of this  charge was allocated to the north america segment 
the segment loss for was reduced by a net foreign currency gain of  compared to a net foreign currency loss of  in the  change is primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
we intend to cease warehousing and distribution activities in mexico effective december  we intend to contact our major mexican customers during the second quarter of fiscal and attempt to convert them to direct import customers of go gro 
we are currently not able to estimate what charge  if any  will be recorded as a result of this decision 
we are currently negotiating with a customer to significantly expand our retail presence in their stores 
in connection with this expanded relationship  we expect to pay the customer during the second and third quarters of as much as million for product displays  store reset costs and markdown reimbursement 
this payment will be recorded as a period cost when disbursed and will reduce our margins in the short term 
united kingdom ring s segment contribution for was million compared to million in exchange rate fluctuations can have a significant translation and economic impact on ring s results 
ring purchases a significant portion of its products in us dollars 
because ring sells primarily in gbp  a decrease in the gbp relative to the us dollar can result in a decrease in ring s margin due to ring s inability in the uk marketplace to increase prices sufficiently to offset the higher effective cost of purchasing goods from china 
conversely  an increase in the gbp relative to the us dollar results in a lower cost of product and higher margin and subjects ring to pricing pressures as customers seek to gain the benefit of the currency movement 
we engage in hedging activities to minimize the effect of changes in exchange rates as discussed in item a of this form k 
in  the gbp increased in value relative to the us dollar 
the average exchange rate for was us dollar per gbp compared to an average of for sales in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
million of the million increase in sales relates to the change in the average exchange rate that is used to translate ring s results in gbp to us dollars between and in gbp  ring s sales increased which was primarily attributable to growth in the automotive division 
the growth in sales has resulted from a combination of new product offerings  increased business with existing customers in its core markets and the supply of new and existing products  such as led torches  power packs  and inverters to new customers 
ring s gross profit for was million compared to million in  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in to in the million increase in gross profit is attributable to changes in ring s customer and product mix approximately million  the strengthening of the gbp relative to the us dollar which decreased ring s cost of products sold approximately million  the favorable impact of the strengthening gbp when translating ring s gross profit to us currency million and increased sales million 
ring continues to benefit from new products introduced in recent years  such as spotlights  torches  inverters and household bulbs  generally with higher than average margins 
the strategy of ring has been to concentrate on the higher margin products and this has resulted in a decline in the sales of lower margin products 
however  some of these lower margin products are being supplied through direct importation from go gro 
sg a increased from million in to million in an increase in payroll and payroll related costs of  an increase of  in insurance  a  increase in the provision for bad debt combined with a million increase as a result of the strengthening of the gbp when translating ring s sg a to the us dollar more than offset the million decrease in sg a from the non amortization of goodwill as a result of the implementation of sfas during interest expense decreased from million in to million in this decrease was attributable to a lower weighted average interest rate and lower average outstanding borrowings

the after tax effect of these items was   and  respectively  or  
and 
per diluted share  respectively 
without these items we would have earned million  or 
per diluted share  in net sales for were million  a million decrease from the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in net sales is primarily attributable to lower sales in the united states and continental europe  partially offset by an increase in sales in the united kingdom 
shipments to kmart during were million below the same period in the prior year

we expensed million in the fourth quarter of in connection with the sun transaction and related resolution of obligations under employment agreements with those individuals serving as our chief executive officer  two former executive vice presidents  and chief financial officer at the time of the sun transaction 
litigation settlement of  in reflected the final judgment against us in a patent infringement lawsuit 
on september   we filed a complaint entitled catalina lighting  inc v 
lamps plus  civil action  in the us district court for the southern district of florida 
in the complaint  we requested declaratory relief regarding claims of trade dress and patent infringement made by lamps plus against a major customer of the company 
lamps plus filed an answer and counterclaim against our customer and us on october   alleging patent infringement and trade dress 
the trade dress claim was dismissed with prejudice before trial in march in april  a jury returned a verdict finding liability against us on the patent infringement claim  and in june the court entered a judgment of approximately million for damages and interest thereon

we received the cash collateral for the surety bond net of the judgment amount 
litigation settlement in related to the favorable settlement of litigation in the united kingdom 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decreased expense is primarily attributable to lower average outstanding borrowings as well as a decrease in variable interest rates partially offset by a higher weighted average interest rate 
average outstanding borrowings decreased primarily as a result of the sale of the tupelo warehouse in may and because the cash we generated during the year from operations was used primarily to pay down debt 
offsetting these items were higher levels of average outstanding subordinated debt issued in connection with the sun transaction 
the weighted average effective interest rate increased primarily because of the high effective rate associated with the subordinated debt as a result of the amortization of discount and issuance costs 
in june  we converted approximately million of subordinated debt to equity 
in may  we sold our mississippi warehouse and substantially all of the equipment to a third party  resulting in a loss on sale of million 
the net proceeds from the sale  after the pay off of the mortgage bonds  of approximately million were used to pay down the company s term loans 
in addition  we sold two other facilities located in the united kingdom  which resulted in a net gain on sale of  the net loss of  related to the sale of the three facilities was recognized as a loss on disposal of property and equipment

north america north america had a segment profit in of million before a million loss on disposal of a warehouse and related equipment and a  charge for settlement of litigation  segment loss after these non recurring items as compared to a segment loss of million in the increase in segment contribution in is primarily attributable to an improvement in gross profit and decreased sg a 
sales by north america to external customers were million in  a decrease of million from the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to weakness in the economy and competitive pressures 
on january   kmart corporation filed a chapter bankruptcy petition with the us bankruptcy court for the northern district of illinois 
our sales to kmart amounted to million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
in and  home depot accounted for million and million  respectively  of our north america net sales 
gross profit for north america was million in compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased from in to in the million increase in gross profit between and is primarily attributable to a million decrease in inventory provisions and a million decrease in warehouse and product development costs  additionally  million of the gross profit increase primarily resulted from changes in our customer and product mix  offset by a decrease of million as a result of the million decrease in sales between and in we recorded estimated inventory provisions of million compared to million in gross inventory of finished products was million at september  compared to million at september  inventory provisions have been made based on management s evaluation of the amount of stock on hand relative to sales during the year  the age of the stock based on purchase date  the historical amount received when slow moving goods are sold and other factors 
the process of evaluating the adequacy of our inventory allowance is subject to significant estimation 
any need to further increase our inventory allowance could significantly adversely impact our future gross profits 
sg a decreased from million in to million in expense categories where we had significant decreases include salary and benefits million  provisions for bad debt and preferential payment claims million  merchandising costs  costs associated with the discontinued chile and argentina operations  travel and entertainment  depreciation  legal and professional  and royalties 
salary and benefits decreased as a result of our efforts to reduce employee headcount and make our cost structure commensurate with our revenue 
provisions for bad debt are made based on our evaluation of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we believe our accounts receivable become uncollectible primarily as a result of customers filing for bankruptcy 
during  we had one customer file for bankruptcy where we did not incur any loss  while in the bankruptcy of several of our customers resulted in a charge of million 
other categories of sga with decreases are a result of our ongoing efforts to reduce operating and overhead costs 
united kingdom ring s segment contribution for was million compared to a loss of million is sales in were million compared to million in  an increase of 
in gbp  ring s sales increased 
the remaining increase relates to a change in the average exchange rate that is used to translate ring s results in gbp to us dollars between and during the average exchange rate was for each gbp compared to for each gbp in the increase in ring s sales is primarily attributable to growth in the lighting and automotive divisions 
this growth was precipitated by a combination of new product offerings  increased business with existing customers and the supply of new and existing products into new markets 
during  sales to ring s largest customer fell  partly as a result of some products being transferred to direct supply from go gro included in china manufacturing and distribution and partly as a result of competitive pressures 
this was offset by growth in sales to the other companies within the uk home center sector and an across the board rise in the automotive sector 
ring s gross profit for was million compared to million in an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased from in to in the million increase in gross profit is a result of changes in ring s customer and product mix million  increased sales million  decreased warehouse and operational costs  decreased freight expense  and decreased inventory provisions 
the changes in ring s customer and product mix are attributable to new products launches commencing late in and continuing into which resulted in growth in sales of outdoor lighting and decorative flush fittings while customer product line reviews resulted in additional sales of household bulbs and spotlights  generally with higher than average margins 
customer product line reviews also resulted in a decline in the sales of lower margin fluorescent tube lighting  as well as a shifting of lower margin business such as desk lamps to direct importation by competing companies and go gro 
the decrease in warehouse and operational costs is primarily attributable to the implementation of strict cost controls and downsizing  which were implemented in the fourth quarter of freight decreased in  despite the increased sales 
this was the result of changes in customer and product mix and the full year benefit of changing several carriers in the previous year 
sg a decreased from million in to million in the decrease in sg a is primarily attributable to decreased payroll and payroll related costs 
in addition  ring had a decrease in employee termination costs of  interest expense decreased from million in to million in attributable to a lower weighted average interest rate

china manufacturing and distribution the segment contribution of china manufacturing and distribution was million in compared to million in sales in were million compared to million in intercompany sales to ring were million in compared to million in sales to customers in continental europe  the united kingdom  and asia were million  million  and million in  respectively  and million  million  and million in  respectively 
sales to ring increased between and as we attempted to direct more of ring s purchases to our wholly owned factory 
increasing the factory s volume reduces fixed factory overhead as a percentage of total manufacturing cost resulting in a lower cost of product for ring as well as north america 
sales to continental europe decreased in as one major customer shifted purchases to alternative suppliers 
gross profit was million in compared to million in gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in compared to in  primarily as a result of changes in our customer and product mix 
sg a was million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to decreased payroll and related costs and travel and entertainment costs 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to our financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity collectibility of accounts receivable our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of our customers  current economic conditions and historical information  and  in the opinion of management  is set in an amount sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
management sets reserves for customers based upon historical collection experience and sets specific reserves for customers whose accounts have aged significantly beyond historical collection experience 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major credit customer default on its obligations to the company  this allowance may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon our operations 
reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value of inventory items declines below cost 
reserves are recorded as a component of cost of sales 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value 
we establish reserves based on historical experience and specific reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of an inventory item falls below its original cost 
income taxes significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets  and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of our valuation allowance  if necessary 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in those jurisdictions 
because of the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
we regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
goodwill in  we began to perform an annual test for impairment of goodwill 
this test is performed by comparing  at the reporting unit level  the carrying value of goodwill to its fair value 
we assess fair value based upon a combination of valuation methodologies applied to each reporting unit 
the tests performed for did not identify any instances of impairment 
however  changes in expectations as to the fair values of the reporting units might impact subsequent years assessments of impairment 
accrual for sales incentives our accrual for sales incentives is usually based on certain stated percentages of gross sales  and is recognized as a reduction of gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded 
if the customer does not provide for the deduction of the allowance amount directly from the amount invoiced the customer at time of billing  we record an accrual for the amounts due 
management sets specific reserves for customers based on contracted amounts and other reserves for the non contractual amounts 
should we underestimate the reserve for the non contractual allowances  this reserve may need to be significantly increased  which would have a negative impact upon our operations 
reserves for product liability claims and litigation we are subject to various legal proceedings  product liability claims and other claims in the ordinary course of our business 
management estimates the amount of ultimate liability  if any  with respect to such matters in excess of applicable insurance coverage based on historical claims experience and current claim amounts  as well as other available facts and circumstances 
as the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict and significant estimates are made with regard to future events  significant changes from estimated amounts could occur 
liquidity and capital resources we meet our short term liquidity needs through cash provided by operations  borrowings under various credit facilities with banks  accounts payable and the use of letters of credit from customers to fund certain of our direct import sales activities 
term loans  lease obligations  mortgage notes  bonds  subordinated debt and capital stock are sources for our longer term liquidity and financing needs 
based upon management s projections and assessment of current market conditions  we believe we will have adequate liquidity to meet our needs for fiscal cash flows and financial condition during  we used funds generated from operations of million and cash on hand to pay down debt of million and make net capital investments of million 
availability under our revolving credit facilities increased from million at september  to million at september  accounts receivable balances decreased to million at september  from million at september  primarily as a result of lower sales in august and september compared to august and september inventory levels at september  were million  as compared to million at september  our agreements with our major customers provide for various sales allowances ie  deductions given the customer from purchases made from us  the most common of which are for volume discounts  consumer product returns and cooperative advertising 
these allowances are usually defined as a percentage of the gross sales price and are recognized as a reduction of gross sales revenue at the time the related sales are recorded 
if the customer agreement does not provide for the deduction of the allowance amount directly from the amount invoiced the customer at time of billing  we record an accrual for the amounts due

in connection with the transaction  a special committee of independent members of the board of directors obtained a fairness opinion from a major investment bank regarding the per share sale price 
other obligations we financed the purchase of our corporate headquarters in miami  florida with a loan payable monthly through  based on a year amortization schedule  with a balloon payment in march the loan bears interest at and is secured by a mortgage on the land and building 
the unpaid balance of this loan was  at september  immediately prior to the closing of the sun transaction  we had existing employment agreements with our then chief executive officer  two executive vice presidents and our then chief financial officer that provided for certain payments to these employees in the event that we experienced a change in control 
we resolved these obligations as part of the sun transaction by terminating the previous employment agreements and entering into settlement agreements with these employees which provide in the aggregate for i the granting of rights to fully vested options to purchase  shares of common stock at a price of per share and ii payments of approximately  each quarter over a three year period beginning september  the quarterly payments under these settlement agreements are suspended at any time in which a default under our credit facility has occurred and is continuing

at september   the remaining amounts due from these individuals totaled  capital expenditures we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures for the fiscal year ending september  in september  go gro deposited the purchase price of approximately million for its joint venture partner s interest in go gro s chinese cooperative joint venture manufacturing subsidiary sje 
this purchase was finalized in december during the quarter ended march   sje was converted under chinese law from a cooperative joint venture to a wholly owned foreign entity and its name was changed to jiadianbao electrical products shenzhen co  ltd 
jes 
jes obtained non transferable land use rights for the land on which its primary manufacturing facilities were constructed under a land use agreement dated april  between sje and the bureau of national land planning bao an branch of shenzhen city 
this agreement provides jes with the right to use this land until january  and required sje to construct approximately  square feet of factory buildings and  square feet of dormitories and offices 
this construction is complete and total costs aggregated million 
in connection with the settlement with go gro s former joint venture partner in sje  jes acquired the land use rights for a parcel of land adjoining its primary manufacturing facilities 
under the separate land use agreement for this parcel  jes has the right to use the land through march  and was obligated to complete new construction on the land estimated to cost approximately million by march  the construction was not completed by that date 
the local municipal planning and state land bureau may take back the land use rights for the parcel without compensation and confiscate the structures and attachments if the construction is not completed by march the company will not begin construction by the march deadline and during the fourth quarter of decided not to seek an extension from local authorities 
as a result of this decision  the company recorded a  provision for impairment of land use rights during the fourth quarter of there are no structures on this parcel  and should the local authorities confiscate the land  we do not believe there would be any impact on the operations of the factory 
litigation during the past few years  we have received a number of claims relating to halogen torchieres sold by us to various retailers 
the number of such claims has decreased significantly since the applicable underwriters laboratories inc ul standard was changed and the halogen torchieres produced complied with such new standard 
through january   we maintained primary product liability insurance coverage of million per occurrence  million in the aggregate  as well as umbrella insurance policies providing an aggregate of million in insurance coverage 
the primary insurance policy required us to self insure for up to  per incident 
effective january   the umbrella coverage was decreased to million and the deductible was increased to  per incident involving halogen light products and  for all other incidents 
all other significant aspects of the policy remain unchanged 
based on experience  we have accrued  for this contingency as of september  no assurance can be given that the number of claims will not exceed historical experience or that claims will not exceed available insurance coverage or that we will be able to maintain the same level of insurance 
other matters our ability to import products from china at current tariff levels could be materially and adversely affected if the ntr status the us government has granted to china for trade and tariff purposes is terminated 
as a result of its ntr status  china receives the same favorable tariff treatment that the united states extends to its other normal trading partners 
china s ntr status  coupled with its membership in the wto  could eventually reduce barriers to manufacturing products in and exporting products from china 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that china s wto membership or ntr status will not change 
ring has a defined benefit pension plan which covered current employees and approximately members formerly associated with ring 
on april   the current employees joined a defined contribution pension plan and stopped accruing future benefits under the defined benefit plan and there are now no active members in the defined benefit plan 
the defined benefit plan is administered externally and the assets are held separately by professional investment managers 
the plan is funded by contributions at rates recommended by an actuary based on the minimum funding requirement mfr 
the uk government has announced that it intends to abolish the mfr and to replace it with funding standards individually tailored to the circumstances of plans and employers 
in june  the uk government announced that i solvent employers who choose to terminate their defined benefit pension plans are expected to meet the full buyout costs of all members benefits and ii a pension protection fund is to be introduced to guarantee members a specified minimum level of pension when the employer becomes insolvent 
all employers with defined benefit pension plans will pay a flat rate levy and those plans which are underfunded  such as the ring plan  will have to pay a higher premium to the protection fund 
the amount of the levy has not been determined by the protection fund 
the full buyout cost is considerably higher than the mfr cost 
we do not intend to terminate the plan in the foreseeable future 
in conjunction with the changes announced by the uk government in june  the company recorded a net equity charge of million to other comprehensive income pretax charge of million net of income taxes of million to increase the accrued pension cost recorded in the september  balance sheet to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation as of such date of million 
as a result of the change in uk law  at some time in the future  the company must negotiate with the plan trustees the amount of cash funded into the plan 
the company has not begun these negotiations but expects that future funding will increase 
the weighted average assumptions used in the actuarial computations related to the defined benefit pension plan are consistent and reasonable

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk approximately of our debt at september  at september  was subject to variable interest rates 
the remainder of our debt has fixed interest rates 
our fixed interest rate debt primarily represents million face value in subordinated notes 
the carrying value and market value of our debt at september  were million and million  respectively 
based upon debt balances outstanding at september   a basis point ie  addition to our weighted average effective interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately  on an annual basis 
as of december   the date of our new credit facility  approximately of our debt was subject to variable interest rates 
foreign currency risk we maintain significant investments in subsidiaries in the united kingdom and canada  and sell our products into these foreign markets 
we also maintain a major capital investment in manufacturing facilities and supporting administrative offices in china 
due to the significance of our international sales and operations  our business and operating results are impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
if any of the currencies of the foreign countries in which we conduct business depreciated against the us dollar we could experience significant changes in our competitive position  cost structure and the translations of assets  liabilities and transactions denominated in foreign currencies  which could adversely impact our future earnings 
we engage in certain hedging activities with respect to foreign currency exposures 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities 
our foreign net asset exposures defined as assets denominated in foreign currency less liabilities denominated in foreign currency at fiscal year ends in us dollar equivalents were as follows in thousands great british pounds gbp hong kong dollars canadian dollars our foreign currency risks relative to our significant foreign subsidiaries are as follows ring mainly sells in gbp but pays in us dollars for approximately of the products it purchases 
ring hedges against movements in gbp relative to the us dollar by purchasing forward foreign currency contracts to cover of the estimated us dollar denominated purchases on a rolling six months basis 
in addition  upon a foreign currency liability becoming known for products that have been shipped which would not be covered by these contracts  individual foreign exchange contracts are entered into to exchange gbp for the relevant foreign currency on the date on which the liability falls due 
this policy effectively hedges approximately of ring s us dollar requirement for two months and going forward three to six months 
at september  and  ring had outstanding forward contracts to exchange gbp for us dollars for gbp million and gbp million  respectively 
the forward contracts outstanding at september  mature through february   and the contracts outstanding at september  matured through march  the short term of ring s foreign exchange contracts hedging specific purchases  and the fact that only of expected purchases going forward three to six months are hedged  limit their effectiveness as a hedge against a significant depreciation of the gbp against the us dollar over the course of a relatively longer period  such as a year 
consequently  as was the case in  a depreciation of the gbp against the dollar could adversely impact ring s gross margins to the extent the increase in the effective cost of goods purchased in us dollars could not be passed on to ring s uk customers through higher sales prices 
as ring s assets  liabilities and transactions are recorded in gbp  ring s results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into us dollars for our financial reporting purposes 
a decline in the gbp relative to the us dollar over the course of ie  including the actual exchange experience would have reduced ring s translated net sales by million  reduced ring s translated segment income from million to million but would have resulted in an increase of  million in the foreign currency translation gain 
these adjusted amounts do not reflect any economic impacts of the devaluation of the gbp on ring s sales  margins  results and overall business 
more than of go gro s sales in approximately of which were intercompany were made in us dollars 
go gro purchases in us dollars  hong kong dollars hk dollars and chinese renminbi 
a greater portion of go gro s sales are in us dollars than its cost of sales and other operating costs  therefore an appreciation of the hk dollar or the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar could  in the short term  decrease go gro s operating margins and profits assuming its sales prices in us dollars remain firm 
as go gro s assets  liabilities and transactions are recorded in hk dollars and chinese renminbi  go gro s results and financial condition are subject to translation adjustments upon their conversion into us dollars for our financial reporting purposes 
a appreciation of the hk dollar and chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar over the course of us  in addition to actual experience would not have significantly impacted go gro s translated sales for  but would have decreased their translated segment contribution for by  and resulted in a decrease in its translation loss of million for these adjusted amounts do not reflect any economic impacts of the hk dollar on go gro s sales  gross profits  results and overall business 
catalina canada sells in both us dollars approximately of sales and cdn dollars approximately of sales 
most of catalina canada s goods are purchased from go gro in us dollars 
similar to ring  a decrease in the cdn dollar relative to the us dollar could adversely impact catalina canada s margins and profitability if the higher effective cost of its products could not be passed on to catalina canada s customers through higher sales prices 
an assumed depreciation of the cdn dollar relative to the us dollar over the course of ie  in addition to actual exchange experience would have resulted in a translation reduction of our net sales of  for and a  decrease in consolidated net income 
these adjusted amounts do not reflect any economic impacts of the devaluation of the cdn dollars on catalina canada s sales  margins  results  and overall business
