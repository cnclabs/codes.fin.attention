while we have expended our capital to make acquisitions and to create an infrastructure to support our business  we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitable operations 
our working capital requirements may increase and future required funding may not be available we operate our business using working capital derived from our operations during periods when our operations are cash flow positive and from funds available from our lines of credit 
we have made efforts to improve our cash flow through cost reductions  collections of accounts receivable and reductions in our inventory 
we have also raised working capital through private placements of our securities 
we believe that our internally generated cash flow from operations combined with the proceeds of our recently completed private placement and borrowings available under our lines of credit will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the next twelve months  provided our efforts to increase our working capital and to obtain a replacement us line of credit are successful 
we may also sell additional debt or equity securities in order to meet our current and future working capital requirements or to fund future acquisitions  including shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants to be issued in the warrant dividend 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or reduce our expenses  and we are unable to obtain the working capital required for our business  our financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
our us credit agreement imposes restrictions and we are not in compliance with some of the restrictions  our us line of credit could be called if waivers of financial covenants and defaults are not obtained we have a million revolving line of credit with a us financial institution secured by our us assets 
the agreement governing the line of credit contains covenants that impose limitations on us including the requirement that any acquisition which we make be approved by the financial institution  limits our borrowings based upon a borrowing base formula tied to the value of our accounts receivable and inventory from time to time  and requires us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants 
if we fail to make required payments  or if we fail to comply with the various covenants contained in our credit agreement  the lender may be able to accelerate the maturity of such indebtedness 
our revolving line of credit  as extended  currently expires on july  as part of the most recent extension agreement signed in january  the interest rate charged on the outstanding balance was raised to prime for the period from january  to april  and to prime for the period thereafter until maturity 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants regarding tangible net worth and leverage contained in our credit agreement 
a waiver has been granted by the financial institution with respect to the year ended december  we also anticipate that we may violate the financial covenants in our credit agreement during future periods  including as of the end of the quarter ended march   and we will need waivers for such financial covenant violations unless our results of operations substantially improve 
while there can be no assurance  we anticipate that our lender will continue to waive such covenant violations 
if our lender does not waive such covenant violations and seeks to foreclose on the assets securing our line of credit  it would have a material and adverse effect on our business our lender has advised us that it does not presently intend to renew our line of credit our lender has advised us that at this time it is unlikely that they will renew our line of credit  although they have indicated that they will continue to extend our line of credit for limited periods of time to allow us to obtain alternative financing from another lender 
while we expect to be able to find alternative financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
in the event that we are unable to find alternative financing to replace our line of credit and our current lender declines to further extend our line of credit  it would have a material and adverse effect on our business 
our operating results may be adversely effected by many factors our quarterly and annual operating results are impacted by many factors  including the timing of orders  the availability of inventory to meet customer requirements and inventory obsolescence 
a large portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed 
since we typically do not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments from our customers  we must anticipate the future volume of orders based upon the historic purchasing patterns of our customers and upon our discussions with our customers as to their future requirements 
cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by a large customer or a group of customers and inventory obsolescence could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations 
impact of fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates could negatively affect our results we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  and as a global company  we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our lines of credit 
if short term interest rates averaged more in and  our interest expense and loss before taxes would have increased by  and  respectively 
for  our interest expense would have increased and our income before taxes would have decreased by  the increase in the interest rate on our us line of credit in will increase our interest expense and decrease our income before taxes by approximately  in  compared to interest expense and income before taxes under the prior interest rate 
our revenues and net worth are also affected by foreign currency exchange rates due to having subsidiaries in norway  sweden  germany  and the czech republic 
while our sales to our subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars  each subsidiary owns assets and conducts business in its local currency 
upon consolidation  our subsidiaries financial results are impacted by the value of the us dollar 
a uniform strengthening as of december   and in the value of the dollar would have resulted in reduced revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
a uniform strengthening as of december   and in the value of the dollar would have resulted in a reduction of our consolidated net worth by   and  respectively 
we find it impractical to hedge foreign currency exposure and  as a result  will continue in the future to experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we will not pay dividends on our common stock even if we are profitable we can make no assurances that our future operations will be profitable 
should our operations be profitable  it is likely that we would retain our earnings in order to finance future growth and expansion 
further  our us line of credit agreement contains restrictions on the payment of dividends  including lender approval 
therefore  we do not presently intend to declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock  and it is not likely that any dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future 
this policy could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 released by the us securities and exchange commission  encourages all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s customers include original equipment manufacturers  distributors and other value added resellers 
sales are generally not made directly to end users of the company s products 
revenues are recognized at the time of shipment to customers  by which time the customer has agreed to purchase the merchandise  is obligated to pay the fixed  reasonably collectible sales price and ownership and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
the company s sales are not subject to rights of future return 
warranties are provided on certain of the company s networking products for periods ranging from five years to lifetime 
warranty claims have historically been nominal 
the company estimates provisions for sales returns  allowances  product warranties and losses on accounts receivable 
the company s credit policy provides for an evaluation of the credit worthiness of new customers and for continuing evaluations of customers financial condition and credit worthiness 
although the company generally does not require collateral  letters of credit or deposits may be required from customers 
the company includes shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues 
costs of sales include outbound freight and preparing customers orders for shipment 
included in net sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december    and are shipping and handling fees of   and  respectively 
use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and the carrying value of inventories and long lived assets 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded net sales of million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
million or approximately 
revenues in include full year intelek sales of million compared to million for the prior year  based on four months of ownership in further  the declining value of the us dollar increased sales in western europe when converted from local currency to us dollars in the amount of approximately million 
without the impact of this acquisition and foreign currency change  revenues would have declined from million in to million in  a decrease of million or approximately 
this drop in net sales for our full year operations reflects the continuing depressed economic conditions in our worldwide markets  which have resulted in pricing pressures and to a lesser degree  unit reductions in volume on certain of our products 
as a result  the company has had to adjust some of its prices downward to meet competitive situations 
gross profit percentages did not decline as well  as the company was able to secure lower pricing from its suppliers 
overall  the company posted net revenue declines in its us  norwegian  swedish and russian markets of    and  respectively  before the effect of foreign currency changes 
the company s us market was affected by an approximately drop in selling prices  but was able to maintain a relatively consistent level in unit sales 
the norwegian market s unit volume was adversely affected by a competitive situation involving former employees who established a competing company 
the swedish and russian markets were affected by both sales price declines and unit volume reductions 
alternatively  the company s german operations recorded a sales increase of  due to the employment in early of a new sales team that expanded the company s customer base and product line in germany 
we expect that the factors which impacted our and net sales will continue to impact our net sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december   decreased to million  compared to cost of sales of million for the year ended december  this decrease of million  when coupled with a smaller drop in net sales  led to a rise in gross profit to million in compared to million in the gross profit percentage rose in to compared in the prior year 
this improvement in gross profit was due to two items  a decline in the amounts set aside for inventory obsolescence and a change in the sales mix to higher margin signamax products in the us the provision for inventory impairment decreased from  in to  in we recorded these impairment provisions based on the sudden and significant decrease in demand which began in for certain of our products caused by the worldwide economic slowdown  specifically in the technology markets for our goods 
this decrease in demand had a more significant effect on our inventory in  thereby requiring a greater inventory impairment charge in  compared to these provisions were calculated based on the carrying value of specific inventory items compared to historical and estimated sales volumes and sales prices 
without the effect of the inventory impairment charges in each year  the gross profit would have been relatively unchanged from year to year at approximately million  while the gross profit percentage would have increased from in to in the remainder of the improvement in gross margin percentage was due to the million decrease in us sales to our russian distributor in  whereby that customer  whose gross margins at run lower than the historic consolidated average  accounted for a smaller percentage of us sales 
essentially  these sales were replaced by sales at a higher margin 
selling  general and administrative s  g a expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the following table reconciles the s  g a expenses for each year by segregating those items that could be considered isolated or non recurring in thousands total s  g a expenses   intelek full year  intelek four months options and stock for services goodwill amortization our czech republic subsidiary  intelek  was purchased in august  therefore only four months of operations are included in based on the table above  operational s  g a expenses were relatively constant from to  decreasing  or less than 
increases in insurance costs and marketing expenses new computer connectivity catalog of approximately  were offset by  in cost reductions in our us workforce and other variable expenses  such as office expenses 
subsequent to the intelek acquisition  in early  the company instituted expense reduction measures at intelek  thereby decreasing s  g a expenses at intelek on an annualized basis from to we are continuing to closely monitor our s  g a expenses and may make additional headcount reductions if sales levels do not begin to increase in future periods 
we believe that if sales increase in the future  we will see a reduction in s  g a expenses as a percentage of net sales  since many of our s  g a expenses are relatively fixed 
amortization of intangible assets was discontinued on january  as we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires  among other things  that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
during the quarter ended june   we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test and at december   we completed our annual goodwill impairment test  determining that we had no impairment of our goodwill at either date 
we will continue to assess the value of our goodwill during future periods in accordance with the rules 
in  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we determined that the carrying value of certain long lived intangible assets associated with certain acquisitions may not be recoverable 
the resulting impairment of  was recorded as an impairment of long lived assets in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  no such impairment charge was required in as a result of the above factors  the loss from operations for the year ended december  was  compared to a loss from operations of  for the year ended december   a reduction in the loss from operations of  interest expense dropped from  in to  in due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance under our us line of credit  as well as a significant decline in the applicable interest rate  which is variable and pegged to the prime rate 
due to a material drop in the value of the us dollar against those foreign currencies where we conduct operations in local currency  namely germany  norway  sweden and the czech republic  we recorded a gain from foreign exchange of  in the year ended december   compared to a loss from foreign exchange of  in  when the us dollar performed relatively well against foreign currencies 
the loss before income taxes narrowed in to  compared to  in  as a result of the factors mentioned above 
the provision for income taxes has been recorded for the past two years on those european subsidiaries that recorded profitable operations  namely jotec and lanse in norway and intelek in the czech republic 
additionally  we recorded a provision of  as a result of a preliminary assessment on an in process tax audit at our german subsidiary 
for  the provision is  and for  the provision is  realization of the net deferred tax assets recorded on the us losses  resulting primarily from net operating loss carryforwards  is not considered more likely than not and accordingly  a valuation allowance has been recorded for the full amount of such assets 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the loss per common share  both basic and diluted  was  compared to a basic and diluted loss per common share of for the year ended december  weighted average shares outstanding were  in and  in year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   we achieved net sales of million  compared to net sales of million for the year ended december  revenues in were positively impacted by million for the full year sales of lanse revenues of million compared to revenues of million for the seven months of ownership in and by million in sales by intelek acquired in august 
without the impact of these acquisitions  net sales would have decreased by million or from this significant drop in sales throughout our worldwide operations for the year ended december  was due to several factors including worsening worldwide economic conditions generally in the technology market and specifically in several of our markets 
for the year ended december   us original equipment manufacturer oem sales totaled million reflecting a reduction of  compared to million for the year ended december  us networking sales were million for  compared to million for international sales were million reflecting an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  however  this increase related to increased sales from lanse and intelek 
without sales from companies acquired  international sales for the year ended december  would have been million or lower from period to period 
our gross profit margin for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  the primary reasons for the gross profit margin decline were the impact of lower margins relating to sales by lanse and intelek which have gross margins lower than our historic margins  provisions for inventory impairment taken in  and the economic slowdown which heightened price competition as a result of reduced demand for the company s products 
we recorded provisions for inventory impairment totaling million in due to the sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products resulting from decreased spending on technology and a generally sluggish economy  as well as our ongoing business transition from pc connectivity products to networking products 
these provisions were estimated based on the carrying value of specific current inventory balances compared to current sales volumes and prices and estimated future sales price analysis prepared by our sales departments for computer connectivity and networking products in each of our geographic areas of operations 
the provision for inventory obsolescence was made for certain specific inventory items in the us of  and in western europe of  had we not recorded the million provision for inventory impairment in  our gross profit margin would have been of net sales 
the remainder of the gross profit percent decline from in to in net of the inventory obsolescence provision  was due to depressed technology market conditions  which pushed market prices lower for many of the company s products 
we were forced to meet the lower prices in order to seek to maintain market share and revenue levels  and this  coupled with an inability to immediately lower our supplier prices to the same degree  drove our gross margins lower from period to period 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in sg a expenses is as a result of cost reductions offset by  in expenses relating to intelek s operations subsequent to its acquisition by us 
we also incurred a  non cash charge in relating to a stock option granted to an investment banking firm for its services and recorded an increase in our provision for losses on accounts receivable of  due to worsening economic conditions 
based on current market conditions and an analysis of projected undiscounted cash flows calculated in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we determined in that the carrying value of certain long lived assets associated with our purchase of focus enhancement s networking division focus  march purchase of ccci  may purchase of lanse as  and august purchase of intelek spol 
sro may not be recoverable 
the resultant impairment necessitated a write down of goodwill of approximately  related to focus   related to ccci   related to lanse as  and  related to intelek spol 
sro the estimated fair value of these long lived assets has been determined by calculating the present value of estimated expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
in the second and third quarters of  we began steps to modify our cost structure and reduce expenditures in order to respond to the economic slowdown affecting our sales 
as a result  worldwide employment dropped at december  by from march  levels 
amortization of intangible assets was  for the year ended december   an increase of  or over amortization of  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to amortization charges arising as a result of our acquisition of lanse in may due to the our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets during the quarter ended march   amortization of goodwill has been effectively eliminated as of january  see recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion of sfas as a result of the aforementioned factors  the loss from operations for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from income from operations of million for the year ended december  interest expense was relatively flat from period to period  in compared to  for 
interest income decreased due primarily to lower interest rates 
income tax expense decreased to  in from  in  as a result of decreased profitability in europe 
since we have us income tax loss carry forwards  and currently maintain a tax valuation allowance of million  we do not expect to pay us income tax in the forseeable future 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million compared to net income of  for the year ended december  the loss per diluted share was for the year ended december   compared to the earnings per diluted share of 
for the year ended december  weighted average shares outstanding were  in  compared to  in on a diluted basis  due principally to shares issued in our june private placement 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have financed our operations primarily with cash flow from operations and with borrowings under our available lines of credit 
below is a chart setting forth our contractual payment obligations as of december  which have been aggregated in order to facilitate a basic understanding of our liquidity in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years lines of credit   long term debt operating leases   total contractual cash obligations    we also have employment agreements with two of our officers who are also our principal shareholders which require annual payments of base compensation  plus  in the event we are profitable  additional bonus compensation 
see item  executive compensation employment agreements 
during  we completed a private placement of shares of our common stock 
we sold  shares in the private placement at a gross purchase price of per share 
the net proceeds of the placement  were used for working capital purposes 
at december   our working capital was million  a decrease of from working capital of million at december  similarly  our current ratio was at december   compared to at december  the accounts with the most significant changes from december  to december  were the following in thousands inventories   inventories declined in the us and in western europe as a result of our efforts to reduce the carrying value of our inventory and therefore the costs invested in our inventory 
further  we recorded a provision for inventory obsolescence of in the us and in western europe in however  the inventory obsolescence charge in western europe was offset by the effect of the declining value of the us dollar  which caused an increase in western european inventory when converted from local currency to the us dollar 
line of credit   line of credit borrowings increased principally due to borrowed in the us as we utilized our line to partially fund our us losses from operations 
accounts payable   in the us  accounts payable decreased as a result of our utilization of a portion of the funds generated from our private placement to make additional payments to our vendors 
accrued expenses the increase in accrued expenses is due primarily to two items  additional accruals in the us for professional and other fees of approximately and an increase in the liability for the value added tax vat in germany of this vat liability is offset by a like asset in accounts receivable due to the goods that are generating the tax being classified as resale items and therefore  the tax generated by the vendor invoice is then offset by the tax due from the customer 
customer deposits and other customer deposits increased principally in the fourth quarter of  when we received additional advance payments from a significant customer of approximately for the year ended december    of cash was used by operations 
the primary reasons for the use of cash in was the net loss of  reduced by non cash items such as depreciation and amortization of  and a provision for inventory obsolescence of  additionally  uses of cash were generated by a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and an increase in accounts receivable of  offset by an inventory reduction of  net cash used in investing activities was  due to additions to property and equipment of  offset by proceeds on the sale of investments of  and collections on a note receivable of  cash of  was provided by financing activities primarily from the private placement  which raised net cash for the company of approximately  as a result of the foregoing  our cash position decreased  between december  and december  that decrease  combined with a increase of  attributable to the effects of exchange rate changes on cash  produced an overall decrease in cash of  we are continuing efforts to improve our cash position through personnel and expense reductions  collection of accounts receivable  and a reduction in our inventory 
in january   we obtained an extension of a million us based line of credit from a financial institution 
borrowings available under the line of credit  which matures on july   bear interest at the rate of prime plus two percent increasing to prime plus three percent in april until maturity 
borrowings under the line of credit are based on specific percentages of our receivables and inventories 
the line of credit is secured by a lien on our us assets  including accounts receivable and inventories 
the line of credit is also guaranteed by our principal shareholders  who have pledged a portion of the shares of our common stock that they own to secure their respective guarantees 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we are required to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants and to maintain certain financial benchmarks and ratios during future periods 
as of december   we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth and leverage covenants 
a waiver has been granted by the financial institution 
additionally  we will likely not meet our financial covenants in future periods unless our results of operations substantially improve 
while there can be no assurance  we expect that our lender will continue to waive covenant violations during future periods 
further  our lender has advised us that at this time it is unlikely that they will renew our line of credit  although they have indicated that they intend to continue to extend our line of credit for limited periods of time to allow us to obtain alternative financing from another lender 
while we expect to be able to find alternative financing  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so 
as of december    was outstanding under the line of credit line and  was available for borrowing based on applicable borrowing base formulas 
as of march    was outstanding under the line of credit and  was available for borrowing based on applicable borrowing base formulas 
we believe that revenue growth requires working capital to support the increased levels of inventory necessary to meet customer demands and to support accounts receivable generated from increased sales 
we further believe that our internally generated cash flow from operations combined with the proceeds of the recent private placement of common stock  combined with borrowings available under our lines of credit  will be sufficient to fund our current operations for the next twelve months  provided our efforts to increase our working capital and to obtain a replacement us line of credit are successful 
as a result of our reducing operations at our ccci facility in pennsylvania during the latter part of  we expect to realize expense savings of approximately  during we may also consider selling debt or equity securities in order to meet our current and future working capital requirements or to fund future acquisitions  including shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants to be issued in the warrant dividend 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or in some other fashion  or reduce our expenses  our operations will be materially and adversely affected 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our financial condition or operating results for the last several years  as we have historically been able to pass along increased costs in the form of adjustments to the prices we charge to our customers 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
that standard requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity will capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier adoption permitted 
we believe that adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
sfas no 
will rescind sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax benefit 
as a result of sfas no 
 the criteria in apb no 
will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
the new requirements are effective commencing may   with early application encouraged 
we believe that adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit including restructuring or disposal activities at fair value when the related liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan under current practice 
costs covered by the standard include certain contract termination costs  certain employee termination benefits and other costs to consolidate or close facilities and relocate employees that are associated with an exit activity or disposal of long lived assets 
the new requirements are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  and will be adopted by us effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future exit and disposal activities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the statement amends the transition provisions of sfas no 
for companies that choose to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the statement does not amend the provisions of sfas no 
which allow for entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method as prescribed in apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  however it does amend some of the disclosure requirements regardless of the method used to account for stock based employee compensation 
see stock based compensation 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation was effective for disclosure purposes as of december  and the recognition provisions are effective for all guarantees issued or modified after december  as of december  we had no material guarantees for disclosure purposes 
interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
interpretation no 
is applicable immediately for variable interest entities created after january  for variable interest entities created prior to january   the provisions of interpretation no 
are applicable no later than july  we do not expect this interpretation to have an effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  and as a global company  we also face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the variable interest rate contained in our credit facility 
if short term interest rates averaged more in the years ended december  and  our interest expense and loss before taxes would have increased by  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   our interest expense would have increased and our income before taxes would have decreased by  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to change 
the increase in the interest rate on our us line of credit in will increase our interest expense and decrease our income before taxes by approximately  in  compared to interest expense and income before taxes under the prior interest rate 
our revenues and net worth are also affected by foreign currency exchange rates due to having subsidiaries in norway  sweden  germany and the czech republic 
while our sales to subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars  each subsidiary owns assets and conducts business in its local currency 
upon consolidation  the subsidiaries financial results are impacted by the value of the us dollar 
a uniform strengthening as of december   and in the value of the dollar would have resulted in reduced revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
a uniform strengthening as of december   and in the value of the dollar would have resulted in a reduction of our consolidated net worth by   and  respectively 
the strengthening of the value of the dollar has a lesser impact at december  versus since we sold our wholly owned ukrainian subsidiary in january and acquired intelek late in august we periodically evaluate the materiality of foreign exchange risk and the financial instruments available to mitigate this exposure 
we attempt to mitigate our foreign exchange exposures by only maintaining assets directly related to the local operations in the exposed currency wherever possible 
we find it impractical to hedge foreign currency exposure and as a result will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in the future
