in thousands of dollars except for per share information 
forward looking statements certain of the matters and subject areas discussed in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of all statements other than statements of historical information provided herein are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements generally include words such as anticipates  expects  believes  intends  estimates  and similar expressions  and include those statements regarding our expectations  intentions and beliefs with regard to the future  including our efforts involving lean manufacturing  erp and crm system implementations  cost reduction efforts  conditions of the electronics industry  general economic conditions  technology or other trends and known uncertainties 
these forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those more fully described under the caption factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this annual report 
these forward looking statements reflect management s analysis  judgment  belief or expectation only as of the date hereof 
we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
general our business is to design  develop  manufacture and market complex electronic instruments and systems geared to the specialized needs of electronics manufacturers for high performance production testing  process monitoring  product development and research 
our primary products are integrated systems used to source  measure  connect  control or communicate electrical dc  rf or optical signals 
our customers are engineers  technicians and scientists in manufacturing  product development and research functions 
during fiscal  approximately percent of total orders were received from the semiconductor industry 
approximately percent came from research and education customers 
approximately percent came from the wireless customer group 
approximately percent came from the electronic components and subassemblies manufacturers customer group  which includes customers in automotive  computer and peripherals  medical equipment  aerospace and defense  and manufacturers of components other than optoelectronic components 
less than percent came from the optoelectronics customer group  with the remainder coming from customers in a variety of other industries 
although our products vary in capability  sophistication  use  size and price  they generally test  measure and analyze electrical  rf  optical or physical properties 
as such  we consider our business to be in a single industry segment 
beginning in the second half of fiscal year  an economic downturn affecting the worldwide electronics industry had a negative impact on many of the industries we serve  including but not limited to the semiconductor industry  the wireless communications industry  the optoelectronics industry  and electronic components and subassemblies manufacturers 
during fiscal  conditions continued to negatively affect our customers and  therefore  our results 
however  conditions throughout the electronics industry appear to have stabilized  and we noted an improved environment in the electronics industry during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 
effective april   we began serving our japanese customers through a direct sales force  the majority of whom are japanese nationals 
prior to april   we sold our products through a japanese distributor  who in turn  sold them to end customers 
the effect on our results of operations of going direct in japan was positive in as the operation was profitable for the fiscal year 
the effect of going direct increased net sales and gross profits as we previously sold our products to the japanese distributor at a discount 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses increased 
effective january   we began to sell our products in the united states through a direct sales force 
prior to january   we sold through sales representatives to whom we paid a commission 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we incurred approximately in one time costs as we paid both commissions to sales representatives and salaries to our own sales employees 
we expect that selling through our own sales force in the united states will be favorable to earnings during times of strong us sales and unfavorable during times of depressed us sales as a greater portion of us selling costs are now fixed 
beginning near the end of fiscal  we began to incur costs in preparation for the transition to new erp enterprise resource planning and crm customer relationship management software systems 
we went live with erp in the united states on may   with minimal disruptions to our business 
we will continue our erp and crm implementations throughout the remainder of fiscal the financial impact of the erp and crm projects was a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately in fiscal and approximately in  including depreciation expense of the software 
included in capital expenditures was  and in fiscal and  respectively  related to the erp and crm systems 
over the last to months  we have made major changes to the way we purchase and manufacture as we have adopted lean manufacturing principles 
while we had seen some of the benefits of lean  our overall manufacturing costs have increased 
during the fourth quarter  we began our next phase of the lean implementation 
this next phase involves fine tuning our processes and improving our execution 
we began to see improvements during the fourth quarter of fiscal in lowering our manufacturing costs and improving our manufacturing effectiveness 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management has identified the company s critical accounting policies 
these policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on our financial statements  either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate  or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring  at a specific point in time  events which will be settled in the future 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the reported financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time the product is shipped under fob shipping terms 
upon shipment  a provision is made for estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties and sales returns 
when other significant obligations remain after products are delivered  revenue is recognized only after such obligations are fulfilled 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on a currently adjusted standard  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we periodically review our recorded inventory and estimate a reserve for obsolete or slow moving items 
such estimates are difficult to make under current economic conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional reserves may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  our cost of sales will be lower than expected in that period 
income taxes keithley is subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involves a significant amount of judgment by management 
judgment is also applied in determining whether the deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for assumptions utilized  including the amount of federal  state and international pretax operating income  the reversal of book versus tax differences  and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business 
as of september   a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets had been established related to foreign tax credits and research and development credits  which may not be realized due to the uncertainty of future profit levels or foreign source income 
we intend to maintain this valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance  until such credits are realized or until such credits expire 
our income tax benefit expense recorded in the future will be reduced to the extent of offsetting decreases in our valuation allowance 
the realization of our remaining deferred tax assets is primarily dependent upon forecasted future taxable income 
any reduction in estimated forecasted future taxable income may require that we record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in various tax jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax issues based upon our estimate of whether additional taxes will be due 
if payments of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to income tax expense would result 
pension plan retirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business that represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
we are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arrive at pension income or expense for the year 
as the rate of return on plan assets assumption is a long term estimate  it can differ materially from the actual return realized on plan assets in any given year  especially when markets are highly volatile 
as of september   the expected long term rate of return in the us was and for the non us plan 
we have analyzed the rates of return on assets used and determined that these rates are reasonable based on the plans historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the plans are effective  as well as the plans asset mix between equities and fixed income investments 
assumed discount rates are used in measurements of the projected  accumulated  and vested benefit obligations and the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost 
we make estimates of discount rates to reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled 
in making those estimates  management evaluates rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
as of september   the estimated discount rate in the us was and for the us plan 
management will continue to assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumptions for 
table of contents both the us plan and us plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by accounting principles generally accepted in the us and will make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
pension income or expense is allocated to cost of goods sold  selling  general and administrative expenses  and product development expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
stock compensation plans we have two active stock option plans and an employee stock purchase plan 
we have chosen the disclosure provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  and as such  no compensation cost for the stock option and stock purchase plans has been recognized in the consolidated financial statements  except in certain cases when stock options were granted below the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
for disclosure purposes  the valuation of stock issued to employees requires management to determine estimates for the expected life of the options  the expected risk free interest rate during the expected life of the option  the expected volatility of the stock price over the expected life of the option  and the expected dividend yield 
these estimations are significant factors in the valuation model and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we currently use the black scholes model to value options 
recently  the financial accounting standard board fasb indicated that it may require all companies to expense stock options 
it plans to issue an exposure draft in early that could become effective in results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and supplementary data included in item of this annual report 
percent of net sales for the years ended september net sales cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expenses product development expenses severance charges net financing income loss income before income taxes income benefit taxes net loss income the net loss for was  or per share 
these results include  or per share  in the income tax provision for the establishment of a tax valuation allowance 
they also include pretax  or per share after taxes  for severance charges 
the net loss for was  or per share 
included in the results were severance charges of  pretax  or per share after taxes 
net income was  or per share on a diluted basis  in net sales were  in compared with  in and  in net sales increased in from with approximately half of the increase due to a weaker us dollar versus foreign currencies 
net sales decreased in from the decrease in would have been approximately greater excluding the effect of a weaker us dollar versus foreign currencies 
we experienced strong double digit growth in the first half of fiscal  as the electronics industry and the targeted industries we serve  in particular  the semiconductor  wireless communications and optoelectronics industries  were growing 
however  the downturn in the electronics industry had a negative effect on results for the remainder of fiscal  all of and into as fiscal progressed  we noted stabilizing conditions and the start of a soft recovery in the electronics industry 
geographically  sales were down in the united states  up in europe  and up in the pacific basin region during in  sales were down in the united states  in europe  and in the pacific basin region from cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to higher costs related to the lean manufacturing startup and a less favorable product mix  partially offset by higher margins in japan as a result of going direct  and better margins in europe due to a weaker dollar 
cost of goods sold in was negatively impacted by product mix  as well as spreading fixed costs over lower manufacturing volumes 
this was partially offset by a weaker dollar 
foreign exchange hedging had a minimal effect on cost of goods sold in  and selling  general and administrative expenses of  increased in from  in  and decreased in from  in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were  and  in  and  respectively 
the increase in over was due primarily to higher sales and support costs related to the japanese sales office that opened april   higher costs related to the us sales force during the first quarter as we paid commissions to sales representatives and salaries to our own sales employees  higher costs in europe due to a weaker dollar  and additional costs associated with the erp and crm implementations 
the decrease in was due primarily to lower discretionary spending  lower commissions on lower sales  and lower incentive compensation costs  offset partially by higher costs to open sales and support offices in the pacific basin 

table of contents product development expenses of  decreased from  in  and decreased in from  in product development expenses as a percentage of net sales were  and  in  and  respectively 
the decrease in was due primarily to more engineering time being spent in manufacturing for lean manufacturing startup support 
the decrease in from is the result of lower incentive compensation costs due to the net loss recorded in  as well as lower discretionary spending 
during fiscal  we recorded pretax  or 
per share after taxes  for severance charges relating to a reduction in force of individuals  or less than of the worldwide work force 
the majority of the individuals were in sales or sales support functions 
during fiscal  we recorded a  pretax charge  or 
per share after taxes  for severance relating to a reduction in force of individuals  or approximately percent of the worldwide work force  the majority of whom were in manufacturing 
the charges in both years include salaries and vacation pursuant to each individuals severance agreement  payroll taxes  health insurance and pension costs 
cash payments of in and  in were made for severance 
at september  and  and  respectively  was included in the accrued payroll and related expenses caption of the consolidated balance sheets 
see note j 
we generated net financing income of in  in and  in lower interest rates and lower average cash and short term investments levels accounted for the decrease in the decrease in was due to lower interest rates  despite having higher average cash and short term investments in versus we recorded a tax benefit for at a effective rate 
the benefit was lower than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain tax credits where we determined it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset related to those credits would not be realized 
see note i 
we recorded a tax benefit for at a effective rate 
the benefit was higher than the statutory tax rate due to foreign tax credit carryforwards 
the effective tax rate for was  and was lower than the statutory tax rate for federal  state and local taxes due to foreign sales corporation benefits 
our financial results are affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
generally  a weakening us dollar causes the price of our products to be more attractive in foreign markets and favorably impacts our sales and earnings 
a strengthening us dollar has an unfavorable effect 
this foreign exchange effect cannot be precisely isolated since many other factors affect our foreign sales and earnings 
these factors include product offerings and pricing policies of keithley and our competition  whether competition is foreign or us based  changes in technology  product and customer mix  and local and worldwide economic conditions 
we utilize hedging techniques designed to mitigate the short term effect of exchange rate fluctuations on operations and balance sheet positions by entering into forward currency contracts 
we do not speculate in foreign currencies or derivative financial instruments  and hedging techniques do not increase our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was  in fiscal cash and cash equivalents decreased  to  at september  short term investments decreased  to  at september  cash and short term investments were used to purchase  of property  plant and equipment  to purchase  common shares through our stock repurchase program for  to pay  in dividends  to contribute  to the united states pension plan  and to fund the working capital needs of our business 
total debt of at september  decreased from september  the company s credit agreement  which expires march   is a  debt facility outstanding at september  that provides unsecured  multi currency revolving credit at various interest rates based on prime or libor 
we are required to pay a facility fee of on the total amount of the commitment 
additionally  we have a number of other credit facilities in various currencies aggregating  outstanding at september  
we intend to extend the terms of the credit agreement with the bank or seek to enter into a new credit agreement to provide access to capital should the need arise beyond march  at september   we had total unused lines of credit with domestic and foreign banks aggregating  all of which was short term 
under certain provisions of the debt agreements  we are required to comply with various financial ratios and covenants 
we were in compliance with all such debt covenants  as amended  during each of the three years ended and at september  our current stock repurchase program expires on december  under the current program we may repurchase an additional  common shares through december  on december   the board of directors approved a new plan authorizing the repurchase of  common shares through december  during  we expect to finance capital spending  working capital requirements and the stock repurchase program with cash and short term investments on hand and cash provided by operations 
capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to approximate

recent accounting pronouncements in october  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this standard addresses revenue recognition accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
this statement became effective for the company s fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of the provisions of this statement did not have a material effect on our consolidated results or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial position 
the required disclosure provisions of this statement are included in note b to these consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this standard amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this standard amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition provisions of sfas no 
are not applicable to keithley since the expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
have not been adopted 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in october  the fasb indicated that it would require all companies to expense stock options 
it plans to issue an exposure draft in early that could become effective in in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  subsequent to which certain amendments and clarifications were issued 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
the consolidation requirements of fin applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to entities created prior to february  in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december  we do not expect the provisions of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial position  as we currently have no variable interest entities 
in april  sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
was issued by the fasb 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to clarify the definition of a derivative and incorporate many of the implementation issues cleared as a result of the derivatives implementation group process 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  and should be applied prospectively after that date 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
this statement was effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise was effective for our fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated results or financial position  as we currently have no financial instruments to which this standard applies 

table of contents factors that may affect future results statements included in the sections entitled general  and liquidity and capital resources of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  in the letter to shareholders in the annual report  and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements  as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements generally include words such as anticipates  expects  believes  intends  estimates  and similar expressions 
such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected including those discussed below 
except as otherwise required by applicable securities laws  the company disclaims any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the company is subject to global economic and market conditions  including the current conditions affecting the results of our customers in certain segments of the electronics industry 
the current economic downturn resulted in reduced purchasing and capital spending in many of the markets that we serve worldwide 
in particular  the communications  semiconductor and electronics industries have been in a downward cycle characterized by diminished product demand and excess manufacturing capacity 
although some segments of these industries have shown recent signs of stabilization and or improvement  others  especially in the optoelectronics segment of the communications industry  continue to be very weak 
the ultimate severity of this downturn  and how long it will last  is unknown 
demand in our markets remains volatile so the underlying trend is uncertain 
our results have been and could continue to be adversely affected depending upon future business conditions in these industries 
the company has been experiencing some pricing pressures from our customers  which could reduce gross margins 
in addition  our orders are cancelable by customers and consequently orders outstanding at the end of a reporting period may not result in realized sales in the future 
we are managing our cost structure to reduce overall costs  as well as reallocate resources to areas that we feel will provide the best long term benefit to our customers and shareholders 
if we fail to cuts costs and manage expenses in a timely manner  operating results will be adversely affected 
in addition  notwithstanding such measures  a continuing decline in the economy that adversely affects our customers would likely adversely affect our business 
our business relies on the development of new high technology products and services to provide solutions to our customers complex measurement needs 
this requires anticipation of customers changing needs and emerging technology trends 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our expectations will eventually result in products that achieve market acceptance 
we incur significant expenses developing new products that may or may not result in significant sources of revenue and earnings in the future 
in many cases our products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers 
if any of our competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for our product offerings could slow 
our products contain large volumes of electronic components and subassemblies that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers 
although we do not anticipate any problems procuring supplies in the near term  there can never be any assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
additionally  our inventory is subject to risks of changes in market demand for particular products 
the resulting excess and or obsolete inventory could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we currently have subsidiaries or sales offices located in countries outside the united states  and non us sales accounted for two thirds of our revenue during fiscal our future results could be adversely affected by several factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  political unrest  wars and other acts of terrorism  changes in other economic or political conditions  trade protection measures  import or export licensing requirements  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  natural disasters  and the potential for a reoccurrence of the sars virus 
we began to implement a lean manufacturing initiative in our manufacturing facilities  which are located in solon  ohio 
we incurred start up costs during fiscal and fiscal  which adversely affected gross margins 
the next phase of the lean implementation involves fine tuning processes and improving execution 
our results  as well as the benefits we expect to derive from lean manufacturing  could be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively implement the next phase of the lean manufacturing initiative 
we pay taxes in several jurisdictions throughout the world 
we utilize available tax credits and other tax planning strategies in an effort to minimize our overall tax liability 
our estimated tax rate for fiscal could change from what is currently anticipated due to changes in tax laws of various countries  changes in our overall tax planning strategy  or countries where earnings or losses are incurred 
at september   we had a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  and had not established valuation allowances against other deferred tax assets based on tax strategies planned to mitigate the risk of impairment to these assets 
accordingly  if facts or financial results were to change thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  our tax rate and therefore our earnings could be adversely affected 
on january   we began to use our own employees  rather than sales representatives  to sell our products in the united states 
we believe we have regained the momentum lost during the transition period  and expect the momentum will continue to build 
however  this action raised our fixed costs and our results could be adversely affected during times of depressed sales 

table of contents throughout fiscal  we will continue our implementation of erp and crm systems 
our results could be adversely affected if we are unable to implement the systems without significant interruptions in accounting systems  order entry  billing  manufacturing and other customer support functions 
other risk factors include but are not limited to changes in the mix of products sold  which affects our gross margins  credit risk of customers  potential litigation  claims  regulatory and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of business  as well as terrorist activities and armed conflicts 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including foreign currency fluctuations  interest rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its short term investments 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values and interest rates 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk primarily through transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
we currently utilize foreign exchange forward contracts or option contracts to sell foreign currencies to fix the exchange rates related to near term sales and effectively fix our margins 
generally  these contracts have maturities of three months or less 
our policy is to only enter into derivative transactions when we have an identifiable exposure to risk  thus not creating additional foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in our opinion  a percent adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on these instruments and therefore our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company also has an interest rate swap instrument originally entered into to mitigate the risk of interest rate changes related to long term debt 
the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on a notional  of variable rate debt  however  the interest rate swap instrument was determined to be an ineffective hedge and accordingly  changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap are recorded in the company s records as income or expense 
the instrument expires september  in management s opinion  a percent adverse change in interest rates would not have a material effect on this instrument and therefore on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
the company maintains a short term investment portfolio consisting of united states government backed notes and bonds  corporate notes and bonds  and mutual funds consisting primarily of government notes and bonds 
an increase in interest rates would decrease the value of certain of these investments 
however  a percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows
