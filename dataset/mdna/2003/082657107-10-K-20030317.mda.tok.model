item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a specialty pharmaceutical company operating in two business segments research  development and licensing commercialization of advanced drug delivery technologies and pharmaceutical products  and manufacturing and selling of generic and branded pharmaceutical products 
a substantial part of our operations is in spain  where we manufacture and market generic and branded pharmaceutical products and from which market we derive the majority of our sales 
our primary objective is to be a leading specialty pharmaceutical company focused on advanced drug delivery and formulation technologies that improve the effectiveness of existing and new pharmaceuticals 
we have patents and proprietary technologies that enhance or facilitate the absorption of drugs across membranes of the skin  mouth  nose  vagina and eye 
we are developing products incorporating these technologies and seek to form strategic alliances with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to facilitate the development and commercialization of our products 
we currently have strategic alliances with pfizer and auxilium and are in preliminary discussions with a number of other pharmaceutical companies to form additional alliances 
we entered into a research services agreement with auxilium  an emerging therapeutic pharmaceutical company focused on diseases related to aging to develop and test various pharmaceutical compositions of a topical testosterone using our cpe permeation enhancement technology 
we have licensed our drug delivery technology to auxilium for use in the development and commercialization of testim  a topical testosterone product 
clinical trials performed by auxilium for the approval of this product in the us have been completed  a new drug application was approved by the fda on october  and testim was launched by auxilium in february we entered into a research collaboration with pfizer in which we were granted a non exclusive worldwide royalty free license to use pfizer s compounds and technology to assess the performance of our cpe technology with pfizer s compounds 
as part of the agreement  we granted to pfizer the non exclusive right to test the ability of our cpe technology to enhance delivery of certain compounds proprietary to pfizer 
we entered into a strategic alliance with teva in july whereby we  through our spanish subsidiaries  received the right to register and sell in spain more than of teva s products 
the products are comprised of both branded and generic forms 
sales from the products are expected to begin gradually  but will progress over the next two to three years 
an investment in additional sales representatives has been and will continue to be required  along with an increase in regulatory activities  both of which may create a short term decrease in our earnings 
through our subsidiary  laboratorios davur sl  we also submitted registrations to the spanish ministry of health for generic versions of various products in response to growing interest in generic drug products in spain 
we believe that gross margins may be lower on sales of these products 
we manufacture generic and branded pharmaceutical products in our zaragoza  spain facility and sell and market these products to physicians and pharmacists throughout spain 
in addition to manufacturing our own products  we utilize our excess capacity by acting as a contract manufacturer for other pharmaceutical companies 
we have not realized domestic taxable income to date 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future domestic taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately  million 
our us federal net operating loss carryforwards  if not utilized  expire at various dates from to we have recorded a valuation allowance against our entire future tax benefit arising from our domestic net operating losses 
the future utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited pursuant to us tax regulations 
results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net product sales 
net product sales increased by from  in to  in the  increase was primarily the result of our continuing efforts to increase sales in the generic drug market in spain 
we anticipated the opportunities in the emerging generic drug market in spain and began taking measures over four years ago to enter the spanish generic drug market 
we began to register  manufacture and market generic pharmaceutical products in spain and began aligning our business model to be competitive in this arena  including hiring and training a new generic products sales force  submission of generic equivalent products to the spanish ministry of health for approval and a marketing campaign designed to position ourselves as a leader in the spanish generic drug market 
we experienced an increase in net sales of in local currency in spain in compared to the prior year 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  over the past months  had the effect of increasing revenues by approximately  during the year ended december  prices for prescription pharmaceuticals have been established in spain by the ministry of health 
in order to control rising healthcare costs  substitution of generically equivalent products is often encouraged 
in certain circumstances  the local governments in spain require that prescriptions for generic medications be filled using one of the three cheapest products on the market unless the prescription specifies a particular manufacturer s product 
these policies may have the effect of eroding gross margins  as sales of higher priced branded products may be replaced with sales of lower priced generic products 
we are striving to maintain product sales and gross margins by concentrating our efforts on increasing sales volume  being competitive in the generic drug market  developing new products and increasing exports outside spain 
licensing and collaboration revenues 
licensing and collaboration revenues totaled  in we entered into a research collaboration whereby our collaborator agreed to fund a research and development program to combine bentley s patented cpe drug delivery technologies with certain proprietary compounds 
our collaborator advanced to us  during the fourth quarter of  which we recorded as deferred income as of december   and we recognized it as revenue as the related costs were incurred 
we also recognized revenues totaling  during the year ended december   related to product licensing activities  which we have included in the consolidated statement of operations as licensing and collaboration revenue 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by from  in to  in the  increase was the direct result of the growth in our net product sales from to our gross margins on net product sales in increased slightly to compared to in the prior year as result of economies of scale allocation of fixed costs over a larger number of units  reducing the per unit cost  partially offset by lower margins of generic products  which typically have lower prices 
we experienced an increase in gross profit of in local currency in compared to the prior year 
an increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar over the past months  had the effect of increasing gross profit by approximately  during the year ended december  sales of generic products accounted for approximately of our net product sales during the year ended december   compared to in the prior year 
although we expect to continue to benefit from economies of scale in the future as we grow  gross margins may decrease as sales of generic products  with lower margins  become more significant in the future 
additionally  the ministry of health in spain levies a tax on pharmaceutical companies for the purpose of funding rising healthcare costs in spain 
in  this tax had the effect of reducing gross profit by approximately  and gross margins by approximately percentage point 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased by from  in to  in the  increase was instrumental in achieving a increase in net product sales during the period  as a result of our successful sales and marketing programs

general and administrative expenses increased by from  in to  in the  increase was the result of increased general and administrative activities required to support our revenue growth in general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues decreased to only in  compared to of revenues in general and administrative expenses would have been approximately  lower in  absent the increase in the weighted average value of the euro  in relation to the us dollar  over the past months 
we expect that our future expenditures for general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as we grow 
although we cannot reasonably estimate the costs associated with implementation of the internal controls provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  we do expect to incur costs not previously experienced  however  we do not believe that these costs will be material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by from  in to  in the  increase was the result of an increase in our costs associated with our research and development collaboration as well as our phase i ii clinical studies treatment of nail fungal infections  pre clinical programs underway in collaboration with universities and with product formulation and testing efforts being performed in the laboratory in our us headquarters and at our facility in zaragoza  spain 
we are using our us laboratory to develop potential product applications using our drug delivery technologies 
the expenditures in research and development reflect our focus on projects that are necessary for expansion of our portfolio of marketed products and clinical trials involving our drug delivery technologies 
we expect that our future expenditures for research and development activities will continue to increase as a result of programs that are necessary to advance new applications of our technologies 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by from  in to  in the  increase in was primarily the result of higher depreciation charges with respect to recent asset additions and the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates

in comparison  we sold no generic drug products during the first three quarters of the prior year

seasonality  effect of inflation and liquidity 
in the past  we have experienced lower sales in the third calendar quarter and higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to seasonality

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies include o inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
we evaluate the adequacy of these reserves quarterly 
o revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and consider delivery to have occurred when the customer takes possession of the products 
we provide our customers with a limited right of return 
revenue is recognized upon delivery of products and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with sfas no 
and of allowances for doubtful accounts based on significant historical experience 
revenue from service sales is recognized when the service procedures have been completed or applicable milestones have been achieved 
revenue from research and development contracts is recognized over applicable contractual periods or as defined milestones are attained  as specified by each contract and as costs related to the contracts are incurred 
o foreign currency translation 
the financial position and results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities of each foreign subsidiary are translated at the rate of exchange in effect at the end of the period 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period 
foreign currency translation gains and losses are credited to or charged against other comprehensive income loss 
foreign currency translation gains and losses arising from cash transactions are credited to or charged against current earnings 
o drug licenses and related costs 
drug licenses and related costs incurred in connection with acquiring licenses  patents and other proprietary rights related to our commercially developed products are capitalized 
capitalized drug licenses and related costs are being amortized on a straight line basis for periods not exceeding years from the dates of acquisition 
carrying of such assets are reviewed quarterly by comparing the carrying amounts to their estimated undiscounted cash flows and adjustments are made for any diminution in value 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
supersedes apb opinion no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises  and requires that all business combinations be accounted for by a single method the purchase method 
sfas no 
also provides guidance on the recognition of intangible assets identified in a business combination and requires enhanced financial statement disclosures 
sfas no 
adopts a more aggregate view of goodwill and bases the accounting for goodwill on the units of the combined entity into which an acquired entity is integrated 
in addition  sfas no 
concludes that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives will not be amortized  but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june  the adoption of sfas no 
was required for fiscal years beginning after december   except for the nonamortization and amortization provisions which are required for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june  the adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes previous guidelines for financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
the adoption of sfas no 
 on january   did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies  the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
the disclosure provision is required for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether the company utilizes the fair value method of accounting described in sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
s amendment of the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure provisions for interim financial statements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we currently account for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation described by apb opinion no 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin as of december  and determined that no additional disclosures were required 
in addition  we are required to adopt the initial recognition and measurement of the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe fin will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
establishes three principles revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting  arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  and revenue recognition criteria should be considered separately for separate units of accounting 
eitf issue no 
is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
we do not believe eitf issue no 
will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products  which is a codification of eitf issues no 
 and this issue presumes that consideration from a vendor to a customer or reseller of the vendor s products to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenues under certain circumstances 
revenue reduction is required unless consideration relates to a separate identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established 
eitf issue no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency 
a substantial amount of our business is conducted in europe and is therefore influenced to the extent to which there are fluctuations in the us dollar s value against other currencies  specifically the euro 
the exchange rate at december  and was 
euros and euros per us dollar  respectively 
the weighted average exchange rate for the years ended december   and was euros  euros and euros per us dollar  respectively 
the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on long lived assets for the year ended december  was an increase of  and the cumulative historical effect was a decrease of  as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as accumulated other comprehensive loss 
although exchange rates fluctuated significantly in recent years  we do not believe that the effect of foreign currency fluctuation is material to our results of operations as the expenses related to much of our foreign currency revenues are in the same currency as such revenues 
however  the carrying value of assets and reported values can be materially impacted by foreign currency translation  as can the translated amounts of revenues and expenses 
nonetheless  we do not plan to modify our business practices 
we have relied primarily upon financing activities to fund our operations in the us in the event that we are required to fund us operations or cash needs with funds generated in spain  currency rate fluctuations in the future could have a significant impact on us 
however  at the present time  we do not anticipate altering our business plans and practices to compensate for future currency fluctuations 
interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate on our short term borrowings and current portion of long term debt is and the balance outstanding is  as of december  a portion of our long term borrowings is non interest bearing and the balance outstanding on these borrowings at december  is  including imputed interest ranging from to of  the balance of our long term borrowings of  bears interest at the rate of 
consequently  the weighted average interest rate on our long term borrowings is 
the effect of an increase in the interest rate of one percentage point one hundred basis points to on short term borrowings and to on long term borrowings would have the effect of increasing interest expense by approximately  annually
