item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net loss for fiscal was million  compared to million in fiscal and  million in fiscal reasons for the substantial improvement in our results in fiscal are described in more detail in the results of operations and liquidity and capital resources sections of item however  some of the key factors that impacted this improvement are summarized as follows productivity of existing store base 
our strategy is to focus on improving the productivity of our existing store base 
we have focused our efforts on improving the productivity of our stores by implementing programs to drive prescription count growth  improving the consistency and focus of our marketing efforts  improving our product categories to offer more personalized products and service to our customers  increasing our mix of private brand and generic drug sales  developing programs that are specifically directed toward improving our pharmacy service and implementing associate programs that create compensatory and other incentives for associates to provide customers with better service 
we believe that our improvements in revenues  gross margin as a percentage of sales and selling  general and administrative costs sg a as a percent of sales that are detailed in the results of operations section are a direct result of our success in implementing the strategy of improving the productivity of our stores  evidenced by a rise in average revenue per store from million in fiscal to million in fiscal debt refinancing 
in fiscal and  we took several steps to reduce our debt load and improve our leverage 
the most significant item was a substantial refinancing in fiscal  which extended the maturity of the majority of our debt  converted a portion of our debt to equity and rescinded purchase options on certain sale leaseback leases  resulting in their reclassification from capital leases to operating leases 
these activities resulted in aggregate charges of million in fiscal in fiscal  we converted a portion of our debt to equity  which resulted in charges of million 
these steps have enabled us to reduce our debt from billion as of february  to billion as of march   and to extend the maturity of the majority of our debt to and beyond 
divestiture of non core businesses 
during the past three years  we have divested our investments in non core operations 
these divestitures were necessary to enable us to focus on our core business of operating retail drug stores and resulted in significant charges or credits in the periods presented 
these transactions are described below 
on october   we sold pcs  our pbm segment  to advance paradigm now advancepcs 
the selling price of pcs consisted of million in cash  million in principal amount of advancepcs promissory notes and advancepcs equity securities 
accordingly  the pbm segment is presented as a discontinued operation in the fiscal financial statements and the operating income of the pbm segment through october   the date of sale  is reflected separately from the income from continuing operations 
the loss on the disposal of the pbm segment was million  which was recorded in fiscal also recorded in fiscal was an increase to the tax valuation allowance and income tax expense of million related to this disposal 
in march  we sold our investment in advancepcs equity securities for million  resulting in a gain of million  which was recorded in fiscal additionally  advancepcs repurchased the promissory notes for million  plus accrued interest 
in july  we purchased shares of drugstore 
com  an on line pharmacy  and entered into an agreement to provide access to our networks of pharmacies and third party providers  advertising commitments and exclusivity agreements 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges of million to write down our investment in drugstore 
com  based upon declines in the market value of drugstore 
com stock which we concluded were other than temporary 
in january  april and may  we sold our shares of drugstore 
com  and as of march  have no investment in drugstore 
com 
we recorded gains from these sales of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
closure of under performing stores 
in fiscal  and  we performed a rigorous review of underperforming stores  and  based on these reviews  decided to close  and stores in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of these reviews  we have recorded store closing and related impairment charges of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe that these closures were necessary to improve the productivity of our remaining store base and to eliminate underperforming stores 
as part of our ongoing business activities  we will continue to assess stores for potential closure 
there can be no assurance that other such actions may not be required in the future  or that such actions would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period in which we take those actions 
substantial investigation expenses 
we have incurred substantial expenses in connection with defense against litigation related to prior management s business practices and the defense of prior management 
in fiscal  we also incurred expenses in connection with the process of reviewing and reconciling our books and records  restating our and financial statements  investigating our prior accounting practices  preparing our financial statements and defending our company in pending investigations 
we incurred million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect to incur approximately million in fiscal  and expect to continue to incur significant legal and other expenses until the resolution of the us attorney s case against certain of our former executive officers and the investigation of certain other matters 
dilutive equity issuances 
at march   million shares of common stock were outstanding and an additional million shares of common stock were issuable related to outstanding stock options  convertible notes and preferred stock 
our million shares of common stock potentially issuable consist of the following

a the exercise of these options would provide cash of million 
b the conversion of these notes to equity would reduce the principal amount of debt by million 
working capital 
we generally finance our inventory and capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and borrowings 
we expect to use borrowings to finance inventories and to support our continued growth 
the majority of our front end sales are in cash 
third party payors  which typically settle in fewer than days  accounted for of our pharmacy sales and of our revenues in fiscal industry trends 
we believe pharmacy sales in the united states will increase at least over the next three years based upon studies published by pharmacy benefit management companies and the congressional budget office 
this anticipated growth is expected to be driven by the baby boom generation entering their fifties  the increasing life expectancy of the american population  the introduction of several new drugs and inflation 
the retail drugstore industry is highly fragmented and has been experiencing consolidation 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
we expect to continue to compete on the basis of service and convenience  and therefore  will continue to focus on programs designed to improve our image with customers 
prescription drug sales continue to represent a greater portion of our business due to the general aging of the population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs 
in addition  sales of generic pharmaceuticals continue to grow as a percentage of total prescription drug sales 
the growth rate of prescription drug sales has also been impacted by factors such as the increased sales of lower priced generic pharmaceuticals and slower introductions of successful new prescription drugs 
in fiscal of our pharmacy sales were to third party payors 
some third party payors  especially state sponsored medicaid agencies  have recently evaluated and reduced certain reimbursement levels 
also  modifications to the medicare program are being studied that would expand coverage of prescription drugs 
if third party payors  including state sponsored medicaid agencies  further reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices  our margins on these sales would be reduced and the profitability of our business could be adversely affected

note except for revenue growth  all percentages in the above table are based on a comparable week period 
revenues the growth in revenues for fiscal was driven by pharmacy sales growth of  offset slightly by a front end sales decline of 
the decline in front end sales was a direct result of closing stores in fiscal  partially offset by front end same store sales growth of 
fiscal pharmacy same store sales increased by  due to increases in both prescriptions filled and sales price per prescription 
factors contributing to our pharmacy same store sales increase include inflation  improved attraction and retention of managed care customers  our increased focus on pharmacy initiatives  such as predictive refill  and favorable industry trends 
these trends include an aging population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs 
these favorable factors were partially offset by the increase in generic sales mix  a reduction in hormone replacement therapy prescriptions and the impact of a less severe flu season than in the prior year 
fiscal front end same store sales increased  primarily as a result of improvement in most core categories  such as over the counter items  consumables and vitamins and improved assortments 
fiscal weeks revenues increased over fiscal weeks 
excluding the extra week  revenues would have increased  driven by increases of in front end and in pharmacy 
same store sales growth for fiscal was pharmacy of and front end of 
as fiscal was a week year  same store sales are calculated by comparing the week period ended march  with the week period ended march fiscal pharmacy sales led sales growth due to an increase in both prescriptions filled on a comparable week basis and sales price per prescription 
factors contributing to our pharmacy same store sales increases include inflation  improved attraction and retention of managed care customers  our reduced cash pricing  our increased focus on pharmacy initiatives  such as predictive refill  and favorable industry trends 
these trends include an aging population  the use of pharmaceuticals to treat a growing number of healthcare problems  and the introduction of a number of successful new prescription drugs 
front end fiscal sales also increased 
the increase was primarily a result of increased sales volume due to improved assortments  lower prices on key items and distributing a nationwide weekly advertising circular 
our total revenue growth in fiscal of was also fueled by strong growth in pharmacy sales of  an increase in front end sales of and the additional week in fiscal pharmacy sales led revenue growth with same store sales increases of accompanied by very strong front end same store sales growth of 
the pharmacy and front end increases were due to the same factors as described above for fiscal costs and expenses

cost of goods sold gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin was positively impacted by improvements in pharmacy margin  driven by increased generic mix and improved third party reimbursements 
gross margin was also positively impacted by a decrease in the lifo provision  due to a lower rate of inflation  and flat occupancy expense on a higher sales base 
although front end margin rate was flat  the lower mix of front end sales caused a decline in front end margin contribution  which partially offset the positive pharmacy margin contribution 
gross margin was for fiscal compared to in fiscal gross margin was negatively impacted by the continuing trend of a shift in sales mix from front end to pharmacy  inflation  increased third party reimbursed prescription sales as a percent of total prescription sales  and lower cash prices on pharmacy sales 
additionally  we incurred million in inventory liquidation losses related to our closed stores compared to the million incurred in fiscal also negatively impacting gross margin were higher lifo costs  higher shrink costs and the reclassification of certain leases from capital to operating in connection with the june refinancing  which caused an increase in fiscal occupancy costs 
partially offsetting these items was an increase in gross margin on front end merchandise driven by increased markdown support from vendors  improvements in returns losses and lower depreciation expense 
we use the last in  first out lifo method of inventory valuation 
the lifo charge was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal includes million incurred primarily to defend against litigation related to prior management s business practices and to defend prior management

sg a expenses for fiscal include million incurred to defend against litigation related to prior management s business practices and to defend prior management 
also included in sg a expense for fiscal is a charge of million to terminate an exclusivity contract with a certain vendor 
offsetting these items are net receipts of million related to litigation and million of expense reduction resulting primarily from senior executives releasing their rights to their non qualified defined benefit arrangements 
after considering the items described in the previous paragraphs  sg a was lower in fiscal than fiscal due to decreased depreciation and amortization charges resulting from a reduced store count  reduction in professional fees and better leveraging of our fixed costs resulting from higher sales volume  partially offset by higher associate benefit costs 
sg a expenses for fiscal were favorably impacted by credits of million related to litigation  offset by charges of million incurred in connection with the restatement of our historical financial statements and various governmental investigations

impairment charges in fiscal  and  store closing and impairment charges include non cash charges of million  million and million  respectively  for the impairment of long lived assets including allocable goodwill for fiscal and at  and stores  respectively 
these amounts include the write down of long lived assets to estimated fair value at stores that were assessed for impairment as part of our on going review of the performance of our stores or management s intention to relocate or close the store 
store and equipment lease exit charges in fiscal  and  we recorded charges for  and stores  respectively  to be closed or relocated under long term leases 
charges incurred to close a store  which principally consist of lease termination costs  are recorded at the time management commits to closing the store  which is the date that the closure is formally approved by senior management  or in the case of a store to be relocated  the date the new property is leased or purchased 
effective january   we adopted sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
pursuant to the adoption of sfas  we now record costs to close the store at the time the store is closed and all inventory is liquidated 
we calculate our liability for closed stores on a store by store basis 
the calculation includes the future minimum lease payments and related ancillary costs  from the date of closure to the end of the remaining lease term  net of estimated cost recoveries that may be achieved through subletting properties or through favorable lease terminations 
this liability is discounted using a risk free rate of interest 
we evaluate these assumptions each quarter and adjust the liability accordingly 
also included in store and equipment lease exit costs are charges of million incurred in fiscal related to the early termination of an equipment lease 
impairment of investments we had an investment in the common stock of drugstore 
com  which was accounted for under the equity method 
the initial investment was valued based upon the initial public offering price for drugstore 
com 
during fiscal  we recorded an impairment of our investment in drugstore 
com of million 
this write down was based upon a decline in the market value of drugstore 
com s stock that we believed to be other than temporary 
additionally  we recorded impairment charges of million in fiscal for other investments 
interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from fiscal due to the reduction of debt resulting from the retirement and repurchase of certain notes  and the reduction in libor rates  which reduced our interest rate on the senior secured credit facility 
interest expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense for fiscal decreased from due to the reduction of debt resulting from the sale of pcs  debt for equity exchanges and the june refinancing  which included the relinquishment of certain renewal options on real estate leases that resulted in a reclassification from capital leases to operating leases 
the annual weighted average interest rates on our indebtedness in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were  and respectively 
interest rate swap contracts we entered into two year interest rate swap contracts in june and july of to hedge the exposure to increasing rates with respect to our variable rate debt 
as a result of the june refinancing  the interest rate swap contracts no longer qualified for hedge accounting treatment  and therefore the changes in fair value of these interest rate swap contracts were required to be recorded as components of net loss 
accordingly  we recognized an initial charge of million and subsequent changes in the market value of the interest rate swaps of million  inclusive of cash payments  which resulted in a charge of million for fiscal changes in market value of the interest rate swaps in fiscal were not significant 
these contracts expired and were fully funded during fiscal and have not been renewed 
correspondingly  there is no termination liability as of march  income taxes we had net losses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal a tax benefit of million  a benefit of million and expense of million have been recorded for fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal benefit resulted primarily from a federal law change  enacted on march   which increased the carryback period of net operating losses incurred in fiscal and from two years to five 
the fiscal benefit is primarily due to the favorable outcome of federal income tax litigation 
the fiscal expense is primarily due to the increase in the income tax valuation allowance caused by the sale of pcs 
the benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards nols generated in each period has been fully offset by a valuation allowance as a result of management s determination that  based on available evidence  it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have undergone an ownership change for statutory tax purposes during fiscal  which resulted in a limitation on the future use of net operating loss carryforwards 
we believe that this limitation does not further impair the net operating loss carryforwards because they are fully reserved 
during fiscal  we received federal income tax refunds in the amount of million based on the favorable outcome of federal income tax litigation and tax law changes permitting the five year carryback of nol s 
other significant charges in addition to the matters discussed above  our results in fiscal  and have been impacted by other significant charges 
we recorded losses of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  representing our share of drugstore 
com losses 
we recorded million and million in fiscal and  respectively  for losses on debt and lease conversions and modifications and extraordinary gains of million and extraordinary losses of million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  relating to early extinguishment of debt 
we recorded stock based compensation expense benefit of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  resulting primarily from the impact of applying variable plan accounting to several of our stock based compensation plans 
we recorded a gain of million in fiscal resulting from the sale of our investment in drugstore 
com 
we also recorded a gain of million in fiscal resulting from the sale of advancepcs securities 
in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million on the disposal of the pbm segment 
liquidity and capital resources recent changes to our capital structure and proposed new credit facility in february  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due in april  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured notes due the notes and the notes are unsecured  unsubordinated obligations of rite aid corporation and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured  unsubordinated indebtedness 
our obligations under the notes are guaranteed  subject to certain limitations  by our subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our senior credit facility 
the guarantees are secured  subject to permitted liens  by shared second priority liens granted by our subsidiary guarantors on all of their assets that secure our obligations under the senior credit facility  subject to certain exceptions 
the indentures governing the senior secured notes contain customary covenant provisions that  among other things  include limitations on our ability to pay dividends or make investments or other restricted payments  incur debt  grant liens  sell assets and enter into sale leaseback transactions 
in connection with the offering of the senior secured notes and other debt retirement activities through april  we redeemed all million aggregate principal amount of our senior secured shareholder notes due prior to march   we retired million of our fixed rate senior notes due  prior to march   we retired million of our notes due prior to march  we retired an additional million of our notes due subsequent to march   and we retired an additional million of our fixed rate senior notes due subsequent to march  separately  in march  we made a scheduled principal payment of million under our senior secured credit facility 
we used a portion of the proceeds of the senior secured notes to repay approximately million of our term loan under our senior secured credit facility 
the remaining million will be used for general corporate purposes  which may include capital expenditures and debt repurchases 
in connection with the insurance of the senior secured notes  we also permanently reduced our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility by the amount of the remainder of the net proceeds

in april  we announced that we intend to replace our existing senior secured credit facility with a new billion senior secured credit facility that will consist of a billion term loan and a million revolving credit facility that will mature in april our obligations under the proposed new senior secured credit facility will be guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under our existing senior credit facility 
these subsidiary guarantees will be secured by a first priority security interest in substantially the same collateral that secures the guarantees under our existing senior credit facility and will secure the guarantees of the notes on a second priority basis 
the proceeds of the new senior secured credit facility will be used to repay outstanding amounts under our existing credit facility  to refinance our synthetic lease  and to replace our existing revolving credit facility 
closing of the new facility is subject to negotiation of definitive documentation  successful syndication and satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
we expect to enter into the new credit facility by the end of may general we have two primary sources of liquidity i cash provided by operations and ii the revolving credit facility under our senior secured credit facility 
our principal uses of cash are to provide working capital for operations  service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  to provide funds for capital expenditures and to provide funds available for repurchases of our publicly traded debt 
our ability to borrow under the senior credit facility is based on a specified borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
on march   we had million in additional available borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
as of march   the term loan was fully drawn 
in connection with the april issuance of million of our senior secured notes  we agreed to reduce our revolving credit commitment under our senior credit facility by million 
on december   we entered into an amendment of our senior secured credit facility to allow us to make optional repurchases of our publicly traded debt 
for the period from december  to the end of our fiscal year  we will be permitted to utilize up to million for optional debt repurchases  provided that we are in compliance with the capital expenditures covenant of our senior credit facility 
for fiscal years after  we will have an amount available for optional debt repurchases equal to the lesser of our availability under the capital expenditures covenant and a formula based upon our performance for the prior fiscal year 
on february  we entered into an additional amendment to our senior credit facility to allow us more flexibility in making optional debt repurchases 
the amendment enabled us to purchase an additional million of our publicly traded debt with the net proceeds of additional debt issuances 
the amendment also modified certain debt refinancing provisions  including extending the term that new refinancing debt must carry to at least december  after giving effect to these amendments  and adjusting for repurchases made since the amendment dates  we have the ability to repuchase debt of up to million at april  the senior secured credit facility  as amended  also allows us  at our option  to issue up to billion of unsecured debt that is not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries  reduced by the following debt to the extent incurred i million of financing transactions of existing owned real estate  ii billion of additional debt secured by the facility s collateral on a second priority basis  and iii million of financing transactions for property or assets acquired after june  the billion of permitted debt  whether secured or unsecured  is reduced by the outstanding balances of specific debt and the synthetic lease such that  our remaining additional permitted debt under the senior secured credit facility at april  is million 
our senior notes due july also permit million of real estate financing  million of additional other debt and million of additional permitted debt  which includes allowing us to increase our senior secured credit facility 
as of april   our remaining additional permitted debt under the senior notes due  excluding availability under our senior secured credit facility  real estate financing and after reduction for the outstanding balances of specific debt  was approximately million 
the indentures governing our senior secured notes due and our senior secured notes due also limit our ability to incur indebtedness 
the senior secured credit facility  as amended  requires us to meet various financial ratios and limits capital expenditures 
beginning with the months ended march   the covenants require us to maintain a maximum leverage ratio of  which gradually decreases to for the twelve months ending february  we must also maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of for the twelve months ending march   which gradually increases to for the twelve months ending november  in addition  we must maintain a minimum fixed charge ratio of for the twelve months ending march   gradually increasing to for the twelve months ending august  capital expenditures are limited to million annually beginning with the twelve months ended march  these capital expenditure limits are subject to upward adjustment based upon availability of excess liquidity as defined in our senior secured credit facility and unused amounts from the prior fiscal year 
we may also use amounts permitted for capital expenditures to make optional purchases of our publicly traded debt 
we were in compliance with the covenants of the senior secured credit facility  as amended  and our other credit facilities and debt instruments as of march  with continuing improvements in operating performance  we anticipate that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
however  variations in our operating performance and unanticipated developments may adversely affect our ability to remain in compliance with the applicable debt covenants 
the senior secured credit facility provides for customary events of default  including nonpayment  misrepresentation  breach of covenants and bankruptcy 
it is also an event of default if any event occurs that enables  or which with the giving of notice or the lapse of time would enable  the holder of our debt to accelerate the maturity of debt having a principal amount of million or more 
refinancing on june   we completed a major refinancing that extended the maturity dates of the majority of our debt to or beyond  provided additional equity  converted a portion of our debt to equity and reclassified capital leases to operating leases 
the components of the refinancing are described in detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
major components of the refinancing are summarized below new secured credit facility we entered into a new billion syndicated senior secured credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by citicorp usa  inc as senior agent 
the new facility matures on june  unless more than million of our senior notes due april  are outstanding on december   in which event the maturity date is march  the new facility consists of a billion term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility 
the term loan was used to prepay various outstanding debt balances 
high yield notes we issued million of senior notes due july these notes are unsecured and are effectively subordinate to our secured debt 
debt for debt exchange we exchanged million of our existing senior secured notes for an equal principal amount of senior secured notes due september  the notes are secured by a second priority lien on the collateral of the senior secured credit facility 
in addition  holders of these notes received warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at per share 
on june   the warrant holders elected to exercise these warrants  on a cashless basis  and as a result million shares of common stock were issued 
tender offer on may   we commenced a tender offer for the senior secured notes due at a price of of the principal amount 
the tender offer was closed on june   at which time million principal was tendered 
we incurred a tender offer premium of million as a result of the transaction 
we used proceeds from the new senior secured credit facility to pay for the tender offer 
debt for equity exchanges we completed exchanges of million of debt for million shares of common stock 
sales of common stock we issued million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
lease obligations we relinquished certain renewal options which had been available under the terms of certain real estate leases on property previously sold and leased back and accordingly  we reclassified the related leases as operating leases thereby reducing outstanding capital lease obligations by million 
impact on results of operations for fiscal as a result of the refinancing  we i recorded an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt of million  ii recognized a loss of million related to debt and lease conversions and modifications  and iii recognized a charge of million related to our interest rate swap agreements 
other transactions convertible notes we issued million of our convertible notes due december in november these notes were issued at a discount resulting in cash proceeds of million 
these notes are unsecured and are effectively subordinate to our secured debt 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustments to prevent dilution  at any time 
retirement and repurchases of debt we retired million of our convertible subordinated notes due and million of our senior secured notes due at maturity in fiscal in addition  we repurchased million of our dealer remarketable securities  million of our fixed rate senior notes due and million of our notes due we repurchased million of our dealer remarketable securities due  million of our notes due and million of our convertible subordinated notes due during fiscal other debt maturities and other obligations the following table details the maturities of our indebtedness and lease financing obligations as of march   as well as other contractual cash obligations and commitments  without giving effect to the senior secured notes issued in april or the completion of a new senior secured credit facility before the end of may contractual obligations and commitment

we lease certain distribution facilities under a synthetic lease agreement 
the agreement is accounted for as an operating lease and the related operating lease payments are included in the above table 
these properties will be repurchased upon expected completion of the new senior secured credit facility in may at that time  we expect that the synthetic lease will be terminated for approximately million 
our guaranteed residual obligation of million under the agreement is included in the table above in lease guarantees 
net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities cash provided by operations was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  income tax refunds of million and decreases in accounts receivable and inventory  which more than offset million in interest payments and a decrease in accounts payable 
cash provided by operations was million in fiscal cash was provided primarily through improved operating results  a significant reduction in interest payments and a reduction in inventory levels net of a decrease in accounts payable 
we used million of cash to fund continuing operations in fiscal operating cash flow was negatively impacted by million of interest payments 
operating cash flow was also negatively impacted from an increase in current assets  primarily resulting from repurchasing million of accounts receivable when we refinanced the accounts receivable securitization facility and a decrease in accounts payable and other liabilities 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal cash of million was used for the purchase of fixed assets and cash of million was used for the purchase of prescription files 
cash of million was provided by the disposition of fixed assets and other investments 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal cash was provided from the sale of our investment in advancepcs  less expenditures for fixed assets and prescription file purchases 
cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal cash was provided from the sale of our discontinued operations  less expenditures for fixed assets and prescription file purchases 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal the cash used consisted of the repayments of long term debt and deferred financing fees  offset with proceeds from the issuance of bonds 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the cash used consisted of repayments of long term debt of billion and payments of deferred financing costs of million  offset with new borrowing of billion  bond proceeds of million and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal the cash used consisted of payments of million of deferred financing costs partially offset by net debt borrowings of million and proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of million 
during fiscal  we used the proceeds from the sale of our pbm segment to reduce our borrowings 
capital expenditures we plan to make total capital expenditures of approximately million during fiscal  consisting of approximately million related to new store construction  store relocation and store remodel projects 
an additional million will be dedicated to the purchase of prescription files from independent pharmacists and technology enhancements  with the remaining million dedicated to improvements to distribution centers and other corporate requirements 
management expects that these capital expenditures will be financed primarily with cash flow from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility available under our senior secured facility 
future liquidity we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness i limits our ability to obtain additional financing  ii limits our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  iii places us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less debt  iv renders us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and v requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
based upon current levels of operations and planned improvements in our operating performance  management believes that cash flow from operations together with available borrowings under the senior secured credit facility and other sources of liquidity will be adequate to meet our anticipated annual requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
we will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in light of our operating performance and other relevant circumstances 
should we determine  at any time  that it is necessary to obtain additional short term liquidity  we will evaluate our alternatives and take appropriate steps to obtain sufficient additional funds 
obtaining any such supplemental liquidity through the increase of indebtedness or asset sales may require the consent of the lenders under one or more of our debt agreements 
there can be no assurance that any such supplemental funding  if sought  could be obtained or that our lenders would provide the necessary consents  if required 
recent accounting pronouncements we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective march  sfas no 
specifies that all goodwill and indefinite life intangibles shall no longer be amortized 
goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and evaluated for impairment on an annual basis with an initial impairment assessment to be performed upon adoption of sfas no 
we completed the transitional assessment as of march   and determined that there was no impairment loss to be recognized upon adoption of sfas no 
impairment is reassessed on an annual basis 
we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets effective march  sfas no 
addressed the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

are required to be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified

 which are effective for financial statements issued on or after may   have been adopted without material impact 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
this differs from the guidance in eitf  which requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit plan or disposal activity be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also requires all charges related to an exit activity  including accretion of interest related to the discounting of the future liability related to that activity  to be classified in the same line item on the statement of operations 
the provisions of the statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we have adopted sfas no 
effective january  this adoption impacts the timing of recognition of liabilities for exit or severance plans committed to after the adoption date  but has no impact on liabilities recorded by the company for exit or severance costs as of december  effective january   we record accretion of interest related to the discounting of the future liability related to that activity as a component of store closing and impairment charges on the statement of operations 
in september  eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor was issued 
the pronouncement addresses two issues 
the first issue requires that vendor consideration received by a reseller be characterized as a reduction of cost of sales unless the consideration is either i a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor  in which case the consideration should be characterized as revenue or ii a reimbursement of costs incurred to sell the vendor s products  in which case  the consideration should be characterized as a reduction of that cost 
the requirements for this issue are to be applied to new arrangements  including modifications of existing arrangements  entered into after december  the second issue requires that rebates or refunds payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified period of time should be recognized as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation over the purchase period provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
this portion of the pronouncement is to be applied to all new arrangements initiated after november  the adoption of this pronouncement had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported interim and annual results 
as of march   we have elected to continue accounting for stock based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
in november of  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements of guarantees including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires entities to establish liabilities for certain types of guarantees and expands financial statement disclosures for others 
the accounting requirements of fin no 
are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the adoption of fin no 
did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin no 
in january of  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires the consolidation of entities that cannot finance their activities without the support of other parties and that lack certain characteristics of a controlling interest  such as the ability to make decisions about the entity s activities via voting rights or similar rights 
the entity that consolidates the variable interest entity is the primary beneficiary of the entity s activities 
fin no 
applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and must be applied in the first period beginning after june  for entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest entity that it acquired before february  we plan to adopt this interpretation in the third quarter of fiscal upon adoption  without regard to the outcome of the announced intention to replace the existing senior secured credit facility and related activities  we will capitalize our existing synthetic lease  which will increase our fixed assets and debt balances 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for uncollectible receivables  inventory shrink  impairment  self insurance liabilities  pension benefits  lease exit liabilities  income taxes and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current and anticipated business conditions  the condition of the financial markets and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under existing conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements allowance for uncollectible receivables the majority of our prescription sales are made to customers that are covered by third party payors  such as insurance companies  government agencies and employers 
we carry receivables that represent the amount owed to us for sales made to customers or employees of those payors that have not yet been paid 
we maintain a reserve for the amount of these receivables deemed to be uncollectible 
this reserve is calculated based upon historical collection activity adjusted for current conditions 
if the financial condition of the payors were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  then an additional reserve would be required 
inventory included in our valuation of inventory are estimates of the losses related to shrink  which occurs during periods between physical inventory counts 
when estimating these losses  we consider historical loss results at specific locations as well as overall loss trends 
should actual shrink losses differ from the estimates that our reserves are based on  our operating results will be impacted 
impairment we evaluate long lived assets  including stores and excluding goodwill  for impairment annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may not be recoverable 
the impairment is measured by calculating the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the store  and comparing this amount to the carrying value of the store s assets 
cash flows are calculated utilizing individual store forecasts and total company projections for the remaining estimated lease lives of the stores being analyzed 
should actual results differ from those forecasted and projected  we are subject to future impairment charges related to these facilities 
goodwill impairment as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements  we have unamortized goodwill in the amount of million 
in connection with the provisions of sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment test of goodwill 
our test as of march   resulted in no impairment being identified 
however  the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of our company 
inherent in such fair value determinations are certain judgements and estimates  including the interpretation of economic indicators and market valuations and assumptions about our strategic plans 
to the extent that our strategic plans change  or that economic and market conditions worsen  it is possible that our conclusion regarding goodwill impairment could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
self insurance liabilities we record estimates for self insured medical  dental  worker s compensation and general liability insurance coverage 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
benefit plan accrual we have several defined benefit plans  under which participants earn a retirement benefit based upon a formula set forth in the plan 
we record expense related to these plans using actuarially determined amounts that are calculated under the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of increase in future compensation levels 
these rates are based on market interest rates  and therefore fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
lease exit liabilities we record reserves for closed stores based on future lease commitments  anticipated ancillary occupancy costs  anticipated future subleases of properties and current risk free interest rates 
if interest rates or real estate leasing markets change  reserves may be increased or decreased 
income taxes we currently have net operating loss nol carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes 
these nols generate a significant deferred tax asset 
however  we have recorded a valuation allowance against this deferred tax asset as we have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not be able to fully utilize the nols 
should our assumptions regarding the utilization of these nols change  we may reduce some or all of this valuation allowance  which would result in the recording of an income tax benefit 
litigation reserves we are involved in litigation on an on going basis 
we accrue our best estimate of the probable loss related to legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with in house and outside counsel  and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our best estimate of the probable liability may also change 
factors affecting our future prospects risks related to our financial condition we are highly leveraged 
our substantial indebtedness will severely limit cash flow available for our operations and could adversely affect our ability to service debt or obtain additional financing if necessary 
we had  as of march   billion of outstanding indebtedness and stockholders deficit of million 
we also had additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility of million at that time without giving effect to a million reduction in our borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility in connection with our april offering of our senior secured notes  net of outstanding letters of credit of million 
our debt obligations adversely affect our operations in a number of ways and while we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital  debt service and capital expenditures through fiscal year  there can be no assurance that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt  which may require us to borrow additional funds for that purpose  restructure or otherwise refinance our debt 
our earnings were insufficient to cover our fixed charges for fiscal by million 
it was also necessary for us to supplement our cash from operations with borrowings under our senior secured credit facility for fiscal and our high level of indebtedness will continue to restrict our operations 
among other things  our indebtedness will limit our ability to obtain additional financing  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the markets in which we compete  place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness  render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions  and require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service our debt 
our ability to make payments on our debt depends upon our ability to substantially improve our future operating performance  which is subject to general economic and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which we cannot control 
if our cash flow from our operating activities is insufficient  we may take certain actions  including delaying or reducing capital or other expenditures  attempting to restructure or refinance our debt  selling assets or operations or seeking additional equity capital 
we may be unable to take any of these actions on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner 
further  any of these actions may not be sufficient to allow us to service our debt obligations or may have an adverse impact on our business 
our existing debt agreements limit our ability to take certain of these actions 
our failure to earn enough to pay our debts or to successfully undertake any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on us 
a substantial amount of our indebtedness  including the debt outstanding under our senior secured credit facility  will mature in if we do not enter into our proposed new senior secured credit facility 
some of our debt  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  is based upon variable rates of interest  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
approximately billion of our outstanding indebtedness excluding our synthetic lease and without giving effect to our repayment of million of the term loan under our senior secured credit facility in connection with our april offering of our senior secured notes as of march  bears an interest rate that varies depending upon libor 
if we borrow additional amounts under our senior credit facility  the interest rate on those borrowings will vary depending upon libor 
if libor rises  the interest rates on this outstanding debt will also increase 
therefore an increase in libor would increase our interest payment obligations under these outstanding loans and have a negative effect on our cash flow and financial condition 
the covenants in our outstanding indebtedness impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
the covenants in the instruments that govern our outstanding indebtedness restrict our ability to incur liens and debt  pay dividends  make redemptions and repurchases of capital stock  make loans  investments and capital expenditures  prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  engage in mergers  consolidations  assets dispositions  sale leaseback transactions and affiliate transactions  change our business  amend certain debt and other material agreements  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  restrict distributions from subsidiaries  and grant negative pledges to other creditors 
we would expect our proposed new credit facility to include similar covenants 
moreover  if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants  a default could result under one or more of these agreements 
a default  if not waived by our lenders  could result in the acceleration of our outstanding indebtedness and cause our debt to become immediately due and payable 
if acceleration occurs  we would not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt 
even if new financing is made available to us  it may not be available on terms acceptable to us 
if we obtain modifications of our agreements  or are required to obtain waivers of defaults  we may incur significant fees and transaction costs 
in fiscal  as well as in fiscal and  we modified certain covenants contained in our senior secured credit facility and loan agreements 
in fiscal  we obtained waivers of compliance contained in our credit facilities and public indentures 
in connection with obtaining these modifications and waivers  we paid significant fees and transaction costs 
risks related to our operations major lawsuits have been brought against us and certain of our subsidiaries  and there are currently pending both civil and criminal investigations by the united states attorney 
in addition to any fines or damages that we might have to pay  any criminal conviction against us may result in the loss of licenses and contracts that are material to the conduct of our business  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
there are several major ongoing lawsuits and investigations in which we are involved 
while some of these lawsuits have been settled  pending court approval or appeal  we are unable to predict the outcome of any of these matters at this time 
if any of these cases result in a substantial monetary judgment against us or are settled on unfavorable terms  our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
there are currently pending both civil and criminal governmental investigations by the united states attorney concerning our operations under prior management and other matters 
settlement discussions have begun with the united states attorney of the middle district of pennsylvania  who has proposed that the government would not institute any criminal proceeding against us if we enter into a consent judgment providing for a civil penalty payable over a period of years 
the amount of the civil penalty has not been agreed to and there can be no assurance that a settlement will be reached or that the amount of such penalty will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we have recorded an accrual of million in fiscal in connection with the resolution of these matters  however  we may incur charges in excess of that amount and we are unable to estimate the possible range of loss 
we will continue to evaluate our estimate and to the extent that additional information arises or our strategy changes  we will adjust our accrual accordingly 
if we were convicted of any crime  certain licenses and government contracts  such as medicaid plan reimbursement agreements  that are material to our operations may be revoked  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  substantial penalties  damages or other monetary remedies assessed against us could also have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
given the size and nature of our business  we are subject from time to time to various lawsuits which  depending on their outcome  may have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we are substantially dependent on a single supplier of pharmaceutical products to sell products to us on satisfactory terms 
a disruption in this relationship would have a negative effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
we obtain approximately of our pharmaceutical products from a single supplier  mckesson  pursuant to a contract that runs until april pharmacy sales represented approximately of our total sales during fiscal  and  therefore  our relationship with mckesson is important to us 
any significant disruptions in our relationship with mckesson would make it difficult for us to continue to operate our business  and would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we need to continue to improve our operations in order to improve our financial condition  but our operations will not improve if we cannot continue to effectively implement our business strategy or if our strategy is negatively affected by general economic conditions 
our operations during fiscal were adversely affected by a number of factors  including our financial difficulties  inventory shortages  allegations of violations of the law  including drug pricing issues  disputes with suppliers and uncertainties regarding our ability to produce audited financial statements 
to improve operations  new management developed  and in fiscal began implementing and continues to implement  a business strategy to improve our stores and enhance our relationships with our customers by improving the pricing of products  providing more consistent advertising through weekly circulars  eliminating inventory shortages and out dated inventory  strengthening our relationships with our vendors  developing programs intended to provide better customer service  purchasing prescription files and other means 
since the beginning of fiscal  we have relocated stores  remodeled stores  opened stores and closed or sold an additional  stores 
these new  relocated and remodeled stores represented approximately of our total stores at march  
although this substantial investment made in our store base over the last seven years has given us a modern store base  our store base has not yet achieved a level of sales productivity comparable to our major competitors 
accordingly  many of our new and relocated stores have not developed a critical mass of customers needed to achieve profitability 
our strategy is to focus on improving the productivity of our existing store base 
we believe that improving the sales of existing stores is important to achieving profitability and continuing to improve operating cash flow 
if we are not successful in implementing our strategy  or if our strategy is not effective  we may not be able to continue to improve our operations 
in addition  any adverse change in general economic conditions can adversely effect consumer buying practices and reduce our sales of front end products  which are our higher margin products  and cause a proportionately greater decrease in our profitability 
failure to continue to improve operations or a decline in general economic conditions would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows and our ability to make principal or interest payments on our debt 
we are dependent on our management team  and the loss of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business and the results of our operations or financial condition 
the success of our business is materially dependent upon the continued services of our executive management team 
the loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations  financial condition or cash flows 
additionally  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future 
on april  we announced that mary f

miller  currently our chairman and chief executive officer  will retain the position of chairman 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other attacks or acts of war may adversely affect the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
the attacks of september  and subsequent events  including the current military action in iraq  have caused instability in the united states and other financial markets and have led  and may continue to lead  to further armed hostilities  prolonged military action in iraq or further acts of terrorism in the united states or abroad  which could cause further instability in financial markets and reduced consumer confidence 
the threat of terrorist attacks  the current military action in iraq and other related developments may adversely affect prevailing economic conditions  resulting in reduced consumer spending and reduced sales in our stores 
these developments will subject us to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our industry the markets in which we operate are very competitive and further increases in competition could adversely affect us 
we face intense competition with local  regional and national companies  including other drugstore chains  independently owned drugstores  supermarkets  mass merchandisers  discount stores and mail order pharmacies 
we may not be able to effectively compete against them because our existing or potential competitors may have financial and other resources that are superior to ours 
in addition  we may be at a competitive disadvantage because we are more highly leveraged than our competitors 
because many of our stores are new  their ability to achieve profitability depends on their ability to achieve a critical mass of customers 
while customer growth is often achieved through purchases of prescription files from existing pharmacies  our ability to achieve this critical mass through purchases of prescription files could be confined by liquidity constraints 
although in the recent past  our competitiveness has been adversely affected by problems with inventory shortages  uncompetitive pricing and customer service  we have taken steps to address these issues 
we believe that the continued consolidation of the drugstore industry and additional store openings will further increase competitive pressures in the industry 
as competition increases  a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur  which would require us to increase our sales volume and to sell higher margin products and services in order to remain competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue effectively to compete in our markets or increase our sales volume in response to further increased competition 
changes in third party reimbursement levels for prescription drugs could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business 
sales of prescription drugs  as a percentage of sales  and the percentage of prescription sales with third parties  have been increasing and we expect them to continue to increase 
in fiscal  sales of prescription drugs represented of our sales and of all of the prescription drugs that we sold were with third party payors 
during fiscal  the top five third party payors accounted for approximately of our total sales 
any significant loss of third party provider business could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
also  these third party payors could reduce the levels at which they will reimburse us for the prescription drugs that we provide to their members 
furthermore  if medicare is reformed to include prescription benefits  we may be reimbursed for some prescription drugs at prices lower than our current reimbursement levels 
in fiscal  approximately of our revenues were from state sponsored medicaid agencies 
there have been a number of recent proposals and enactments by various states to reduce medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget problems  some of which propose to reduce reimbursement levels in the applicable states significantly  and we expect other similar proposals in the future 
if third party payors reduce their reimbursement levels or if medicare covers prescription drugs at reimbursement levels lower than our current retail prices  our margins on these sales would be reduced  and the profitability of our business and our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
we are subject to governmental regulations  procedures and requirements  our noncompliance or a significant regulatory change could adversely affect our business  the results of our operations or our financial condition 
our pharmacy business is subject to federal  state and local regulation 
these include local registrations of pharmacies in the states where our pharmacies are located  applicable medicare and medicaid regulations and prohibitions against paid referrals of patients 
failure to properly adhere to these and other applicable regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties and could adversely affect the continued operation of our business 
furthermore  our pharmacies could be affected by federal and state reform programs  such as healthcare reform initiatives which could  in turn  negatively affect our business 
the passing of these initiatives or any new federal or state programs could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
our pharmacy business is subject to the patient privacy and other obligations including corporate  pharmacy and associate responsibility  imposed by the health insurance portability and accountability act 
as a covered entity  we are required to implement privacy standards  train our associates on the permitted use and disclosures of protected health information  provide a notice of privacy practice to our pharmacy customers and permit pharmacy health customers to access and amend their records and receive an accounting of disclosures of protected health information 
failure to properly adhere to these requirements could result in the imposition of civil as well as criminal penalties 
certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services  our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us 
pharmacies are exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  such as with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings 
although we maintain professional liability and errors and omissions liability insurance  from time to time  claims result in the payment of significant amounts  some portions of which are not funded by insurance 
we can offer no assurance that the coverage limits under our insurance programs will be adequate to protect us against future claims  or that we will maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows may be adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable or there is an increase in liability for which we self insure or we suffer reputational harm as a result of an error or omission 
we will not be able to compete effectively if we are unable to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
there is a nationwide shortage of qualified pharmacists 
in response  we have implemented improved benefits and training programs in order to attract  hire and retain qualified pharmacists 
however  we may not be able to attract  hire and retain enough qualified pharmacists 
this could adversely affect our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our future earnings  cash flow and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market rates 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense 
we enter into debt obligations to support capital expenditures  acquisitions  working capital needs and general corporate purposes

our ability to satisfy our interest payment obligations on our outstanding debt will depend largely on our future performance  which  in turn  is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors beyond our control 
if we do not have sufficient cash flow to service our interest payment obligations on our outstanding indebtedness and if we cannot borrow or obtain equity financing to satisfy those obligations  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we cannot be assured that any replacement borrowing or equity financing could be successfully completed 
the ratings on the senior credit facility as of april  were bb by standard poor s and b by moody s 
the interest rate on the variable rate borrowings under the senior credit facility as of april  is libor plus 
downgrades of our credit ratings could have an impact upon the rate on the borrowings under these credit facilities 
changes in one month libor affect our cost of borrowings because the interest rate on our variable rate obligations is based on libor 
if the market rates of interest for one month libor change by approximately basis points as compared to the libor rate of as of march  our annual interest expense would change by approximately million based upon our variable rate debt outstanding of approximately  million on march  a change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed rate debt instruments 
as fixed rate debt matures  however  and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment  future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates 
this effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures
