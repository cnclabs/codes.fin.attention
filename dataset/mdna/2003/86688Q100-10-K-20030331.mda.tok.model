the balance of funds are available for general corporate purposes 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
funds required for the retirement of the senior subordinated notes  including related premiums and accrued interest  were held in trust at december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  investments  goodwill  intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances in making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we hold minority interests in both publicly traded and privately held companies 
some of the publicly traded companies have highly volatile share prices 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 

table of contents we have significant goodwill recorded in our accounts 
certain of our newspapers operate in highly competitive markets 
we are required to determine annually whether or not there has been any permanent impairment in the value of these assets 
changes in long term readership patterns and advertising expenditures may affect the value and necessitate an impairment charge 
certain indicators of potential impairment that could impact the company s reporting units include  but are not limited to  the following i a significant long term adverse change in the business climate that is expected to cause a substantial decline in advertising spending  ii a permanent significant decline in a reporting unit s newspaper readership  iii a significant adverse long term negative change in the demographics of a reporting unit s newspaper readership and iv a significant technological change that results in a substantially more cost effective method of advertising than newspapers 
the company sponsors several defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans for domestic and foreign employees 
these defined benefit plans include pension and post retirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
in determining these obligations and related expenses  key assumptions are made concerning expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions the company evaluated  among other things  input from actuaries  expected long term market returns and current high quality bond rates 
the company will continue to evaluate the expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized by the company over a period of approximately years  which represents the weighted average remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience  assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  the company had unrecognized net actuarial losses of million 
these unrecognized amounts could result in an increase to pension expenses in future years depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at december   and as a result of the negative impact that declines in global capital markets and interest rates had on the assets and obligations of the company s pension plans 
accordingly  a non cash charge of million  after tax and minority interest  was recorded in other comprehensive loss for the minimum pension liability 
the charge was million million after tax in and million with no tax impact in similar charges may be required in future years as the impact of changes in global capital markets and interest rates on the value of our pension plan assets and obligations is measured 
during  the company made contributions of million to the defined benefit plans 
global capital market and interest rate fluctuations could impact future funding requirements for such plans 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional company contributions may be required 
if the company is required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be adversely affected  and the company s cash flow available for other uses may be reduced 
results of operations for the years ended december   and restatement in connection with the sale of assets to canwest in  the company recorded a valuation allowance of million against the remaining pension plan asset in respect of the operations sold 
recent regulatory guidance has precluded the use of a valuation allowance under us gaap 
accordingly  the company has reversed the valuation allowance established in fiscal  which has resulted in an increase in the reported gain on sale of properties included in other expense in fiscal of million and a decrease in the reported compensation costs and operating loss for fiscal of million 
overall  this retroactive restatement had the impact of increasing the company s net earnings for fiscal by million net of additional income tax expense of million and decreasing its reported net loss for fiscal by million net of additional income tax expense of million and minority interest of million 
as a result of the restatement  deferred income tax liabilities increased by million and million in and respectively  minority interest increased by million in  total assets have increased by million and million in and respectively  pension liabilities have decreased by million in and cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment has decreased by million in and increased by million in the results of operations and net earnings loss for the company and the canadian newspaper group for fiscal and have been adjusted from amounts previously reported to give effect to the restatement noted above

net loss 
we had a net loss of million in compared with a net loss of million in the net losses in and included a large number of infrequent and unusual items as well as an extraordinary item and an adjustment to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
infrequent items are disclosed separately in our consolidated statements of operations and unusual items are primarily included in other income expense 
operating income loss 
operating income in was million compared with an operating loss of million in  an increase of million 
the increase in operating income was primarily due to the disposition of the company s remaining interest in the national post in august  lower consumption of and prices for newsprint throughout the year  reduced compensation costs  lower operating costs in general  reduced amortization charges largely as a consequence of the adoption of sfas no 
and fewer infrequent items 
operating revenues 
operating revenues were  million in compared with  million in  a decrease of million 
the overall decrease in revenue is primarily due to the sale of most of our remaining canadian newspapers in july and november to osprey media  the sale of our remaining interest in the national post in august and a soft advertising environment  particularly in the united kingdom 
favorable changes in the exchange rate with the british pound helped mitigate revenue declines at the telegraph 
operating expenses 
total operating costs and expenses were million in compared with  million in  a decrease of million 
newsprint expense was million in compared with million in  a decrease of million or 
the decrease was primarily due to lower consumption at the uk newspaper group  the sales of canadian newspaper properties in and declining newsprint prices 
average newsprint prices at both the uk newspaper group and chicago group year over year were lower 
compensation costs were million in  a year over year decrease of 
table of contents million or 
other operating costs of million in decreased year over year by million or

infrequent items in amounted to million compared with million in infrequent items in included a one time expense related to a pension and post retirement plan liability adjustment of million as well as duplicated costs resulting from operating two printing plants during start up of the new plant in chicago 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease is largely a consequence of the retirement of a portion of long term debt in and a partial repayment of the company s senior notes in march the source of the cash for repayment was the sale of the participation interests in the canwest debentures in interest and dividend income 
interest and dividend income in was million compared with million in  a decrease of million 
interest and dividend income in included interest on the canwest debentures until the sale of participation interests in august and december  interest on the remaining canwest debentures  dividends on canwest shares and bank interest on the significant cash balance primarily accumulated from the proceeds of the sale in of canadian newspaper properties and the sales of canwest shares and participations in canwest debentures 
most of the proceeds from the disposal of the canwest investments were retained as short term investments at low rates of interest until march when a portion of the company s long term debt was retired 
foreign currency losses  net 
foreign currency losses in were million compared with million in the loss principally consisted of a million loss incurred as a result of the substantial liquidation of our investment in the canadian newspaper group and the related repatriation of funds to the united states 
prior to this year  the cumulative foreign exchange losses associated with our canadian investment were included in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
other income expense  net 
other expense in of million included charges in respect of writedowns of investments of million and a loss of million relating to the total return equity swaps

income taxes 
income tax expense in was million compared with a recovery of million in effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate differed from the us federal income tax rate primarily because of non deductible foreign exchange losses with an impact of million on taxes and the recording of a valuation allowance in respect of canadian deferred tax assets of million 
for  differences from the us federal income tax rate were attributable to non deductible expenses of million  differences between tax gains and losses and book gains and losses of million and individual company losses not tax effected of million 
minority interest 
minority interest in was million 
minority interest in was a recovery of million 
the recovery in results primarily from the minority s share of national post losses to august  offset by the minority s share of earnings of hollinger lp extraordinary item 
the extraordinary item of million represents the after tax cost of retiring a portion of the company s long term debt in march including premiums payable on early redemption and the write off of deferred financing charges 
change in accounting principle 
the transitional provision of sfas no 
required the company to assess whether goodwill is impaired as of january  the fair values of the company s reporting units are determined primarily using a multiple of maintainable normalized cash earnings 
as a result of this transitional impairment test  and based on the methodology adopted  the company has determined that the carrying amount of the jerusalem post properties is in excess of its estimated fair value 
accordingly  the value of goodwill attributable to the jerusalem post has been written down in its entirety 
the write down of million net of tax of nil has been reflected in the consolidated statement of operations as of january  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the company has determined that the fair value of all other reporting units is in excess of the 
table of contents respective carrying amount  both on adoption and at year end for purposes of the annual impairment test

total operating costs and expenses were million  a decrease of million or from million in cost savings were achieved across the board with reductions in compensation costs of million to million  in newsprint costs of million to million and in other operating costs of million to million 
reductions in compensation and other costs are the consequence of cost management initiatives undertaken during the course of and newsprint cost reductions are the consequence of commodity price decreases as well as reductions in per copy consumption

operating income showed a substantial improvement of million to million in from million in with operating profit margin increasing to from 
operating income continued to be affected by the decline in advertising revenue which started in and has continued through exchange rates had a favorable impact in  however  with the average exchange rate of pounds sterling into us dollars improving from in to in 
table of contents canadian newspaper group operating revenues were million in and million in  a decline of million 
the primary reason for the decline is the sale of our remaining in the national post to canwest at the end of august and the sale of a large number of our canadian community newspaper properties to osprey media in july and november of beyond that  advertising revenues at operations owned in both years declined during the year  particularly for the magazine group

table of contents liquidity and capital resources working capital 
working capital consists of current assets less current liabilities 
at december   working capital  excluding debt obligations and related funds held in escrow  was a deficiency of million compared to working capital of million at december  the reduction in working capital is primarily the result of the application of cash and cash equivalents to repay or retire indebtedness outstanding at december  during the year ended december   approximately million of cash and cash equivalents were used to retire some of the company s long term debt which included both principal repayment and related early retirement premiums 
an additional million was paid to redeem the balance of the total return equity swaps outstanding 
included in income taxes payable are income taxes of approximately million that have been provided on gains on sales of assets computed on tax bases that result in higher gains for tax purposes than for accounting purposes 
strategies have been and may be implemented that may also defer and or reduce these taxes but the effects of these strategies have not been reflected in the accounts 
while the timing of the payment of such income taxes  if any  is uncertain  the company does not expect any significant amount to be paid in fiscal in december  the company sold senior notes for net proceeds of million and drew down million net of fees pursuant to the senior credit facility 
of those proceeds  million was held in escrow in short term investments at december  for the purpose of redeeming the company s senior subordinated notes due in and  including the payment of the related redemption premiums and accrued interest 
the related debt of million is reflected as a current liability at december  the senior subordinated notes were redeemed in january at december   the company held million in escrow  million of which related to the total return equity swaps and was held as further collateral for the company s obligations 
we are an international holding company and our assets consist solely of investments in our subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
as a result  our ability to meet our future financial obligations is dependent upon the availability of cash flows from our united states and foreign subsidiaries through dividends  intercompany advances  management fees and other payments 
similarly  our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited as a result of our dependence upon the distribution of earnings of our subsidiaries and affiliated companies 
our subsidiaries and affiliated companies are under no obligation to pay dividends and  in the case of publishing and its principal united states and foreign subsidiaries  are subject to statutory restrictions and restrictions in debt agreements that limit their ability to pay dividends 
substantially all of the shares of our subsidiaries have been pledged to our lenders 
our right to participate in the distribution of assets of any subsidiary or affiliated company upon its liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of the creditors of such subsidiary or affiliated company  including trade creditors  except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against such subsidiary or affiliated company 
cash flows 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended december  compared with cash flows used in of million and provided in of million 
improvements in operating income accounted for the largest portion of the increase in operating cash flows in the cash flows used in operating activities in were adversely affected in relation to by decreased operating income in turn largely as a consequence of asset dispositions and the receipt of interest income in from the canwest debentures as payments in kind rather than cash 
cash flows used in investing activities in were million  a decrease of million from million provided by investing activities in asset sales excluding plant and equipment in were negligible whereas in  we realized proceeds on the sale of participations in the canwest debentures and from the disposition of various community and french language newspapers  chiefly in canada 
cash flows from investing activities in of  million reflect principally the sale of canadian newspaper properties to canwest and sales of a number of community papers in the us these inflows were partially offset by expenditures for the acquisition of newspapers in the chicago area  capital expenditures and additions to investments 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in as opposed to million in use of cash in was directed towards the retirement of our senior notes early in the year and the retirement of total return equity swap obligations later in the year 
borrowings of million under our senior credit facility and the placement of the senior notes of million before costs of million were used to retire the total return equity swap obligations and our facility from trilon in december and our senior subordinated notes in their entirety in january the remaining proceeds are available for general corporate purposes 
at december   million held in trust to retire our senior subordinated notes including related redemption premiums and accrued interest has not been included in cash 
cash flows used in operating activities in have been reduced by million from that previously reported to reflect a similar classification of escrow funds held at december  
table of contents those funds were transferred to various banks as further collateral in support of our total return equity swap obligations and in support of a bank credit facility 
cash of million used in for financing activities was applied to the payment of dividends and the purchase for cancellation of class a common stock from a bank in connection with total return equity swap obligations and from hollinger inc 
cash used for financing activities of  million in primarily reflects the repayment of debt  the redemption of hcph special shares and dividend payments 
we anticipate no major dispositions in although we continue to encourage reasonable offers for the balance of our canadian operations 
with the completion of long term financing arrangements and anticipated improvements in operating income as a consequence of efforts to manage costs  we expect to see cash flow from operations improve 
any significant upward movement in newsprint prices would adversely affect that outlook 
as long as the advertising market remains in a downturn  cash flows from operations will not recover to satisfactory levels 
we believe  however  that at current levels of economic activity and with our current cost structure  cash flow provided by operations of our subsidiaries will be sufficient to meet future cash requirements including capital expenditures 
there is no assurance that any excess cash flow generated by our subsidiaries could be distributed to the company 
as of march   the company believes it has sufficient cash on hand to meet its anticipated cash obligations for the balance of capital expenditures and acquisition financing 
in the past three years the chicago group  the community group  the uk newspaper group and the canadian newspaper group have funded their capital expenditures and acquisition and investment activities out of cash provided by their respective operating activities and  in  through borrowings under their bank credit facilities 
in  the company may invest up to million in capital expenditures primarily through available cash flow

we  together with publishing and its principal subsidiaries  are parties to various debt agreements that have been entered into to replace past financing  address working capital requirements and for other corporate purposes 
at december   our indebtedness was  million 
of that amount  million was repaid in january from funds held in escrow at december  on december   certain of our subsidiaries entered into a new million senior credit facility with a group of financial institutions arranged by wachovia securities  inc  as described in item business bank credit facility

that sale of participation interests was supplemented by a further sale of cdn million us million in december we remain the record owner of the participated canwest debentures and are required to make payments to the participation trust with respect to those debentures if and to the extent we receive payment in cash or kind on the debentures from canwest 
coincident with the participation trust s purchase of the participation interests  the participation trust sold senior notes to arm s length third parties to finance the purchase of the participation interest 
these transactions resulted in net proceeds to the company of million and for accounting purposes have been accounted for as sales in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the net loss on the transactions  including realized holding losses on the debentures  amounted to million and has been included in other income expense  net for the year ended december  we believe that the participation arrangement does not constitute a prohibited sale of debentures as legal title was not transferred 
canwest has advised us that it accepts that position 
at any time up to november   canwest may elect to pay interest on the debentures by way of additional canwest debentures or through the issuance of non voting common shares of canwest 
further  at any time after may   the holders of the participation trust senior notes may  under the terms of the participation trust  elect to convert their notes into the canwest debentures 
should the noteholders so elect  we would be required to transfer to the participation trust sufficient canwest debentures at exchange rates then in effect to allow full conversion of the senior notes

the swaps are cross currency floating to fixed rate swaps from usd libor to sterling fixed rate at a blended rate of 
the swaps were purchased to take advantage of low rates on this type of instrument and to provide certainty on interest charges to the operations of the uk newspaper group in a time of soft advertising sales

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk newsprint 
on a consolidated basis  newsprint expense for the years ended december  and amounted to million and million respectively 
management believes that newsprint prices may vary widely from time to time and could continue to show significant price variations in the future 
during the first half of  newsprint prices in north america were at 
table of contents their highest price per ton since and however  the recessional climate in caused a significant decline in industry consumption and this  coupled with an abundant supply of competitively priced newsprint  resulted in a downward trend in prices during the second half of this downward trend continued into  however there are indications that prices on the spot market where the chicago group purchases its newsprint may moderately increase from their current levels 
in the united kingdom  average newsprint prices were less than the average prices paid in in the united kingdom  the company negotiates prices for one year periods 
rates negotiated for are about lower than those for operating divisions take steps to ensure that they have sufficient supply of newsprint and have mitigated cost increases by adjusting pagination and page sizes and printing and distributing practices 
based on levels of usage  during the year ended december   a change in the price of newsprint of per ton would increase or decrease year to date net income by approximately million 
interest rates 
the company has borrowed million under its senior credit facility which borrowings bear interest at floating rates 
in december  the company purchased floating to fixed cross currency swaps in the full amount of the borrowings for the term of the facility 
consequently  the senior credit facility is not exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
in january  the company also purchased fixed to floating swaps after year end in the amount of million against its senior notes 
the total amount of senior notes outstanding is million 
each change in interest rates will result in an additional million in interest expense 
foreign exchange rates 
a substantial portion of the company s income is earned outside of the united states in currencies other than the united states dollar 
in addition  in  the company sold participations in canadian dollar denominated canwest debentures to the participation trust in exchange for us dollars 
the company has retained certain foreign exchange exposure in respect of this transaction 
as a result  the company s income is vulnerable to changes in the value of the united states dollar 
increases in the value of the united states dollar can reduce net earnings and declines can result in increased earnings 
based on earnings and ownership levels for the year ended december   a change in the important foreign currencies would have had the following effect on the company s reported net loss for the year ended december  actual average rate increase decrease united kingdom canada cdn  included in the exposure noted above is million in respect of the company s sale of participations 
in  the company sold participation interests in cdn 
million principal amount of canwest debentures to the participation trust at an exchange rate of to each canadian dollar  which translates into million 
at some time between may  and the maturity date of the canwest debentures  being november   we will be required to deliver to the participation trust million of the canwest debentures at then current exchange rates plus interest received 
the actual date of delivery will be established by noteholders of the participation trust 
as noted below  up until november   canwest may elect to pay interest on the debentures in kind or by the issuance of shares 
at december   the liability to the participation trust is million and the corresponding canwest debentures had a principal amount receivable of cdn 
million 
given that the canwest debentures are denominated in canadian dollars  the company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts in to mitigate the currency exposure 
the foreign currency contracts required the company to sell cdn 
million on may  at a forward rate of 
in  the company sold certain of its foreign currency contracts and subsequently entered into additional foreign currency contracts 
however  on september   all of the outstanding contracts were unwound resulting in the net cash receipt of million by the company after discounting for early settlement 
this amount has been included in other income expense  net  for the year ended december  the foreign exchange exposure is no longer hedged  due to constraints under our current debt facilities 
a change in the us dollar to canadian dollar exchange rate applied to the cdn 
million principal amount of the canwest debentures at december  would result in a million loss or gain to the company

the company anticipates that additional debentures will be received in the future as payment in kind for the interest on the debentures 
the balance of the foreign exchange exposure of million is principally as a result of the substantial reduction in the company s net investment in the canadian operations during the first quarter of as a result of this reduction  foreign exchange losses in the amount of million were included in net earnings for the three months ended march  and year ended 
table of contents december   substantially all of which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
had there been a change in the us dollar to canadian dollar in the three months ended march   net earnings would have increased or decreased by million 
given the sale of canadian operations in and  the only significant ongoing exposure to changes in the value of the canadian dollar is in respect of the participations noted above
