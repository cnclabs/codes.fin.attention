critical accounting policies and estimates 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent liabilities  at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant management judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require the most significant management judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts at the end of each quarter 
in performing this evaluation  the company analyzes the payment history of its significant past due accounts  subsequent cash collections on these accounts and the extent to which they are secured by bonds 
based on this information  the company develops what it considers to be a reasonable estimate of the uncollectible amounts included in trade receivables 
actual uncollectible amounts may differ from the company s estimate 
long lived assets 
the company reviews its long term assets for impairment in accordance with the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires that  when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  the company should determine if impairment of value exists 
if the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment exists and an impairment loss must be calculated and recorded 
if an impairment exists  the impairment loss is calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value 
any impairment loss is treated as a permanent reduction in the carrying value of the assets 
deferred tax assets 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event that it was determined that the company would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
conversely  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies 
the company is party to proceedings  lawsuits and claims arising in the normal course of business relating to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
the company is required to estimate the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue including coverage under the company s insurance policies 
this determination may change in the future because of new developments 
pension plan 
the company has one noncontributory defined benefit pension plan 
all benefit accruals under the plan ceased as of july  the company s costs  credits and funded status for this plan are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected long term return on plan assets 
future costs  credits and funded status for this plan may change should conditions warrant changes in the assumptions

the company has since filed suit against the former vp finance 
the former vp finance has stated that no one else at the company was involved in perpetrating the embezzlements 
based on the results of the special investigation  the company believes this statement to be accurate 
on march   the company received  in insurance proceeds from the company s insurance policies covering employee theft 
the  had been recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december  in prepaid expenses and other assets  and recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in other income in the fourth quarter in addition  the company retained counsel for assistance in its efforts to recover the embezzled funds from the former vp finance  and to pursue possible civil actions on behalf of the company against third parties 
the former vp finance has claimed not to have any funds 
any future recoveries will be recognized in the quarters in which they are realized  and the costs associated with of the company s special investigation  the company s cooperation with the sec  nasdaq  and criminal authorities in their investigations  and the company s ongoing recovery efforts are being expensed as incurred 
during  no additional recoveries were realized

these were partially offset by increased production and sales at the arkansas plant 
the increase in depreciation primarily resulted from a full year s depreciation in on the company s arkansas phase i modernization and expansion compared to eight months of depreciation in after phase i was completed 
the reduced production at the texas plant resulted in the depletion of finished goods inventories and increased costs through the purchase of lime from alternative sources to fulfill some of the company s sales commitments

liquidity and capital resources 
net cash provided by operating activities was  for  compared to  for the  improvement was primarily the result of changes in working capital 
the most significant changes in working capital resulted from  less cash being required to pay for accounts payable and accrued expenses during compared to the  cash required to pay for accounts payable and accrued expenses in primarily was for payments of costs incurred in related to the phase i modernization and expansion project at the arkansas facility 
in addition  the company reduced its inventories by  in  compared to a  increase in  and accounts receivable decreased  during  compared to a  increase in the  cash flow resulting from the decrease in prepaid expenses in was primarily due to the  in insurance proceeds received in march the company believes that the enhanced production capacity resulting from its modernization and expansion efforts at the texas and arkansas plants and the operational strategies implemented by management in the early part of have allowed the company to increase production  improve product quality  and better serve existing customers and attract new customers 
in spite of certain operational problems at the texas plant see results of operations vs 
 the company reduced its outstanding debt by  during capital expenditures 
the company completed the modernization and expansion project at the texas facility at the end of and phase i of the arkansas facility project in the second quarter the company expects to spend approximately  to  per year over the next several years for normal recurring capital and re equipping projects at the plant facilities to maintain or improve efficiency and reduce costs 
during the fourth quarter  the company commissioned a new line for the production of pulverized limestone at texas lime company 
this investment has allowed the company to pursue new business opportunities and to better serve existing customers 
the lack of reliability of a single production line had been a restraining factor on sales to several large customers requiring around the clock availability 
the new line resulted in new customers during and the arkansas modernization and expansion project was started in november and is expected to be completed in two phases phase i  which was completed in the second quarter  involved the redevelopment of the quarry plant  rebuilding of the railroad to standard gauge  the purchase of a facility to establish an out of state terminal in shreveport  louisiana  the installation of a rotary kiln with preheater and increased product storage and loading capacity 
the kiln in phase i produced its first lime on october   which continues to be of excellent quality and well received by customers 
after additional work in order to be fully operational and efficient  phase i of the modernization and expansion project for the arkansas plant was completed in the second quarter the total cost of phase i was approximately  the  includes  of costs associated with the pre building of certain facilities for phase ii of the arkansas project and the purchase of  but not all of the improvements to  the out of state terminal in shreveport  louisiana 
phase ii of the arkansas project will further expand the plant s capacity through the installation of a second kiln with additional storage capacity  and includes the completion of the out of state terminal in shreveport  louisiana for distribution of the company s products 
the estimated additional costs to complete phase ii is approximately  the company plans to proceed with phase ii at the optimum time based on its future operating results  market demand  financing and the ability to secure competitive construction bids 
as part of this financing  the company may decide to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities or both 
the company invested  in capital expenditures in  compared to  in in  capital expenditures of approximately  related to the completion of phase i of the arkansas facility 
during the fourth quarter  the company required additional capital because the costs to complete both phase i of the arkansas modernization and expansion project and the new pulverized limestone production line at texas were significantly higher than originally anticipated and because the company s cash flows and operating profits were lower than expected 
to meet its short term liquidity demands  the company made a pro rata rights offering to its existing shareholders to raise  in additional equity capital 
the rights offering closed on february   raising net proceeds of  banking facilities and other debt 
on april   the company entered into a credit agreement with a consortium of commercial banks for a  senior secured term loan the loan 
the loan is repayable over a period of approximately years  maturing on march   and requires monthly principal payments of approximately  which began april   with a final principal payment of  on march   which equates to a year amortization 
the company paid a fee equivalent to of the loan value to the placement agent 
upon execution of the loan agreement  the first  was advanced  of which approximately  was used to retire all existing bank loans  with the balance used primarily for phase i of the arkansas modernization and expansion project 
under the terms of the loan agreement  the remaining  of the loan facility was drawn down in four equal quarterly installments beginning june   and ending march  the interest rate on the first  of the loan is 
the subsequent installments bear interest from the date they were funded at above the secondary market yield of the united states treasury obligation maturing may  the blended rate for the additional  is 
the loan is secured by a first lien on substantially all of the company s assets  with the exception of accounts receivable and inventories which secure the company s  revolving credit facility 
the loan agreement contains covenants that restrict the incurrence of debt  guaranties  and liens  and places certain restrictions on the payment of dividends and the sale of significant assets 
the company is also required to meet minimum debt service coverage ratios on an on going basis and maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 
on april   the company renewed its revolving credit facility  with a new maturity date of may  the revolving credit facility was increased from  to  and bears interest at libor plus a margin of to in accordance with a defined rate spread based upon the company s then current ratio of total funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda

liquidity 
during the fourth quarter  the company required additional capital because the costs to complete both the arkansas phase i project and the new pulverized limestone production line at texas were significantly higher than originally anticipated and because the company s cash flows and operating profits were lower than expected 
to meet its short term liquidity demands  the company determined to make a pro rata rights offering to its existing shareholders to raise  in additional equity capital 
the company also obtained the  bridge loan from inberdon 
the company commenced the rights offering on december   and it closed on february  in the rights offering  the company raised an additional  in equity capital  realizing net proceeds of  and issued  shares of common stock at the subscription price of per share

future required contributions  if any  are subject to actuarial assumptions and future earnings on plan assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters 
the company s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions  waste management  water pollution  and worker health and safety  among other matters 
in part in response to requirements of environmental regulatory agencies  the company incurred capital expenditures related to environmental activities of approximately  in and  in in the judgment of management  forecastable environmental expenditure requirements for the future are not of such dimension as to have a materially adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  or competitive position 
additional factors 
short term liquidity demands 
funds available under the company s revolving credit facility and funds generated from operations should allow the company to meet current liquidity demands 
however  should the company s cash flows from operations deteriorate  the company may have to obtain additional financing  and there is no assurance the company will be able to do so given its current levels of indebtedness 
the company expects that cash from operations and funds available under its  revolving credit facility should permit the company to meet its short term liquidity demands 
due to the seasonal trends of its sales and revenues  the company will need to draw down from this revolving credit facility during the first half to provide for necessary repayments of principal and interest on its  loan  winter capital projects  normal recurring capital and re equipping projects and normal working capital needs 
the company expects to reduce the outstanding balance of its revolving credit facility during the second half effects of leverage and restrictions imposed by terms of the company s indebtedness 
following the closing of the company s  loan  the company was more leveraged than it had been in the past 
as of december   the company s total consolidated indebtedness and total stockholders equity were  and  respectively  and total indebtedness represented of total capitalization  compared to in as a result of the company s net repayment of  of debt during  the company s debt ratio has improved 
however  even with the improved debt ratio  a substantial portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness 
the company s ability to service its debt and to comply with the financial and restrictive covenants contained in the loan is subject to financial  economic  competitive  and other factors 
many of these factors are beyond the company s control 
in particular  the company s ability to service its indebtedness will depend upon its ability to sustain current levels of revenues and cash flows as a result of the modernization and expansion of the texas and arkansas plants 
factors that could affect operations 
in the normal course of the company s business  it faces risks that could have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations  cash flows  and competitive position 
not all risks are foreseeable or within the company s ability to control 
these risks arise from factors including  but not limited to  fluctuating demand for lime and limestone products  the company s ability to produce and store quantities of lime and limestone products sufficient to meet customer demands  the success of the company s modernization and expansion strategies  including its ability to execute the strategies and complete projects on time and within budget  the company s access to capital  energy costs especially natural gas prices  inclement weather  and the effects of seasonal trends 
environmental compliance 
the company incurs environmental compliance costs  including maintenance and operating costs with respect to pollution control facilities  the cost of ongoing monitoring programs  the cost of remediation efforts and other similar costs 
the company s operations are subject to various federal  state  and local environmental laws and regulations  including the clear air act  the clean water act  the resource conservation and recovery act  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  as well as the toxic substances control act 
the rate of change of such legislation has been rapid over the last decade  and compliance can require significant expenditures 
changes in environmental laws or discovery of currently unknown conditions could require additional expenditures by the company 
the epa is drafting regulations to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from lime plants 
existing facilities will not be subject to the rules until three years after they are promulgated 
due to the uncertainty of the scope of these regulations  there is no assurance that the future regulations will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
the epa is also seeking commitments from industry to reduce the production of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide 
the production of carbon dioxide is inherent in the manufacture of lime and other products  such as cement 
although the epa s current efforts to decrease greenhouse gas emissions are voluntary  there is no assurance that a change in the law will not be adopted that would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
the company intends to comply with all environmental laws  but because many of the requirements are subjective and therefore not quantifiable or presently determinable  or may be affected by future legislation and rulemaking  it is not possible to accurately predict the aggregate future costs of compliance and their effect on the the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or competitive position 
the company currently has no material provisions for estimated costs in connection with expected environmental related expenditures  because it is impossible to quantify the impact of all actions regarding environmental matters  particularly the extent and cost of future remediation and compliance efforts 
the company s operating air permits for arkansas phase i and phase ii cover air emissions generated at the facilities and contain stringent criteria that the new rotary lime kilns and plant must meet 
until both kilns are fully operational and have demonstrated the ability to comply with the permit conditions  there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required  or operating conditions imposed  in order to achieve compliance 
completion of phase ii of the arkansas project 
the company still plans to proceed with phase ii of the arkansas project and will continue to review the optimum start up time based on operating results  market demand  and the ability to secure competitive construction bids and financing 
the future construction of arkansas phase ii could also have a material adverse effect on the company due to the impact of start up costs and the potential for under utilization  especially in the start up phase 
no assurance can be given that the phase ii expansion of the arkansas facility will be completed on time or within budget  and it may be abandoned due to these or other issues 
further  notwithstanding current demand for lime and limestone products  the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to sell its products once increased production commences  or that any such sales will be profitable 
the company may decide to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for construction or other expansion costs  which could have a further dilutive effect on the ownership interests of current shareholders 
competition 
the lime industry is highly regionalized and competitive 
the company s competitors include both public and private companies 
the primary competitive factors in the lime industry are quality  price  ability to meet customer demand  proximity to the customer  personal relationships and timeliness of deliveries  with varying emphasis on these factors depending upon the specific product application 
to the extent that one or more of the company s competitors becomes more successful with respect to any key competitive factor  the company s financial condition  results of operations  cash flows  and competitive position could be materially adversely affected 
although demand and prices for lime and limestone have been relatively strong in recent years  the company is unable to predict future demand and prices  and cannot provide any assurance that current levels of demand and prices will continue or that any future increases in demand or price can be sustained
