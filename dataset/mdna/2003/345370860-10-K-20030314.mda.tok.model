item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the improved fourth quarter results in our north american automotive operations reflected primarily the non recurrence of the asset impairments and other one time charges that were primarily related to our revitalization plan  as well as improvements in cost performance primarily lower costs related to warranty coverages and additional service actions  net revenue and vehicle mix 
these were offset partially by lower unit sales volume in due primarily to lower us industry demand down  units to million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis and lower market share down percentage points to for ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles  compared with levels 
the decrease in fourth quarter results in europe reflected charges related to restructuring actions involving our ford brand europe and premier automotive group operations  as well as a less favorable vehicle mix and lower production for dealer inventories 
these were partially offset by a higher european market share up percentage points to for all vehicle brands 
the fourth quarter restructuring charges in europe discussed above totaled million for ford brand operations and million for premier automotive group operations  with each primarily reflecting employee separation costs 
in the case of ford brand operations  the employee separation costs were incurred primarily in preparation for the planned transfer of production of the transit vehicle from our genk  belgium facility to a facility owned by an unconsolidated joint venture in turkey ford otosan in which we have a equity interest 
our automotive sector losses in south america were million from operations in the fourth quarter of  compared with a loss of million for the same period one year ago 
the improvement reflected primarily the non recurrence of the asset impairments and other restructuring charges that were largely related to our revitalization plan and the reversal of accruals related to trade tariffs as a result of the settlement between brazil and argentina of mercosur trade balance rules 
the results also reflected improved operating fundamentals  partially offset by lower industry volumes

earnings at hertz in the fourth quarter of were million  compared with a loss of million a year ago 
the profit increase was primarily due to improved worldwide car rental volume and pricing  the continued recovery from the adverse impact the terrorist attacks of september  had on business travel during the fourth quarter of  and cost reductions

additionally  profits improved due to achievement of our milestone to reduce non product costs by billion and the replenishment of dealer inventories in the us  which were unusually low at year end these improvements were partially offset by increased product related costs and lower market share

in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in the united states  down from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  down percentage points from a year ago

adjusted for constant volume and mix and excluding unusual items and costs related to our firestone tire replacement action  our total costs in the automotive sector increased billion compared with our automotive sector losses from continuing operations in north america were  million in on sales of billion  compared with earnings of  million in on sales of billion 
the earnings deterioration reflected primarily lower vehicle unit sales volumes  the charges associated with the revitalization plan and the other charges outlined above  significantly increased marketing costs  costs associated with the firestone tire replacement action and increased costs associated with warranty and additional service actions 
in  approximately million new cars and trucks were sold in the united states  down from million units in our share of those unit sales was in  down percentage points from a year ago  due primarily to increased competition resulting from new model entrants into the truck and sport utility vehicle segments  as well as the continued weakness of the japanese yen  which creates favorable pricing opportunities for our japanese competitors 
marketing costs for our ford  lincoln and mercury brands increased to of sales of those brands  up from a year ago  reflecting increased competitive pricing in the form of subsidized financing and leasing programs such as financing during the fourth quarter  cash rebates and other incentive programs 
our automotive sector earnings in europe were million from continuing operations in  compared with losses of  million a year ago

financial services sector results of operations our financial services sector consists primarily of two segments  ford credit and hertz 
details of our financial services sector earnings from continuing operations for   and are shown below in millions income loss from continuing operations ford credit   hertz minority interests and other total financial services sector   compared with ford credit s consolidated income from continuing operations was  million  up million from apart from the non recurrence of last year s revitalization plan charges  the improvement in earnings reflected primarily a lower provision for credit losses  offset partially by the net unfavorable impact of receivable sales and lower net financing margins 
revenue from the sale of finance receivables includes the gain on sales of finance receivables through securitizations and whole loan sale transactions and servicing fee income from sold receivables that ford credit continues to service 
gains or losses on sales of receivables are recognized in the period in which they are sold 
in addition  the sale of finance receivables through securitization transactions provides revenue from the interest earned on securities sold by the securitization entity that ford credit retains  our undivided interest in wholesale receivables  and other income related to interest only assets 
interest only assets  also referred to as excess spread  represent ford credit s right to receive collections on sold receivables that are in excess of the amount needed to pay principal and interest payments to investors and servicing fees 
as shown below  total revenue related to receivables sales was  million in  compared with  million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in resulted from the growth in ford credit s outstanding sold receivables balances over the last two years 
gains on sales of receivables in were about the same as those in  reflecting lower gains per dollar of retail receivables sold about in  compared with in sales of receivables reduce ford credit s financing revenues in the year the receivables are sold  as well as in future years  compared with what they otherwise would be if ford credit continued to own the receivables 
these foregone revenues can reduce financing margins and offset any positive impact associated with the gain on sales of receivables 
the net impact of securitizations on ford credit s revenues and earnings in a given year will vary depending on the amount  type of receivable and timing of securitizations in the current year and the preceding two to three year period  as well as the interest item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued rate environment at the times the finance receivables were originated and securitized

if calculated on a basis using ford credit s average borrowing cost for unsecured debt  the reduction in financing margin from securitization would be significantly lower and the estimated after tax impact of receivable sales would be significantly higher than the amounts shown 
earnings at hertz in  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  were million 
the hertz results shown here include amortization of intangibles at ford fsg  inc  hertz parent company  which is not applicable to hertz financial statements

the increase in earnings  before the change in accounting principle  was principally due to an improved car rental pricing environment and lower costs

these are assets that we retained in connection with our sale of the assets of usl capital corporation in the charge  totaling million after tax  is specifically related to aircraft leases to united airlines twelve aircraft and us airways five aircraft which are in bankruptcy  and telecommunications equipment leases to a worldcom subsidiary 
in all  the partnership has leased aircraft to lessees  primarily to us based airlines  our share of the partnership s remaining investment in aircraft leases is about million 
compared with ford credit s consolidated income from continuing operations in was million  down million or from excluding ford credit s share of the charges associated with the revitalization plan  net income was about billion  down million compared with  due primarily to a higher provision for credit losses and the net unfavorable impact of sfas no 
from hedging activity  offset partially by favorable earnings effects related to securitization transactions  higher financing volumes of finance receivables and operating leases and improved financing margins 
earnings at hertz in were million 
in  hertz had earnings of million 
the decrease in earnings was primarily due to lower car rental volume in the united states  reflecting the adverse impact on business travel and downward pricing pressure due to the slowdown in the united states economy and the adverse impact of the terrorist attacks 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources automotive sector for the automotive sector  liquidity and capital resources include gross cash balances  cash generated from operations  our ability to raise funds in capital markets and committed credit lines 
gross cash automotive gross cash includes cash and marketable securities and assets contained in a voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust  which are financial assets available to fund certain future employee benefit obligations in the near term  as summarized below in billions december  cash and cash equivalents marketable securities veba gross cash in managing our business  we classify changes in gross cash in three categories operating including capital expenditures and capital transactions with the financial services sector  acquisitions and divestitures  and financing 
changes for the last three years are summarized below in billions december  gross cash at end of period gross cash at beginning of period total change in gross cash operating related cash flows automotive net income loss non cash  one time charges depreciation and special tools amortization changes in receivables  inventory and trade payables other primarily expense and payment timing differences capital transactions with financial services sector capital expenditures total operating related cash flows before tax refunds tax refunds total operating related cash flows divestitures and asset sales acquisitions and capital contributions financing related cash flows convertible trust preferred securities value enhancement plan dividends to shareholders net issuance purchase of stock changes in total automotive sector debt total financing related cash flows total change in gross cash includes the net of capital contributions  dividends  loans and loan repayments 
in  we had non cash one time charges of billion  reflecting primarily impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets which eliminates amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets  but requires annual testing for impairment  losses on the sales of kwik fit and other businesses  and restructuring charges in our ford brand european automotive operations and premier automotive group operations 
timing differences between the recognition of certain expenses or revenue reductions and their corresponding cash payments are recognized in operating related cash flows 
in  these differences and other miscellaneous items improved our operating related cash flows by billion  denoted as item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued other in the table above 
these timing differences arise primarily from accrual of health care  marketing  warranty and additional service action costs before the corresponding cash payments are required to be made 
in  we spent billion for automotive sector capital goods  such as machinery  equipment  tooling and facilities 
this was up million from  reflecting primarily increased spending on new products consistent with our product led revitalization 
capital expenditures were of sales in  up percentage points from a year ago 
during  we received billion of net proceeds from the issuance of our cumulative convertible trust preferred securities and about billion of income tax refunds 
these two factors alone explain substantially all of the billion increase in our gross cash balances during capital transactions with the financial services sector improved cash flow by million  reflecting primarily dividends from ford credit  net of a million cash contribution from ford indirectly to ford credit in january shown in the table below is a reconciliation between operating related cash flow above and financial statement cash flows from operating activities before securities trading in billions full year operating related cash flows items ford includes in operating related cash flow capital transactions with financial services sector capital expenditures net transactions between automotive and financial services sectors other  primarily exclusion of cash in flows from veba draw down total reconciling items cash flows from operating activities before securities trading primarily payables and receivables between the sectors in the normal course of business  as shown in our sector statement of cash flows 
debt and net cash at december   our automotive sector had total debt of billion  up million from a year ago 
the weighted average maturity of our long term debt  substantially all of which is fixed rate debt  is approximately years with about billion maturing by december  the weighted average maturity of total debt long term and short term is approximately years 
at december   our automotive sector had net cash defined as gross cash less total debt of billion  compared with billion and billion at the end of and  respectively 
credit facilities at december   the automotive sector had billion of contractually committed credit agreements with various banks  eighty eight percent of the total facilities are committed through june  ford has the ability to transfer on a non guaranteed basis billion of these credit lines to ford credit or fce bank  plc  ford credit s european operation fce 
all of our global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants for example  debt to equity limitations  minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit out ability to borrow 
approximately million of these facilities were in use at december  other securities ford motor company capital trust i and ford motor company capital trust ii together have outstanding an aggregate billion of trust preferred securities as described in note of the notes to our financial statements 
these securities are not included in the total debt amounts discussed above 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we redeemed our series b cumulative preferred stock for an aggregate redemption price of million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued financial services sector ford credit debt and cash ford credit s total debt was billion at december   down billion compared with a year ago 
ford credit s outstanding commercial paper not including commercial paper issued to affiliates at december  totaled billion 
the average remaining maturity of ford credit s commercial paper in north america and europe was days 
at december   ford credit had cash and cash equivalents of billion 
in the normal course of its funding activities  ford credit may generate more proceeds than are necessary for its immediate funding needs 
this excess funding is referred to as overborrowings 
of the billion of cash and cash equivalents  billion represented overborrowings  while the remaining billion was employed in operating activities 
funding ford credit requires substantial funding in the normal course of business 
ford credit s funding requirements are driven mainly by the need to i purchase retail installment sale contracts and vehicle leases to support the sale of ford products  which to a large extent are influenced by ford sponsored special financing and leasing programs that are available exclusively through ford credit  ii provide vehicle inventory and capital financing for ford dealers  and iii repay its debt obligations 
funding sources for ford credit include the sale of commercial paper  issuance of term debt  the sale of receivables in securitization transactions and  in the case of fce  the issuance of certificates of deposit 
these funds are obtained from investors in various markets 
ford credit s commercial paper issuances are used to meet short term funding needs 
ford credit has commercial paper programs in the united states  europe  canada and other international markets 
it reduced the amount of its outstanding global unsecured commercial paper from billion at the end of to billion billion net of overborrowings and including commercial paper sold to other ford affiliates at december  by replacing such funding with term debt and proceeds from the sale of receivables 
during  ford credit plans to have commercial paper outstanding at levels of around billion to billion  net of overborrowings 
ford credit also obtains short term funding through the issuance of variable denomination  floating rate demand notes through its ford money market account program 
at december   billion of such notes were outstanding 
bank borrowings are an additional source of short term funding in certain international markets 
long term funding requirements for ford credit are met through the issuance of a variety of debt securities in both the united states and international capital markets 
during  ford credit issued approximately billion of term debt with maturities ranging between one and thirty years 
during  ford credit plans to raise billion to billion through term debt issuances and billion to billion through public term securitization transactions  which are discussed below 
other sources of funds include bank borrowings  mainly in countries where capital markets are less developed 
during  ford credit continued to meet a significant portion of its funding requirements by selling finance receivables in securitizations because of the stability of investor appetite for asset backed securities  their lower relative cost as described below  and the diversification of funding sources that they provide 
ford credit also developed or expanded additional funding sources  including retail unsecured bond issuances  new asset backed commercial paper programs and international securitization programs 
in addition  ford credit launched a whole loan sale program that will reduce future funding requirements 
under the whole loan sale program  ford credit sells retail loans without holding any retained interests in such loans and receives fee income as it continues to service those loans 
ford credit sold billion of retail loans through this program in the fourth quarter of  and expects to complete further sales in because ford credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program  it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables 
accordingly  ford credit does not treat such receivables as managed receivables and whole loan sales of receivables are excluded from the discussion of securitization transactions below 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as a result of ford credit s expanded securitization sources and other actions  the decline in debt ratings ford credit experienced in and did not have a material impact on its ability to fund operations and maintain liquidity 
any further lowering of ford credit s debt ratings would increase its borrowing costs and potentially constrain certain funding availability from the capital markets 
this in turn likely would cause ford credit to rely more heavily on funding through securitization transactions  or to reduce its assets and liabilities 
ford credit s ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell  the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions  general demand for the type of receivables ford credit offers  market capacity for ford credit sponsored investments  market disruption and ford credit s debt ratings 
if as a result of any of these or other factors  the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to ford credit  its liquidity would be adversely impacted 
the cost of both unsecured term debt and funding through securitization transactions is based on the margin or spread over a benchmark interest rate  such as the london interbank offered rate or interest rates paid on us treasury securities of similar maturities 
spreads are typically measured in basis points  where one basis point equals one one hundredth of one percent 
since  the three year fixed rate spread on ford credit s securitized funding has been at a level between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities  while ford credit s unsecured term debt spreads have fluctuated between basis points and basis points above comparable us treasury securities 
in  ford credit s unsecured term debt spreads fluctuated between and basis points above comparable us treasury securities  with an average spread of basis points and a year end spread of basis points above comparable us treasury securities 
ford credit s worldwide proceeds from the sale of retail and wholesale finance receivables through securtizations and whole loan sales are shown below for the years ended december in billions receivable type retail wholesale net proceeds for additional funding and to maintain liquidity  ford credit has contractually committed credit facilities with financial institutions that totaled billion at december   including billion available for fce 
the majority of these facilities are available through june  and million was in use at december  primarily by affiliates outside of the united states and europe 
in addition  banks provide billion of contractually committed liquidity facilities to support ford credit s asset backed commercial paper programs 
all of ford credit s global credit facilities are free of material adverse change clauses and restrictive financial covenants for example  debt to equity limitations  minimum net worth requirements and credit rating triggers that would limit its ability to borrow 
ford credit also has entered into agreements with several bank sponsored  commercial paper issuers conduits under which such issuers are contractually committed to purchase from ford credit or hold  at ford credit s option  up to an aggregate of billion of receivables 
these agreements have varying maturity dates between march  and october  as of december   approximately billion of these commitments were used 
these programs do not contain restrictive financial covenants for example  debt to equity limitations or minimum net worth requirements or material adverse change clauses that could preclude selling receivables  but do contain provisions that would terminate those commitments if the performance of the sold receivables deteriorates beyond specified levels 
none of these arrangements may be terminated based on a change in our credit rating

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin on the cost and availability of these conduit facilities  see off balance sheet arrangements variable interest entities  below 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at december   ford credit s debt to equity ratio was to on a managed basis excluding the effect of axus  our all makes vehicle fleet leasing operation  that was held for sale  down from to at december  in calculating its managed leverage  ford credit adds outstanding securitized receivables but not receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions to debt  and nets against this amount its retained interests in securitized receivables and its cash  including overborrowings 
ford credit also adjusts both debt and equity for effects of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in the calculation of managed leverage because sfas no 
adjustments vary over the term of the underlying debt and securitized funding obligations based on changes in market rates and we generally repay our debt as it matures 
hertz hertz requires funding for the acquisition of revenue earning equipment  which consists of vehicles and industrial and construction equipment 
hertz purchases this equipment in accordance with the terms of agreements negotiated with automobile and equipment manufacturers 
the financing requirements of hertz are seasonal and are mainly explained by the seasonality of the travel industry 
hertz fleet size  and its related financing requirements  generally peak in the months of june and july  and decline during the months of december and january 
hertz accesses the global capital markets to meet its funding needs 
hertz maintains unsecured domestic and foreign commercial paper programs and a secured domestic commercial paper program to cover short term funding needs  and also draws from bank lines  as a normal business practice  to fund international needs 
hertz also is active in the domestic medium term and long term debt markets 
during  hertz launched an asset backed securitization program for its domestic car rental fleet to reduce its borrowing costs and enhance its financing resources 
as of december   million was outstanding under this program 
at december   hertz had committed credit facilities totaling billion 
of this amount  billion represented global and other committed credit facilities billion of which are available through june  and billion of which have various maturities of up to four years  million consisted of a revolving credit line provided by ford  which currently expires in june  million consisted of asset backed letters of credit  and million consisted of day asset backed commercial paper facilities 
total company stockholders equity our stockholders equity was billion at december   down billion compared with december  as described below  changes in the funded status of our pension funds adversely impacted stockholders equity by billion  which was partially offset by favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of billion 
our stockholders equity also was reduced in by net losses of million and dividend payments of million 
post retirement obligations we sponsor defined benefit pension plans whose pension fund assets consist principally of investments in equities and in government and other fixed income securities 
for our major us pension funds  the target asset allocation is equities and fixed income securities 
on december   the market value of our us pension fund assets was less than the projected benefit obligations calculated using a discount rate of  which is reduced from used at year end by billion for our us plans 
for us plans  the shortfall as of december   was billion  for a total worldwide shortfall of billion 
our stockholders equity was reduced by billion at december  because of increased pension under funding 
pension funding obligations and strategies are highly dependent on investment returns  discount rates  actuarial assumptions  and benefit levels which can be contractually specified  such as those under the ford uaw retirement plan that is subject to negotiation in 
if these assumptions were to remain unchanged  we project that we would not have a legal requirement to fund our major us pension plans item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued before however  we review our pension assumptions regularly and we do from time to time make contributions beyond those legally required 
for example  in january we contributed million in cash to the us pension funds and  depending on a determination that it will be deductible for us income tax purposes  expect to contribute an additional million by june further  after giving effect to these contributions  based on current interest rates and on our return assumptions and assuming no additional contributions  we do not expect to be required to pay any variable rate premiums to the pension benefit guaranty corporation before we sponsor post retirement health care plans  primarily in the us we partially fund these obligations through a veba trust  which is invested in short term fixed income investments 
debt ratings our short and long term debt are rated by three nationally recognized statistical rating organizations fitch  inc fitch  moody s investors service  inc moody s  and standard poor s rating services  a division of mcgraw hill companies  inc s p 
in addition to these three rating agencies  we also are rated in several local markets by locally recognized rating agencies 
debt ratings reflect an assessment by the rating agencies of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue  and are based on information provided by us or other sources 
lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets 
long and short term debt ratings of bbb and f or higher by fitch  baa and p or higher by moody s and bbb and a or higher by s p are considered investment grade 
however  debt ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell  or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating agency may have different criteria in evaluating the risk associated to a company  and therefore ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency 
fitch ratings

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into various arrangements not reflected on our balance sheet that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
these include guarantees  sales of receivables by ford credit  and variable interest entities  each of which is discussed below 
guarantees see also note of the notes to our financial statements occasionally  we guarantee debt and lease obligations of joint venture entities and other third parties with which we do business to support their growth 
as of december   our maximum potential exposure under these guarantees was million 
in the ordinary course of business  we also execute contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry and indemnifications specific to a transaction 
these indemnifications include claims for any of the following environmental  tax  and shareholder matters  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and employment related matters  financial matters  and dealer  supplier  and other commercial contractual relationships 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by a breach of terms of the contract or by a third party claim 
sales of receivables by ford credit securitizations ford credit regularly uses securitization to fund its operations 
ford credit securitizes its receivables because the highly liquid and efficient market provides ford credit with a cost effective source of funding 
ford credit most frequently securitizes retail installment sale contracts 
ford credit also securitizes receivables from ford franchised dealers and non ford dealers representing loans used to finance their automobile floorplan inventories  generally referred to as wholesale receivables or floorplan receivables 
ford credit occasionally engages in securitization of operating leases 
in  ford credit significantly expanded securitization of finance receivables by foreign subsidiaries 
in a typical securitization  ford credit sells a pool of finance receivables to a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote special purpose subsidiary that establishes a separate special purpose trust or entity spe and transfers the receivables to the spe in exchange for the proceeds from securities issued by the spe 
following the transfer of the sold receivables to the spe  the receivables are no longer assets of ford credit and the sold receivables no longer appear on our balance sheet 
the spe issues interest bearing securities  usually notes or certificates of various maturities and interest rates  which are paid by the spe from future collections on the receivables it owns 
these securities  commonly referred to as asset backed securities  are structured into senior and subordinated classes 
the senior classes have priority over the subordinated classes in receiving collections from the receivables and may also benefit from other enhancements such as over collateralization  excess spread and cash reserve funds 
these securities generally are rated by independent rating agencies and sold in public offerings or in private transactions 
ford credit uses spes in securitization transactions to achieve isolation of the sold receivables for the benefit of securitization investors 
assuming  accounting rules are met  the sold receivables are removed from our balance sheet 
the use of spes in this way allows the spe to issue senor securities typically with a higher debt rating than ford credit s debt securities in a highly liquid and efficient market  thereby providing ford credit with a cost effective source of funding 
the two tiered sale of receivables to a wholly owned subsidiary and then to the spe is conventional in the asset backed securitization market 
most of the spes used in ford credit s securitization transactions are classified as qualifying special purpose entities consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  because of the nature of the assets held by these entities and the limited nature of their activities 
ford credit also sponsors one securitization spe  fcar owner trust fcar  that is not a qualifying spe under sfas no 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued because its permitted activities are notsufficiently limited 
however  because fcar maintains substantive third party equity  this entity is not required to be consolidated in our financial statements at december  under applicable accounting rules 
however  see variable interest entities below and note of the notes to our financial statements for a further discussion of the impact of fin on ford credit s fcar securitization structure and on other securitization structures utilized by ford credit 
none of our or ford credit s officers  directors or employees holds any equity interest in the spes or receives any direct or indirect compensation from the spes 
the spes do not own stock in either ford or ford credit or any of their affiliates 
ford credit or its affiliates often retain interests in the securitized receivables 
the retained interests may include senior and subordinated securities  undivided interests in wholesale receivables  restricted cash held for the benefit of the spes and interest only strips 
subordinated securities represent lower rated classes of securities issued by the spes 
restricted cash is funded initially by a small portion of proceeds from the sale of receivables that may be used to pay principal and interest to spe investors and  after investors are fully paid  remaining cash is returned to ford credit 
interest only strips  also referred to as excess spread  represent the right to receive collections on the sold finance receivables in excess of amounts needed by the spe to pay interest and principal to investors  servicing fees and other required payments 
the subordinated securities  restricted cash  interest only strips  and a portion of the undivided interest in wholesale receivables serve as credit enhancements to the holders of the more senior securities issued by the spes 
at december  and  the total outstanding principal amount of receivables sold by ford credit in securitizations was billion and billion  respectively 
at those dates  ford credit s retained interests in such sold receivables were billion and billion  respectively 
ford credit has no obligation to repurchase any sold receivable that becomes delinquent in payment or otherwise is in default 
the holders of the asset backed securities have no recourse to ford credit or its other assets for credit losses on the sold receivables and have no ability to require ford credit to repurchase their securities 
ford credit does not guarantee any securities issued by spes 
however  as is customary in asset backed securitization transactions  ford credit  as the seller of the finance receivables to the spe and servicer of such receivables  is obligated to provide certain kinds of support 
these support obligations include indemnification of the spe and its trustees  the requirement to repurchase receivables that do not meet eligibility criteria or that have been materially modified by the servicer  the obligation to sell additional receivables in certain transactions and the advancing of interest payment short falls 
based on its experience  ford credit does not expect to make any indemnification payments 
in  ford credit was not required to repurchase any sold receivables due to their failure to meet eligibility criteria and the principal amount of recievables repurchased due to servicer modifications was about million for all retail securitization programs 
whole loan sales in the fourth quarter of  ford credit sold about billion of retail installment sale contracts in two whole loan sale transactions 
in addition  ford credit is contractually committed to sell an additional billion of retail installment sale contract receivables in the first quarter of through a whole loan sale transaction 
in respect of whole loan sale transactions  ford credit generally has the same indemnification  repurchase and other obligations in whole loan sale transactions as it does in securitization transactions 
these continuing obligations are discussed above 
ford credit retains servicing rights and obligations with respect to the receivables sold in whole loan sale transactions and earns a servicing fee 
unlike securitizations  however  whole loan sale transactions involve the sale of receivables without ford credit or one of its affiliates retaining any interest in the sold receivables 
because ford credit does not have retained interests in receivables sold through its whole loan program  it does not have contractual or economic risk of loss associated with those retained interests with respect to whole loan sales of receivables 
no spes are used in ford credit s whole loan sale program 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risks to future sales of receivables some of ford credit s securitization programs contain structural features that could prevent further funding if the credit losses or delinquencies on a pool of sold receivables or on ford credit s overall managed portfolio exceed specified levels or if payment rates on or amounts of wholesale receivables are lower than specified levels 
ford credit does not expect that any of these features will have a material adverse impact on its ability to securitize receivables 
in addition  ford credit s ability to sell its receivables may be affected by the following factors the amount and credit quality of receivables available to sell  the performance of receivables sold in previous transactions  general demand for the type of receivables ford credit offers  market capacity for ford credit sponsored investments  market disruption and ford credit s debt ratings 
if as a result of any of these or other factors  the cost of securitized funding significantly increased or securitized funding were no longer available to ford credit  its liquidity would be adversely impacted 
variable interest entities see also item properties and note of the notes to our financial statements automotive our automotive sector has invested in several joint ventures that are reported as equity investments 
in many cases  we have contracted with these joint ventures to manufacture and or assemble vehicles or components 
we have invested and contracted with these entities to obtain low cost  high quality parts and vehicles  world class niche product development capabilities and the ability to leverage the technical expertise of our joint venture partners 
these investments may involve a transfer of assets in exchange for an equity interest 
in some cases  we have agreed to guarantee the debt of the entity  in others we have unconditional supply arrangements that are used by the entity to secure financing 
in many cases  labor used by the joint ventures are ford employees  the cost of which we are reimbursed  however  failing reimbursement we are ultimately responsible for the costs of these employees 
the terms of these supply arrangements are a result of arms length negotiation 
for a discussion of the impact of fin on our accounting for these joint ventures  see note of the notes to our financial statements 
financial services it is reasonably possible that fcar  in its existing structure  may be consolidated in our financial results in compliance with fin our equity investment and retained beneficial interest related to fcar is approximately billion  which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   fcar had gross assets of billion and gross liabilities of billion 
we continue to assess structures that would maintain fcar as an unconsolidated entity under fin we are continuing to analyze the impact on our financial statements of fin and its impact on fcar 
in addition  ford credit also sells receivables to bank sponsored asset backed commercial paper issuers that are spes of the sponsor bank 
fin might also require the sponsor banks to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the spes into their financial results 
if this occurs  the sponsor banks may increase the program fees for ford credit s use of these spes or fail to renew their commitment to purchase additional receivables from ford credit 
at december   about billion of retail installment sale contracts ford credit originated were held by these spes 
we believe we would not be required to consolidate any portion of these spes in our financial results 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of fin on the bank sponsors of these spes and on the continued availability and costs of this program 
we believe bank sponsors will not terminate their spes or reduce their purchase of receivables 
aggregate contractual obligations we are party to many contractual obligations involving commitments to make payments to third parties 
most of these are debt obligations incurred by our financial services sector 
in addition  as part of our normal business practices  we enter into contracts with suppliers for purchases of certain raw materials  components and services 
these arrangements may contain fixed or minimum quantity purchase requirements 
we enter into such arrangements to facilitate adequate supply of these materials item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued and services 
many of these obligations are recorded  others are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements 
some obligations are executory contracts and therefore are not recognized as liabilities until the occurrence of a future event 
in order to provide information about our short and long term liquidity needs  a disclosure of selected obligations is displayed below in millions payments due by period less more than than total year years years years debt obligations      capital lease obligations operating lease obligations   total      critical accounting estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the foregoing disclosure 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
warranty and additional service actions see notes and of the notes to our financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for warranties and additional service actions 
nature of estimates required the estimated warranty and additional service action costs for each vehicle sold by us are accrued at the time the vehicle is sold to a dealer 
included in the accruals are the costs for both basic warranty and additional service action on vehicles we sell 
estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each vehicle line and each model year of that vehicle line  where little or no claims experience may exist 
in addition  the number and magnitude of additional service actions expected to be approved  and policies related to additional service actions  are taken into consideration 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimated factors  changes in our assumptions could materially affect net income 
assumptions and approach used our estimate of warranty and additional service action obligations is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for any given model year can be volatile  therefore  our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data are available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
resulting balances are then compared with present spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 
pension see note of the notes to our financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
nature of estimates required the measurement of our pension obligations  costs and liabilities item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to all plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the plan trustee conducts an independent valuation of the fair value of pension plan assets 
assumptions and approach used the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors o discount rates o inflation o salary growth o expected return on plan assets o retirement rates o mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  investment strategy and the views of investment managers and other large pension plan sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods

 allowance for credit losses see note of the notes to our financial statements for more information regarding our allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is our estimate of the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases as of the date of the financial statements 
significant judgment is required in estimating this amount because credit losses vary substantially over time  and estimating probable losses requires a number of assumptions about matters which are uncertain 
nature of estimates required we estimate the probable credit losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases by evaluating several different factors with econometric models 
these factors include historical credit loss trends  the credit quality of our present portfolio  trends in historical and projected used vehicle values  and general economic measures 
assumptions and approach used the factors listed above result in a projection of two key assumptions o frequency the percentage of finance receivables and operating leases that we expect to default over a period of time  which is measured principally by the repossession rate the ratio of the number of vehicles repossessed in a time period divided by the average number of accounts outstanding in the same time period o loss severity the difference between the amount a customer owes us when we charge off the finance contract and the amount we receive  net of expenses  from selling the repossessed vehicle  including any recoveries from the customer 
we estimate the expected frequency and loss severity with econometric models 
we monitor credit loss performance monthly and assess the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses quarterly 
sensitivity analysis we believe the present level of our allowance for credit losses is adequate to cover the probable losses related to impaired finance receivables and operating leases  however  changes in the assumptions to derive frequency and severity would have an impact on the allowance for credit losses 
over the past three years  repossession rates for our us retail and lease portfolio have varied between and 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the effect of the indicated increase decrease in the assumptions is shown below for retail and lease receivables that finance ford  lincoln  and mercury vehicles in the united states in millions effect on december  provision assumption percentage allowance for for credit point credit losses losses change higher lower higher lower repossession rates pts 
loss severity pts 
changes in our assumptions affect the provision for credit losses on our income statement and the allowance for credit and insurance losses on our balance sheet 
accumulated depreciation on operating leases accumulated depreciation on operating leases reflects the cumulative amount of depreciation that has been recorded to date  reducing the value of the vehicles in our operating lease portfolio from their original acquisition value to their projected residual value at the end of the lease term 
nature of estimates required each operating lease in our portfolio represents a vehicle we own that has been leased to a customer 
at the origination of the lease  we establish an estimated residual value for the vehicle at lease end 
significant judgment is required in estimating the expected lease end residual value because future market values of used vehicles are difficult to predict 
we depreciate leased vehicles on a straight line basis to estimated residual value 
we monitor residual value performance by vehicle line monthly 
we review the adequacy of our accumulated depreciation on a quarterly basis 
if we believe that the residual values for our vehicles have decreased  we revise depreciation for the affected vehicles to ensure that the book value our net investment in the operating lease  equal to our acquisition value of the vehicles less accumulated depreciation will be reduced to our revised estimate of residual value at the end of the lease term 
such adjustments to depreciation expense are recorded over the remaining term of the contracts of affected vehicles in our portfolio on a straight line basis 
each lease retail customer has the option to buy the leased vehicle at the end of the lease or to return the vehicle to the dealer 
in the latter case  the dealer then has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual lease end value or return it to us 
for returned vehicles  we face a potential risk that the book value of the vehicle will exceed the auction value 
over the last five years  about to of retail leased vehicles have been returned to us 
assumptions and approach used our accumulated depreciation on operating leases is based on the following assumptions o auction value the expected o return rates the expected market value of the vehicle at percentage of vehicles that the end of the lease 
will be returned at the end of the lease 
we estimate expected auction values and return rates with econometric models 
these models use historical auction values  historical return rates for our leased vehicles  industry wide used vehicle prices  our marketing plans and vehicle quality data 
sensitivity analysis the largest impact of changes in assumptions is on ford credit s us retail operating leases of ford  lincoln and mercury brand vehicles 
if future auction values for all of the ford  lincoln  and mercury vehicles in our us operating lease portfolio at year end were to decrease by per unit from our present estimates  we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by a cumulative amount of about million in the through period to cause the book value at the end of the lease term for these vehicles to be equal to the revised residual value 
similarly  if future return rates for our existing portfolio of ford  lincoln and mercury vehicles in the us were to increase by one item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percentage point from our present estimates  we would increase our depreciation on these vehicles by about million in the through period 
changes in the amount of accumulated depreciation on operating leases will be reflected on our balance sheet in net investment in operating leases and on the income statement in the depreciation line of the financial services sector

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued outlook financial milestones we have set and communicated certain financial milestones for the financial milestones for are as follows planning assumptions industry volume us million units europe million units net pricing us zero europe physicals milestone quality improve in all regions market share improve in all regions automotive cost performance at constant volume and mix improve by at least million capital spending billion financial results automotive income before taxes breakeven operating cash flow breakeven ford credit improve cash contribution to parent maintain managed leverage in low end of to range consistent with operating cash flow calculation under liquidity and capital resources automotive sector above 
consistent with definition of leverage under liquidity and capital resources financial services sector above 
based on the planning assumptions set forth above and achievement of the foregoing milestones  we expect fully diluted earnings to be about cents per share for the full year and cents per share for the first quarter 
for the full year  we expect the automotive sector to break even and the financial services sector to provide improved cash contributions to the parent company 
revitalization plan update in january  we announced our revitalization plan  which is expected to improve our pre tax income to billion by mid decade 
excluding unusual items  our pre tax earnings in were well in excess of the breakeven target we set when we announced the revitalization plan last year 
we also made improvements to our cost structure consistent with the revitalization plan 
with the progress made on costs in  coupled with the acceleration of cost reductions planned for this year  we expect profits to be ahead of the original plan this year as well 
this expectation is reflected in our full year earnings target of cents per share 
pension and health care expenses we sponsor defined benefit pension plans throughout the world and post retirement health care plans  primarily in the united states 
we also provide health care coverage for our active employees  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued primarily in the united states 
pursuant to our collective bargaining agreement with the uaw  under which most of our us hourly employees are covered  we are contractually committed to provide specified levels of pension and health care benefits to both employees and retirees covered by the contract 
these obligations give rise to significant expenses that are highly dependent on assumptions discussed in note of the notes to our financial statements and under critical accounting estimates above 
based on present assumptions and benefit agreements  we expect our us pre tax pension expense to be about million  which is about million higher than it was in in  our health care costs for united states employees was billion  with about billion attributable to retirees and million attributable to active employees 
our health care costs in the united states have been rising at about a year over the last two years 
the cost of prescription drugs  which rose about in compared with  is the fastest growing segment of our health care costs and now accounts for approximately of our total united states health care costs 
although we have taken measures to have salaried employees and retirees bear a higher portion of the costs of their health care benefits  we expect these trends to continue over the next several years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk overview we are exposed to a variety of market and other risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates  as well as risks to availability of funding sources  hazard events  and specific asset risks 
these risks affect our automotive and financial services sectors differently 
we monitor and manage these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which includes regular reports to a central management committee  the global risk management committee grmc 
the grmc is responsible for developing our overall risk management objectives and reviewing performance against these objectives 
the grmc is chaired by our chief financial officer  and its members include our treasurer  our controller  and the chief financial officer of ford credit 
our automotive and financial services sectors are exposed to liquidity risk  or the possibility of having to curtail their businesses or being unable to meet present and future financial obligations as they come due because funding sources may be reduced or become unavailable 
we  and particularly ford credit  which comprises substantially all of our financial services sector  maintain plans for sources of funding to ensure liquidity through a variety of economic or business cycles 
as discussed in greater detail in item  our funding sources include commercial paper  term debt  sale of receivables through securitization transactions  committed lines of credit from major banks  and other sources 
we are exposed to a variety of insurable risks  such as loss or damage to property  liability claims  and employee injury 
we protect against these risks through a combination of self insurance and the purchase of commercial insurance designed to protect against events that could generate significant losses 
direct responsibility for the execution of our market risk management strategies resides with our treasurer s office and is governed by written polices and procedures 
separation of duties is maintained between the development and authorization of derivative trades  the transaction of derivatives  and the settlement of cash flows 
regular audits are conducted to ensure that appropriate controls are in place and that they remain effective 
in addition  our market risk exposures and our use of derivatives to manage these exposures are reviewed by the grmc and the audit committee of our board of directors 
for additional information on our derivatives  see note of our notes to financial statements 
the market and counterparty risks of our automotive sector and ford credit are discussed and quantified below 
the quantitative disclosures presented are independent of any adjustments related to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
automotive market and counterparty risk our automotive sector frequently has expenditures and receipts denominated in foreign currencies  including the following purchases and sales of finished vehicles and production parts  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends  and investments in foreign operations 
these expenditures and receipts create exposures to changes in exchange rates 
we also are exposed to changes in prices of commodities used in our automotive sector and changes in interest rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued foreign currency risk and commodity risk are measured and quantified using a model to calculate the changes in the value of currency and commodity derivative instruments along with the underlying exposure being hedged 
beginning with this report  we have changed our risk disclosure methodology to an earnings at risk ear model from a value at risk var 
var is a valuation of the existing hedge portfolio and projects the potential change in the portfolio s liquidation value 
ear provides the potential impact to pre tax earnings related to foreign currency and commodity price exposure and is a more meaningful metric to an ongoing business than var 
the model to calculate ear combines current market data with historical data on volatilities and correlations of the underlying currencies and commodity prices 
ear includes hedging derivatives as well as the underlying exposures over a twelve month period 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the possibility that our financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use derivative instruments to hedge assets  liabilities  investments in foreign operations  and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in our hedging actions  we use primarily instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce foreign exchange risk eg  forward contracts and options 
our ear is based on transaction exposure  which is the foreign currency exposure that results from cross border cash flows from specific transactions  and our related hedging activity 
at december   the ear from foreign currency exchange movements over the next twelve months is less than million  within a confidence level  which is approximately million higher than the ear projection for calculated as of december  the increased exposure results primarily from less diversification benefit due to higher correlation among major currency pairings 
commodity price risk commodity price risk is the possibility of higher or lower costs due to changes in the prices of commodities  such as non ferrous eg  aluminum and precious metals eg  palladium  platinum and rhodium  ferrous alloys eg  steel  energy eg  natural gas and electricity  and plastics resins eg  polypropylene  which we use in the production of motor vehicles 
we use derivative instruments to hedge the price risk associated with the purchase of those commodities that we can economically hedge 
in our hedging actions  we primarily use instruments commonly used by corporations to reduce commodity price risk eg  financially settled forward contracts  swaps  and options 
based on our financial hedging activities with derivatives and the associated underlying exposures eg  precious metals  aluminum  copper  natural gas  and unleaded gas  at december   the ear from commodity price movements over the next twelve months is less than million  within a confidence level  which is approximately million lower than the ear projection for calculated as of december  the decreased exposure results primarily from declining consumption exposures and a lower cost basis 
in addition to these price hedging activities  our procurement activities ensure that we have adequate supplies of raw materials used in our business 
these procurement activities utilize forward purchase contracts  long term supply contracts  and stockpiles 
any price hedging inherent in our procurement activities is approved by the grmc 
interest rate risk interest rate risk relates to the gain or loss we could incur to our investment portfolio in the event of a change in interest rates 
we have billion in cash including assets contained in a veba trust  which we invest in securities of various types and maturities 
many of these securities are interest sensitive 
these securities are generally classified as trading or available for sale 
the trading portfolio gains and losses unrealized and realized are reported in the income statement 
the available for sale portfolio realized item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued gains or losses are reported in the income statement  and unrealized gains and losses are reported in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity in other comprehensive income 
the investment strategy is based on clearly defined risk and liquidity guidelines to maintain liquidity  minimize risk  and earn a reasonable return on the short term investment 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our trading and our available for sale portfolios 
as of december   the value of our trading portfolio was billion including assets contained in a veba trust  the value of our available for sale portfolio was billion  and the value of our cash and cash equivalents was billion 
assuming a hypothetical  instantaneous increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the value of our available for sale and trading portfolios would be reduced by million and million  respectively 
while this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenario  actual results could differ from those projected 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes interest rate changes are instantaneous  parallel shifts in the yield curve 
in reality  interest rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel 
counterparty risk counterparty risk relates to the loss we could incur if an obligor or counterparty defaulted on an investment or a derivative contract 
exposures primarily relate to investments in fixed income instruments and derivative contracts used for managing interest rate  currency and commodity risk 
we  together with ford credit  establish exposure limits for each counterparty to minimize risk and provide counterparty diversification 
our exposures are monitored on a regular basis and are included in monthly reporting to the grmc 
our approach to managing counterparty risk is forward looking and proactive  allowing us to take risk mitigation actions 
we establish exposure limits for both mark to market and future potential exposure  based on our overall risk tolerance and ratings based historical default probabilities 
the exposure limits are lower for lower rated counterparties and for longer dated exposures 
we use a monte carlo simulation technique to assess our potential exposure by tenor  defined at a confidence level 
substantially all of our counterparty and obligor exposures are with counterparties and obligors that are rated single a or better 
ford credit market risks overview ford credit is exposed to risks in the normal course of its business activities 
in addition to counterparty risk discussed above  ford credit is subject to the following additional types of risks that it seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures o market risk the possibility that changes in future market interest and currency exchange rates or prices will have an adverse impact on operating results 
o credit risk the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payments according to contract terms 
o residual risk the possibility that the actual proceeds received by ford credit upon the sale of returned lease vehicles at lease termination will be lower than its internal forecast of residual values 
o liquidity risk the possibility of being unable to meet all current and future obligations in a timely manner 
each form of risk is uniquely managed in the context of its contribution to ford credit s overall global risk

the following discusses ford credit s market risks foreign currency risk 
to meet funding objectives  ford credit issues debt or  for its international affiliates  draws on local credit lines in a variety of currencies 
ford credit faces exposure to currency exchange rates if a mismatch exists between the currency of its receivables and the currency of the debt funding those receivables 
when possible  receivables are funded with debt in the same currency  minimizing exposure to exchange rate movements 
when a different currency is used  ford credit seeks to minimize the impact of currency exchange rates on operating results by executing foreign currency derivatives 
these derivatives convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local country currency of the receivables 
as a result  ford credit s market risk exposure relating to currency exchange rates is believed to be immaterial 
interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk to which ford credit is exposed and consists principally of re pricing risk or differences in the re pricing characteristics of assets and liabilities 
an instrument s re pricing period is a term used by financial institutions to describe how an interest rate sensitive instrument responds to changes in interest rates 
it refers to the time it takes an instrument s interest rate to reflect a change in market interest rates 
for fixed rate instruments  the re pricing period is equal to the maturity for repayment of the instrument s principal because  with a fixed interest rate  the principal is considered to re price only when re invested in a new instrument 
for a floating rate instrument  the re pricing period is the period of time before the interest rate adjusts to the market rate 
for instance  a floating rate loan whose interest rate is reset to a market index annually on december st would have a re pricing period of one year on january st  regardless of the instrument s maturity 
ford credit s receivables consist primarily of fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts and floating rate wholesale receivables 
fixed rate retail installment sale and lease contracts are originated principally with maturities ranging between two and six years and generally require customers to make equal monthly payments over the life of the contract 
ford credit s funding sources consist primarily of short and long term unsecured debt and sales of receivables in securitizations 
in the case of unsecured term debt  and in an effort to have funds available throughout business cycles  ford credit often borrows longer term  with five to ten year maturities 
these debt instruments are principally fixed rate and require fixed and equal interest payments over the life of the instrument and a single principal payment at maturity 
ford credit is exposed to interest rate risk to the extent that a difference exists between the re pricing profile of its assets and debt 
specifically  without derivatives  ford credit s assets would re price more quickly than its debt 
ford credit s interest rate risk management objective is to maximize its financing margin while limiting fluctuations caused by changes in interest rates 
ford credit achieves this objective by setting an established risk tolerance range and staying within this tolerance range through an interest rate risk management program that includes entering into derivatives commonly known as interest rate swaps 
on a monthly basis  ford credit determines the sensitivity of the economic value of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities its economic value to hypothetical changes in interest rates 
economic value is a measure of the present value of all future expected cash flows  discounted by market interest rates  and is equal to the present value of interest rate sensitive assets minus the present value of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
ford credit then enters into interest rate swaps  effectively converting portions of its floating rate debt or assets to fixed or its fixed rate debt or assets to floating  to ensure that the sensitivity of its economic value falls within an established target range 
ford credit also monitors the sensitivity of its earnings to interest rates using earnings simulation techniques 
these simulations calculate the projected earnings of its portfolio of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities under various interest rate scenarios  including both parallel and non parallel shifts in the yield curve 
these quantifications of interest rate risk are included in monthly reporting to the grmc 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued the process described above is used to measure and manage the interest rate risk of ford credit s operations in the united states and canada  which together represented approximately of its total owned finance receivables at december  for its international affiliates  ford credit uses a technique commonly referred to as gap analysis  to measure re pricing mismatch 
this process uses re pricing schedules  which group assets  debt  and swaps into time bands based on their re pricing period 
under this process  ford credit enters into interest rate swaps  effectively changing the re pricing profile of its assets and debt  to ensure that any re pricing mismatch existing in a particular time band falls within an established tolerance 
as a result of its interest rate risk management process  including derivatives  ford credit s debt re prices slightly faster than its assets 
other things equal  this means that during a period of rising interest rates  the interest rates paid on ford credit s debt will increase more rapidly than the interest rates earned on assets  thereby initially reducing ford credit s earnings by a small amount 
correspondingly  during a period of falling interest rates  ford credit s earnings would be expected to initially increase by a small amount 
to provide a quantitative measure of the sensitivity of its earnings to changes in interest rates  ford credit uses interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical  instantaneous increase or decrease in interest rates of one percentage point across all maturities  as well as a base case that assumes that interest rates remain constant at existing levels 
the differences between these scenarios and the base case over a one year horizon represent an estimate of the sensitivity of ford credit s pre tax earnings over the following year 
this sensitivity as of year end and is as follows pre tax earnings impact given a pre tax earnings impact given a one percentage point increase in one percentage point decrease in interest rates in millions interest rates in millions december  december  while the sensitivity analysis presented is ford credit s best estimate of the impacts of specified assumed interest rate scenarios  actual results could differ from those projected 
the model used to conduct this analysis is heavily dependent on assumptions  particularly those regarding the reinvestment of maturing asset principal  refinancing of maturing debt  and predicted repayment of sale and lease contracts ahead of contractual maturity
