overview maritrans serves the petroleum and petroleum product distribution industry by using tank barges  tugboats and oil tankers to provide marine transportation services primarily along the gulf and atlantic coasts of the united states 
between and  the company has transported at least million barrels annually  with a high of million barrels in and a low of million barrels in maritrans sold vessels in resulting in a reduction in capacity 
in and  the company has transported million and million barrels  respectively 
many factors affect the number of barrels transported and may affect future results for maritrans 
such factors include the company s vessel and fleet size and average trip lengths  the continuation of federal law restricting united states point to point maritime shipping to us vessels the jones act  domestic oil consumption  environmental laws and regulations  oil companies decisions as to the type and origination point of the crude that it processes  changes in the amount of imported petroleum products  competition  labor and training costs and liability insurance costs 
overall us oil consumption during fluctuated between million and million barrels a day 
in  the company made several strategic moves in order to focus on those markets where it believes it possesses a long term competitive advantage and that should provide additional opportunities 
as a result  the company sold two small tug and barge units  which were working in puerto rico  two petroleum storage terminals in philadelphia  pennsylvania and salisbury  maryland  and twenty seven vessels working primarily in the northeastern united states 
before the sales  the sold vessels had transported approximately million barrels in and had represented approximately percent of revenues 
maritrans has successfully rebuilt four of its existing  single hulled  barges to a double hull design configuration  which complies with the provisions of the opa see table in legislation below 
the company intends to apply the same methodology to up to five more of its existing large  oceangoing  single hull barges 
the timing of the rebuilds will be determined by a number of factors  including market conditions  shipyard pricing and availability  customer requirements and opa retirement dates for the vessels 
the opa retirement dates fall between and each of the company s superbarges represent approximately to percent of the total fleet capacity  which will be removed from revenue generating service during the rebuilding of that vessel 
results of operations time charter equivalent tce is a commonly used industry measure where direct voyage costs are deducted from revenue 
maritrans enters into various types of charters  some of which involve the customer paying substantially all voyage costs  while other types of charters involve maritrans paying some or substantially all of the voyage costs 
the company monitors the tce basis because it essentially nets the voyage costs and voyage revenue to yield a measure that is comparable between periods regardless of the types of charters utilized 
the company began reporting on the tce basis in the first quarter of for comparison purposes  the following table lists the tce revenue for all quarters in and voyage revenue         voyage costs         time charter equivalent         year ended december  compared with year ended december  tce revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is as follows voyage revenue   voyage costs   time charter equivalent   tce revenue increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent 
vessel utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  decreased from percent for the year ended december  to percent for the year ended december  utilization decreased due to more vessel out of service time in the year ended december  as a result of vessels being taken out of service for maintenance 
in late may  the ocean went out of service for her double hull rebuild and re entered service in the fourth quarter of in addition  the maritrans was out of service in the beginning of while her double hull rebuild was being completed 
she re entered service in the first quarter of term contract rates renewed with customers in were renewed at higher levels than those experienced in on long term contracts 
the increase in these rates resulted from a more stable supply demand relationship in the jones act trade 
these rate increases had a positive impact on revenue and helped to offset the weak spot market 
spot market rates were significantly lower in than in as a result of the following factors 
warm weather in the early part of in the northeast reduced the demand for heating oil resulting in excess distillate inventory through most of the year 
the cold weather in the northeast in the fourth quarter of increased heating oil demand  but that demand was met mostly by the high inventories and imports from europe 
saw a continued reduction in the demand for jet fuel  which began with the terrorist attack of september th and continued throughout the year 
gasoline demand remained high throughout this demand was met primarily from increased imports from europe as their sluggish economy reduced their internal demand 
refined product imports typically reduce demand for the company s services by diminishing the need for us gulf refineries to supply product to the atlantic coast 
the company believes the spot market will continue to be fairly soft through much of due to all these factors 
the company believes that a european economic recovery would have a positive impact on rates by reducing refined product imports into our market 
it is uncertain at this time what the impact of a continued strike of the venezuelan oil industry or a war with iraq would have on the company s revenue 
barrels of cargo transported decreased from million in the year ended december  to million in the year ended december   due to decreases in demand and utilization as discussed above 
voyage costs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or percent 
the primary decrease in voyage costs was in fuel costs  which resulted from the downturn in the economy in the later part of and continued in the average price per gallon of fuel decreased approximately percent in compared to total costs and operating expenses  excluding voyage costs discussed above  increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or percent 
routine maintenance expenses incurred during voyages and in port have declined in compared to  while expenditure levels for maintenance incurred in shipyards has increased 
this reflects efforts being made to meet increased regulatory and customer vetting requirements and rising shipyard costs 
these shipyard expenses are expected to continue to increase and the company has adjusted the shipyard accrual rate to meet these increased costs 
in addition  insurance costs increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as the result of increased premiums charged by the insurance companies on policies renewed and to additional deductible amounts paid in the current year 
seagoing salary increases  which took effect early in  increased crew costs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  professional fees increased in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  for consulting fees incurred to review port security and other security issues 
general and administrative expenses increased due to increased professional fees including higher litigation and consulting costs for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  litigation costs and professional fees arose from both immaterial litigation arising in the ordinary course of business and the legal proceedings described in part ii item of this form k 
in addition  the company experienced increased premiums charged by the insurance companies on the directors and officers policy renewed in operating income decreased as a result of the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
interest expense for the year ended december  of million decreased compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the refinancing of debt that took place in the fourth quarter of the new debt has a variable interest rate  which is lower than the fixed interest rate of percent on most of the previously held debt and therefore resulted in decreased interest expense when compared to interest and other income for the year ended december  was million compared to interest and other income for the year ended december  of million 
other income is made up primarily of interest income 
interest income decreased due to a lower amount of cash invested in compared to the decrease in the average cash balance is primarily the result of the debt refinancing discussed above 
other income in the year ended december  includes both a million litigation settlement received and a charge of million for a litigation settlement to be paid in see item legal proceedings 
other income in the year ended december  includes a pre tax gain of million on the sale of a barge 
net income for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december  due to the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenues for of million were consistent with revenues for of million 
vessel utilization  as measured by revenue days divided by calendar days available  decreased from percent in to percent in utilization decreased due to more vessel out of service time for maintenance in compared to in  the maritrans was out of service for nine months for her double hull rebuild 
the maritrans went out of service for her double hull rebuild late in the second quarter of and re entered service early in february as a result  the fleet lost less days to double hull rebuilding in than in  offsetting the maintenance out of service time 
term contract rates renewed with customers in were renewed at higher levels than those experienced in the increase in these rates resulted from a more stable supply demand relationship in the jones act trade 
spot market rates fluctuated greatly in  and overall were slightly higher than in in the first half of the year  spot rates were significantly higher than the same period in due to increased distillate demand and the restocking of inventory balances 
in the third quarter  spot rates dropped as a result of refinery maintenance projects and less demand for refined products 
in addition  there was a general downturn in the economy  which continued through the end of the year 
in the fourth quarter  spot rates declined to below levels for the comparable period 
the terrorists attacks on september th worsened the downturn in the economy 
as a result  gasoline inventories grew and the demand for jet fuel decreased 
in addition  warm weather in the northeast reduced the demand for heating oil 
barrels of cargo transported decreased from million in to million in  due to decreases in demand during the year 
total costs and operating expenses for were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
the primary decreases in operating expenses were in voyage costs  which are primarily fuel consumed and port charges incurred 
in more of the company s tankers were under contracts that pass all fuel and other voyage costs directly to the customer than in  resulting in a decrease in expenses 
the downturn in the economy in  discussed above  also reduced fuel prices 
the average price per gallon of fuel decreased percent compared to the decrease in utilization  discussed above  also caused port charges and fuel costs to decrease compared to the same period in offsetting these decreases was an increase in crew costs 
in  a higher volume of seminars and training took place than in routine maintenance increased during as a result of a higher number of vessel repairs 
other maintenance expenses decreased due to the extensive renewals and refurbishments that occur during the rebuilding of the single hulled barges to double hulled barges 
in  the company had incurred million in relocation costs as a result of moving the corporate headquarters from philadelphia  pennsylvania to tampa  florida  which were not incurred in operating income increased from million in to million in  as a result of the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
interest and other income in included interest income of million and a gain of million on the sale of a barge 
interest and other income in included interest income of million offset by a loss of million on the sale of philadelphia real estate and equipment 
interest income decreased due to a lower amount of cash invested in compared to the extraordinary loss of million  net of taxes  resulted from prepayment penalties and the write off of unamortized financing costs on the prepayment of the company s fleet mortgage 
net income increased from million for the twelve months ended december  to million for the twelve months ended december  this increase was due to the aforementioned changes in revenue and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources in  net cash provided by operating activities was million 
these funds  augmented by the company s credit facility  were sufficient to meet debt service obligations and loan agreement restrictions  to make capital acquisitions and improvements and to allow maritrans inc to pay a dividend in the current quarter

critical accounting policies maintenance and repairs provision is made for the cost of upcoming major periodic overhauls of vessels and equipment in advance of performing the related maintenance and repairs 
based on the company s methodology  approximately one third of this estimated cost is included in accrued shipyard costs as a current liability with the remainder classified as long term 
although the timing of the actual disbursements have fluctuated over the years  particularly as a result of changes in the size of the fleet and timing of the large maintenance projects  the classification has been in line with the actual disbursements over time 
the company believes that providing for such overhauls in advance of performing the related maintenance and repairs provides a more appropriate view of the financial position of the company at any point in time 
in september  the rule making body of the aicpa issued an exposure draft on a statement of position  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment the proposed statement 
this group  referred to as acsec  recently decided that it will no longer issue accounting guidance and planned to transition the majority of its projects to the fasb 
however  the fasb subsequently requested that acsec address certain portions of the proposed statement in smaller scope projects 
the fasb expressed their concern that the project would not be completed timely  by acsec or the fasb  if the scope of the project was not reduced 
at this time  it is unclear whether the proposed statement will be issued or in what form 
if the existing proposed statement is issued  it would require the company to modify its accounting policy for maintenance and repairs 
such costs would no longer be accrued in advance of performing the related maintenance and repairs  rather  the proposed statement requires these costs to be capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
the company has not yet quantified the impact of adopting the proposed statement on its financial statements  however  the company s preliminary assessment is that the adoption of this pronouncement would increase the value of vessels and equipment  decrease the shipyard accrual and increase stockholders equity of the company 
market risk the principal market risk to which the company is exposed is a change in interest rates on debt instruments 
the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable rate debt

the information below summarizes the company s market risks associated with its debt obligations and should be read in conjunction with note of the consolidated financial statements

the company was not required to record an impairment charge based on its test 
the test required estimates  assumptions and judgments and results could be materially different if different estimates  assumptions and judgments had been used 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections sfas 
sfas requires  among other things  gains or losses on extinguishment of debt to be classified as income loss from continuing operations rather than as an extraordinary item  unless such extinguishment is determined to be extraordinary pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring transactions opinion 
the provisions of sfas related to the rescission of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in opinion for classification as an extraordinary item must be reclassified 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas beginning january  and accordingly  will reclassify the loss of million on the retirement of debt during the year ended december   from an extraordinary item to a separate component of income before taxes 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement no

in addition  sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december   with certain disclosure requirements effective for interim periods beginning after december  accordingly  the company has disclosed the required provisions in its notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  in addition  the company will adopt the transition provisions of sfas using the prospective method beginning january  the prospective method requires the company to recognize the fair value of all employee stock awards in its consolidated financial statements of income beginning on the date of adoption 
if the company had adopted sfas using the prospective method on january   diluted earnings per share would have been lower by 
for the year ended december  the company is currently unable to quantify the effect of adoption on earnings per share for the year ended december   as actual information such as stock price  fair value  and number of shares outstanding is unknown
