introduction the following is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of the operations of unizan financial corp 
the reported results of the company primarily reflect the operations of the company s bank subsidiary 
the company s results of operations are dependent on a variety of factors  including the general interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the industry  governmental policies and regulations and conditions in the markets for financial assets 
like most financial institutions  the primary contributor to the company s income is net interest income  which is defined as the difference between the interest the company earns on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest the company pays on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company s operations are also affected by non interest income  such as checking account and trust fees and gains from sales of loans 
the company s principal operating expenses  aside from interest expense  consist of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy costs  and other general and administrative expenses 
unizan financial corp

and unb corp 
that was completed on march  bancfirst ohio corp

total assets added from this merger approximated billion 
on june   the company completed the acquisition of milton 
in connection with the acquisition  the company issued  common shares having a total value of approximately million and paid cash of million to milton s shareholders

table of contents net interest income net interest income  the primary source of earnings for the company  is the difference between interest and loan fee income generated on interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
for this discussion  net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis which restates interest on tax exempt securities and loans as if such interest was subject to federal income tax at the statutory rate 
for  net interest income increased to  from  in and from  in in  the increase in the net interest income was attributed to the growth in average interest earning assets due to the merger with unb corp 
the yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points which was offset by a basis point reduction in the cost of funds 
the company tries to maintain a neutral interest rate risk position to minimize the impact of changes in rates on net interest income and the net interest margin 
if rates continue to decline in  the net interest margin is likely to decline 
borrowers will have the option to prepay or refinance existing loans  but the company will have less opportunity to decrease rates on deposits since they are near historical lows 
if rates increase  variable rate loans will reprice upward  but could be offset by similar increases in deposit rates  resulting in a flat to declining net interest margin rate 
loan fees in the amount of million  million and million were included in interest on loans for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net interest margin  the measure of the net yield on average interest earning assets on a fte basis  is calculated by dividing net interest income on a fte basis by average interest earning assets 
the following table presents  for each period indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the resultant yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and percentage rates  and the net interest margin 
the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of interest earning assets  the proportion funded by non interest versus interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread between them 
all average balances are average daily balances 
non accruing loans are included in average loan balances

table of contents the company s net interest margin increased by basis points to in from in  and by basis points from the net interest margin rate of 
the improvement in the net interest margin in was primarily from lower cost of funds due to the decline in market interest rates and due to a change in funding mix as a result of the merger 
in  the net interest margin benefited from declines in market interest rates combined with the maturity of higher yielding certificates of deposit 
net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense 
the following table discloses the dollar changes in the company s net interest income attributable to changes in levels of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities volume  changes in average yields on interest earning assets and average rates on interest bearing liabilities rate and the combined volume and rate effects total 
for the purposes of this table  the change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to volume and rate change in proportion to the relationship of the dollar amounts of the change in each

these increases were partially offset by an impairment charge of  on the mortgage servicing asset as the decline in interest rates and the corresponding acceleration in mortgage pre payment speeds continued 
future impairment could be realized if pre payment speeds increase beyond the assumption rates 
if rates begin to rise and pre payment activity slows  the value of the servicing rights should be positively impacted

table of contents asset quality to maintain the level of credit risk of the loan portfolio at an appropriate level  management sets underwriting standards and internal lending limits and provides for proper diversification of the portfolio by placing constraints on the concentration of credits within the portfolio 
in monitoring the level of credit risk within the loan portfolio  management utilizes a formal loan review process to monitor  review  and consider relevant factors in evaluating specific credits in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company formally documents its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and the evaluations are reviewed and discussed with its board of directors 
failure to receive principal and interest payments when due on any loan results in efforts to restore such loan to current status 
loans are classified as non accrual when  in the opinion of management  full collection of principal and accrued interest is in doubt 
the loans must be brought current and kept current for six consecutive months before being considered for removal from non accrual status 
continued unsuccessful collection efforts generally lead to initiation of foreclosure or other legal proceedings 
property acquired by the company as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as other assets owned until such time as it is sold or otherwise disposed of 
the company owned  of such property at december  and  at december  when loans are charged off  any accrued interest recorded in the current fiscal year is charged against interest income 
the remaining balance is treated as a loan charge off 
non performing loans totaled  or of total loans  at december   compared to  or of total loans  at year end non performing assets totaled  or of total assets at december   compared to  or of total assets  at december  the increase in non performing loans was primarily attributed to loans added by the merger with unb corp 
the increase in non performing loans was also attributed to non performing commercial and commercial real estate loans which totaled  at december   compared to  at december  which resulted from delinquency trends in general 
management of the company is not aware of any material amounts of loans outstanding  not disclosed in the table below  for which there is significant uncertainty as to the ability of the borrower to comply with present payment terms 
the following is an analysis of the composition of non performing assets in thousands of dollars non accrual loans loans past due days and still accruing total non performing loans other assets owned total non performing assets restructured loans restructured loans consist of one loan that was restructured in may at december   this loan was performing in accordance with its restructured terms 
the restructured loan is not included in non performing assets 
for the year ended december   of interest income would have been earned under the original terms on those loans classified as non accrual at december  had they been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination 
at december   loans totaling  were classified as impaired loans and  not classified as impaired or non performing  were classified as potential problem loans 
potential problem loans include loans which management has some doubt as to the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms and loans which management is actively monitoring due to changes in the borrowers financial condition 
impaired loans  non performing loans and potential problem loans have been considered in management s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents provision and allowance for loan losses management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses within the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is the amount necessary  in the opinion of management  to maintain the balance in the allowance for loan losses at an adequate level 
adequacy of the allowance is assessed based on historical experience  changes in portfolio size and mix  the relative quality of the loan portfolio  current and anticipated loan growth and economic conditions 
information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position and collateral values  are also important as well as assessments of current and future economic conditions  and other factors and estimates  which are subject to change over time 
while management s periodic analysis of the allowance for loan losses may dictate portions of the allowance be allocated to specific problem loans  the entire amount is available for any loan charge offs that may occur 
the following table summarizes the company s loan loss experience  and provides a breakdown of the charge off  recovery and other activity for the periods indicated in thousands of dollars average loans outstanding during the period allowance for loan losses at beginning of year loans charged off commercial and commercial real estate aviation residential real estate consumer loans total charge offs recoveries commercial and commercial real estate aviation residential real estate consumer loans total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses charged to operations acquired allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses at end of year ratio of net charge offs to average loans  net of unearned income the allowance for loan losses at december  was  compared to  at year end  which represented and of outstanding loans for and  respectively 
the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense was  in  compared to  in and  in the increase in provision in was primarily the result of the company s review of general economic conditions and uncertainties  a continual analysis of the company s loan portfolio  increased charge offs and due to the increase in the size of the loan portfolio due to the merger 
the increase in provision for loan losses for the year ended also increased as a result of the company adopting the allowance for loan loss methodology of unb corp 
it is common for merged companies to adopt one set of policies and as a result the calculation called for a higher provision amount during this led to an increase in specific allocations recognized based on deterioration in credit quality of specific credits and an increase in the non specific allocation based on management s analysis of current economic conditions and portfolio trends 
net charge offs for increased by  from  to  and increased by from to  to  the ratio of net charge offs as a percentage of average loans outstanding was  and for  and  respectively 

table of contents the allowance for loan losses is allocated according to the amount systematically estimated as necessary to provide for the inherent losses within the various categories of loans 
general allocations of the allowance are based primarily on previous charge off experience adjusted for changes in the risk characteristics of each category 
in addition  classified and non performing loans are evaluated separately and specific reserves are allocated based on probable losses for each individual classified or non performing loan

total loans on the balance sheet were comprised of the following classifications at december  commercial commercial real estate aircraft residential real estate consumer loans total loans excluding loans added by the merger with unb corp  commercial loans increased by million  commercial real estate increased by million and home equity loans increased by million 
these increases were offset by a million decline in residential mortgage loans as historically low interest rates 
table of contents contributed to record refinancing 
as mortgage loans were refinanced at relatively low long term fixed rates  unizan chose to sell them in the secondary market 
for  management has set goals stressing continued loan growth in the commercial  commercial real estate  aircraft  consumer and home equity products 
in all segments of the portfolio  growth with high credit quality and acceptable yields will be stressed  while limiting exposure to interest rate risk 
management has made the decision to portfolio mortgage loans in the first quarter of this is a strategy that management will continue to evaluate based on the company s liquidity and interest rate risk position 
the following is a schedule of contractual maturities and repayments  excluding residential real estate mortgage and consumer loans  as of december  commercial  commercial real estate and aircraft loans due in one year or less due after one year  but within five years due after five years total the following is a schedule of fixed and variable rate commercial  commercial real estate and aircraft loans due after one year variable rate loans are loans with floating or adjustable interest rates fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commercial  commercial real estate and aircraft loans due after one year securities the securities portfolio serves a primary role in the overall context of balance sheet management by the company 
the company s general investment strategy is to manage the portfolio to include rate sensitive assets  matched against rate sensitive liabilities to reduce interest rate risk 
in recognition of this strategy  as well as to provide a secondary source of liquidity to accommodate loan demand and possible deposit withdrawals  the company has chosen to classify the majority of its securities as available for sale

approximated million 
the remaining increase is attributed to an increase in the funds invested in the securities portfolio from liquidity generated by the repayment of loans and by funds generated through deposit campaigns 
management s strategy in has been to maintain a defensive position within the portfolio to offset the future effects of a liability sensitive balance sheet by investing in securities with an average duration of three years or less

were approximately million 
also contributing to the increase in deposits was an offering of long term certificates of deposits at slightly above market rates which brought in approximately million in new deposits during the third quarter of management wanted to lock in these rates as part of its balance sheet strategy to mitigate its exposure to possible increases in rates 
management believes it was prudent to extend liabilities at a time of record low rates  even though it now appears that rates may not increase as soon as originally anticipated 
the company continues to emphasize growth in its existing retail deposit base  provided incremental deposit growth is cost effective compared to alternative funding sources 
total interest bearing deposits accounted for of total deposits at december   compared to at december  borrowings short term borrowings of million consist of sweep repurchase agreements added from the merger with unb corp 
other borrowings increased million to million at december   compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to the merger with unb corp 
this increase was partially offset by the payoff of a million term loan 
on october   the company completed an offering of million aggregate liquidation amount of capital securities  series a  due these securities represent preferred beneficial interests in bfoh capital trust i  a special purpose trust formed for the purpose of the offering 
the proceeds from the offering were used by the trust to purchase junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures debentures from the company

the merger with unb corp 
contributed million to shareholders equity 
shareholders equity also increased by net income of million  an increase of million  in other comprehensive income and these increases were partially offset by cash dividends paid of million 
the company s board of directors has approved a stock repurchase program authorizing management to repurchase up to  common shares

cash dividends paid to shareholders during totaled  or per share 
this compared to  or per share  for dividends paid in represented a payout ratio of of net income compared to in under regulations issued by the federal reserve and comptroller of the currency  banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain certain minimum capital ratios in order to be considered well capitalized 
these guidelines require a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  a tier capital ratio of and leverage ratio of 
all of the company s assets  which include various risk weighted percentages of assets on the balance sheet  as well as off balance sheet exposures  are expressed as a percentage of risk adjusted assets and compared to its capital 
tier capital consists of shareholders equity and other items such as mandatory convertible debt and the allowance for loan losses 
as of december   unizan financial corp 
had a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier capital ratio of 
both of these risk based capital ratios are well above minimum regulatory requirements 
in addition to risk based capital  a leverage ratio test must also be met 
this ratio evaluates capital adequacy on the basis of tier capital to total assets unadjusted for risk 
on december   unizan financial corp 
s leverage ratio was  which substantially exceeds the company s minimum regulatory requirement 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to interest rate risk caused by the differences in cash flows and repricing characteristics that occur in various assets and liabilities as a result of changes in interest rates 
the asset and liability management process is designed to measure and manage that risk to maintain consistent levels of net interest income and net present value of equity under any interest rate scenario 
the company uses a dynamic computer model to generate earnings simulations  duration and net present value forecasts and gap analyses  each of which measures interest rate risk from a different perspective 
the model incorporates a large number of assumptions  including the absolute level of future interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  various spread relationships  prepayment speeds  repricing opportunities  cash flow characteristics of instruments without contractual maturity dates and changes in the volumes of multiple loan  investment and deposit categories 
management believes that individually  and in the aggregate  these assumptions are reasonable  but the complexity of the simulation modeling process results in a sophisticated estimate  not a precise calculation of exposure 
one of the most significant assumptions is the assignment of deposit balances without a stated maturity date to specific time frames 
since these deposits are subject to withdrawal on demand  and have rates that can be changed at any time  they could be considered immediately repriceable and assigned to the shortest maturity  resulting in a significant level of liability sensitivity 
however  actual practice indicates that balances are withdrawn and replaced over a much longer time frame  and rates are modified less frequently and in smaller increments than changes which occur in financial market rates 
although the company prefers to use a statistical analysis of historical deposit behavior to derive appropriate distributions of deposit balances over the simulation time horizon  in the current data non maturity deposits are assigned a one month maturity 
the deposits of the new company will be reanalyzed to provide a more accurate depiction of interest rate risk 

table of contents the model then applies a predetermined immediate parallel increase or decrease in the level of interest rates to forecast the impact on both net interest income and capital one year forward 
while this methodology provides a comprehensive appraisal of interest rate risk  it is not necessarily indicative of actual or expected financial performance 
changes in interest rates that affect the entire yield curve equally at a single point in time are not typical 
the residential mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on industry medians and could differ from the company s actual results due to non financial prepayment incentives and other local factors 
the behavior of depositors is based on an analysis of historical changes in balances and might not fully reflect current attitudes toward other investment alternatives 
moreover  the model does not include any interim changes in strategy the company might initiate in response to shifts in interest rates 
at december   assuming an immediate  parallel basis point shift in market yields  the company s net interest income for the next twelve months was calculated to decrease by approximately if rates fell and decrease by if rates rose 
since interest rates on deposit products are very low  the company would not realize any significant future benefit from lower rates  but could see a continuing decrease in earning asset rates 
the net present value of equity is defined as the difference between the present value of the company s assets and liabilities 
in general  the present value of fixed rate financial instruments declines as market rate increase and increases as rates fall 
using the yield scenario defined above  the net present value of equity was forecasted to decline by in a rising rate environment and to rise by in a falling rate scenario 
the duration of total assets was months  compared to a duration of total liabilities of months  indicating that liabilities will both reprice faster than assets and change in value by a smaller amount than the assets over a similar time frame 
interest rate risk can be managed by using a variety of techniques  including selling existing assets or repaying liabilities  pricing loans and deposits to attract preferred maturities and developing alternative sources of funding or structuring new products to hedge existing exposures 
in addition to these balance sheet strategies  the company can also use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps  and floors to minimize the potential impact of adverse changes in interest rates 
at december   the company has three interest rate swaps on which it pays a fixed rate and receives a variable rate 
one swap with a current notional amount of  was executed as a hedge against fixed rate mortgages which are held in the company s portfolio 
the net cash flow and market value of the swap move inversely with those of the fixed rate loans in the portfolio  which reduces the company s exposure to changing interest rates 
if rates rise  the company receives net cash flow from the swap which compensates for the opportunity loss of holding an asset with a below market yield 
if rates fall  the net cash flows given up are offset by the increased value of assets with an above market yield 
the gain that would be realized on the sale of the loans would counteract the loss on the termination of the interest rate swap 
the swap is recorded at a fair value of  with changes recognized in current income which amounted to income of in the other two swaps with a total notional of  were executed to convert variable rate borrowings to a fixed rate  to reduce the risk of increased interest expense in a rising rate environment 
they are recorded at a fair value of  with changes recognized in other comprehensive income 
the company also has a notional balance of  of options on the s p which offsets the equivalent risk of certificate of deposit liabilities that have a return contractually linked to the index 
the purchased options and the derivative embedded in the certificate substantially offset each other and are carried at a fair value  with changes recognized in income 
during and  the company recognized and  respectively  in expense as a result of changes in fair value not precisely offsetting each other

table of contents liquidity management the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the availability of funds to accommodate customer loan demand as well as deposit withdrawals while continuously seeking higher yields from longer term lending and investing opportunities 
this is accomplished principally by maintaining sufficient cash flows and liquid assets along with consistent stable core deposits and the capacity to maintain immediate access to funds 
principal sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold and the cash flows provided by maturities and amortizations in the loan and securities portfolios 
the ability to raise funds in the market place is provided through the bank s branch network  in addition to the availability of fhlb advance borrowings  brokered deposits  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase and bank borrowings 
an important factor in the preservation of liquidity is the maintenance of public confidence  as this facilitates the retention and growth of a large  stable supply of core deposits 
considering the company s capital adequacy  profitability  available liquidity sources and funding sources  the company s liquidity is considered by management to be adequate to meet current and projected needs 
the company s principal source of funds to satisfy short term liquidity needs comes from cash  due from banks and federal funds sold 
the securities portfolio serves as an additional source of liquidity for the company 
at december   securities with a market value of  were classified as available for sale  representing of the total securities portfolio 
classification of securities as available for sale provides for flexibility in managing net interest margin  interest rate risk and liquidity 
cash flows from operating activities amounted to  and  for and  respectively 
the company s bank subsidiary is a member of the fhlb 
membership provides an opportunity to control the bank s cost of funds by providing alternative funding sources  to provide flexibility in the management of interest rate risk through the wide range of available funding sources  to manage liquidity via immediate access to such funds  and to provide flexibility through utilization of customized funding products to fund various loan and investment products and strategies 
during  the company s strategy was to increase liquidity and reduce interest rate risk 
during the historically low market interest rate and high refinancing environment that existed during  the company sold long term fixed rate mortgage loan production rather than retain the loans in its portfolio 
while this generated a gain on sale of mortgage loans of million  it also had a negative impact on the margin as higher rate assets left the balance sheet 
the bank also offered long term certificates of deposits which brought in million in new money 
management wanted to lock in low rates as part of its balance sheet strategy to mitigate its exposure to possible rate increases 
this put pressure on the net interest margin due to the incremental cost of these funds compared with shorter term liabilities available at lower market rates
