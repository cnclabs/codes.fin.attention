insurance although we believe our properties are adequately covered by insurance  we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain full coverage at a reasonable cost in the future 
the costs associated with our june  property and casualty insurance renewals were higher than anticipated 
although we have an excellent claims history and safety record  all lines of coverage were affected by higher premiums  in part because insurance companies have experienced a loss of income on their investments  underwriting results have been poor and also as a result of the events of september  our insurance renewal on june  increased premiums from the prior year approximately 
the property insurance deductible increased from  to  per claim 
since reinsurance treaties renew twice each year january and july  our property and casualty insurance renewal date has been changed from june to may to enable underwriters to concentrate on the insurance proposals well ahead of treaty renewal 
in  all risk property insurers began attaching terrorism exclusions to insurance policies 
as a result of the terrorism risk insurance act of  terrorism insurance must now be priced separately within the property insurance coverage 
unlike earthquake exposure  insurers do not yet have a means of modeling the terrorism risk 
during  we completed an in depth evaluation of our terrorism exposure as well as our lender requirements 
upon our renewal date for insurance of june   we purchased terrorism coverage with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate  with a deductible of million per claim  at a cost of approximately million per year 
the policy covers only physical damage and our amount of coverage may not be enough for all damages that could result from a terrorist attack 
coverage does not include losses due to biological  chemical or radioactive contamination 
the lack of coverage for such contamination could have a material adverse effect on our financial results if a building we own becomes uninhabitable as a result of biological  chemical  radioactive or other contamination

item legal proceedings we are currently involved in two separate lawsuits with two stockholders of hq global 
the first lawsuit involves the september conversion of an approximately million loan that we made to hq global into stock of hq global 
we  along with hq global  initiated this lawsuit in the united states district court for the district of columbia in february  asking the court to declare that the terms of the debt conversion were fair  after two minority stockholders threatened to challenge the terms of the conversion 
these stockholders had claimed that both the conversion price used and the methods by which the conversion price was agreed upon between hq global and us were not fair to hq global or these stockholders 
thereafter  these two stockholders filed their own counterclaims against hq global  the board of directors of hq global and us 
the stockholders asked the court to declare the conversion void  or in the alternative for compensatory and punitive damages 
on september   the trial court granted these stockholders motion for summary judgment  declaring that the shares issued in connection with the conversion were null and void 
we believe that the trial court incorrectly interpreted delaware law in this case 
we appealed this decision on october  we recognize that  in light of the trial court s finding  there is a reasonable possibility that we will be unsuccessful in overturning the court s decision 
in that event  there are a number of possible outcomes  including a reduction in our equity interest in hq global or a cash payment by us to these stockholders 
we currently believe that the value of any loss we may incur in this matter should not exceed million  including losses under the directors indemnification discussed below  although we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
the second lawsuit involves claims filed by these two stockholders in april arising out of the june merger transaction involving hq global and vantas incorporated 
in this lawsuit  these two stockholders have brought claims against hq global  the board of directors of hq global  frontline capital group and us in delaware chancery court 
the two stockholders allege that  in connection with the merger transaction  we breached our fiduciary duties to the two stockholders and breached a contract with the stockholders 
the claim relates principally to the allocation of consideration paid to us with respect to our interest in an affiliate of hq global that conducts international executive suites operations 
the stockholders asked the court to rescind the transaction  or in the alternative for compensatory and rescissory damages 
the court recently determined that it would not rescind the merger transaction  but held open the possibility that compensatory damages could be awarded or that another equitable remedy might be available 
we believe that these claims are without merit and that we will ultimately prevail in this action  although we cannot assure you that the court will not find in favor of these stockholders 
we continue to believe  however  that  even if the court finds in favor of these stockholders  any such adverse result will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in connection with the hq global vantas merger transaction  we agreed to indemnify all of the individuals who served as directors of hq global at the time of the transaction  including thomas carr  oliver carr and philip hawkins  who currently serve as directors and or executive officers of us  with respect to any losses incurred by them arising out of the above litigation matters  if they first tried and were unsuccessful in getting the losses reimbursed by hq global or from insurance proceeds 
it was expected at the time that these former directors would be indemnified against any of these losses by hq global  as required by hq global s certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
hq global has not satisfied its indemnity obligation to these directors  and in light of hq global s bankruptcy filing in march  is not likely to do so in the future 
as a result  we have paid the costs incurred by these directors in connection with the above litigation matters 
as of december   we had paid approximately  of costs pursuant to this indemnification arrangement  all of which represents amounts paid to legal counsel for these directors 
we are currently involved in two lawsuits arising out of a sublease entered into by hq global in march and our guarantee to the landlord of the performance of hq global s obligations under the sublease 
on march  hq global filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware 
in its bankruptcy proceedings  hq global rejected the sublease effective april  in june  we received a demand for payment by the landlord of the full amount of the guarantee approximately million of rent payments remain under the sublease 
we believe  however  that we have defenses to making payment under the guarantee and therefore joined with hq global in filing suit on july  in hq global s bankruptcy proceedings asking the bankruptcy court to declare that the sublease was terminated not later than february  in february  hq global  with the knowledge of the landlord  vacated the space it was subleasing and surrendered possession of the space to the landlord 
the landlord then began utilizing the space for its own benefit  as a storage and staging area related to construction the landlord was performing on other space it occupied 
we believe that the landlord s use of the space effectively terminated the sublease as a matter of law and that therefore we have no obligation to make payments under the guarantee 
on july   the landlord under the sublease filed suit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york seeking payment from us under the guarantee 
the district court in new york ruled that the bankruptcy court should determine which of the two courts should decide this dispute 
the bankruptcy court has not yet decided that issue 
in light of our defenses and these proceedings  we have not accrued any expense relating to this guarantee  however  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the pending litigation or that we will not incur expense or be required to make cash payments relating to this guarantee up to the full amount of the guarantee 
as of december   we had not made any payments under this guarantee 
however  even if the landlord were successful in its claims  we do not believe that this result would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are party to a variety of other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
all of these matters  taken together  are not expected to have a material adverse impact on us

part ii item market for registrant s common equity related stockholder matters our common stock is listed on the new york stock exchange nyse under the symbol cre 
as of december   there were stockholders of record 
the following table sets forth the high and low sale prices of our common stock as reported on the nyse composite tape  and the dividends paid per share of common stock for each quarterly period for the past two years 
q q q q full year high low dividend q q q q full year high low dividend in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to make ordinary dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the amount of these distributions must equal at least i 
the sum of a of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and b of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus ii 
the sum of certain non cash income items 
our strategy is to distribute what we believe is a conservative percentage of our cash flow 
this permits us to retain funds for capital improvements and other investments while funding our distributions 
for federal income tax purposes  distributions may consist of ordinary income  capital gains  nontaxable return of capital or a combination of those items 
distributions that exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits calculated for tax purposes constitute a return of capital rather than a dividend  which reduces a stockholder s basis in the shares of common stock and will not be taxable to the extent that the distribution equals or is less than the stockholder s basis in the stock 
to the extent a distribution exceeds both current and accumulated earnings and profits and the stockholder s basis in the stock  that distribution will be treated as a gain from the sale or exchange of that stockholder s shares 
every year  we notify stockholders of the taxability of distributions paid during the preceding year 
the following table sets forth the approximate taxability of common stock distributions paid in  and ordinary income capital gain see item of this annual report on form k  security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management  for certain information regarding our equity compensation plans 
item selected financial data the following table sets forth selected financial and operating information 
the financial and operating data have been derived from our consolidated financial statements for each of the periods presented 
the following selected financial and operating information should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k in thousands  except per share data year ended december  operating data real estate operating revenue from continuing operations rental revenue real estate service revenue income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax dividends paid to common stockholders share and per share data basic income from continuing operations diluted income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations diluted gain on sale of discontinued operations diluted dividends paid to common shareholders weighted average shares outstanding basic weighted average shares outstanding diluted in thousands as of or for the year ended december  balance sheet data real estate  before accumulated depreciation total assets mortgages and notes payable minority interest total stockholders equity total common shares outstanding other data net cash provided by operating activities net cash used by provided by investing activities net cash used by provided by financing activities funds from operations before allocation to the unitholders net income from continuing operations includes a non recurring gain loss of million and million related to a treasury lock agreement in and  respectively 
in  we sold an operating property whose operations and gain are classified as discontinued operations for all years presented except when the property was not in operation 
for the years   discontinued operations also includes hq global 
we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the operating performance of an equity reit 
along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  funds from operations provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable operating properties and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
our funds from operations for the years excludes discontinued operations related to hq global 
our funds from operations may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently from us 
funds from operations does not represent net income or cash flow generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and  as such  should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to make distributions 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion that follows is based primarily on our consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for the years ended december   and and should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the ability to compare one period to another may be significantly affected by acquisitions completed  development properties placed in service and dispositions made during those years 
the number of operating office buildings that we owned and were consolidated in the financial statements were in  in and in general during  we completed the following significant transactions we issued million of senior unsecured notes in january  million of senior unsecured notes in november and million of senior unsecured notes in november we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of million and million which hedge certain senior unsecured notes  effectively converting this fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
we repurchased and redeemed an aggregate of approximately million shares of our preferred stock for approximately million 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we acquired five operating properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  including assumed debt 
we disposed of four operating properties one owned through a joint venture for aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
during  we completed the following significant transactions we disposed of seven operating properties  one property under development and three parcels of land held for development 
we entered into a three year  million unsecured credit facility with jp morgan chase  as agent for a group of banks 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately million  including million shares repurchased from security capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies and estimates are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies and estimates relate to evaluating the impairment of long lived assets  our investment in hq global and other investments  assessing our probable liability under lease guarantees for hq global and evaluating the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable 
if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a rental property to be held and used or land held for development may be impaired  we perform a recoverability analysis based on estimated undiscounted cash flows to be generated from the property in the future 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from future cash flows  the property and related assets such as tenant improvements and lease commissions  are written down to estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
if we decide to sell rental properties or land holdings  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets 
if the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds  the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell and an impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties  recent sales data for comparable properties and  where applicable  contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers 
for and  we recognized impairment losses of million and million  respectively  on land held for development 
changes in estimated future cash flows due to changes in our plans or views of market and economic conditions could result in recognition of additional impairment losses which  under applicable accounting guidance  could be substantial 
if events or circumstances indicate that the fair value of an investment accounted for using the equity or cost method such as our investments in hq global and essention has declined below its carrying value and we consider the decline to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value and an impairment loss is recognized 
for example  our evaluation of impairment of our investment in hq global in was based on a number of factors 
these factors included analysis of the financial condition and operating results for hq global  the inability of hq global to remain in compliance with provisions of its debt agreements and its failure to reach an agreement with lenders on a restructuring of its debt prior to the expiration of a forbearance period in december  the losses of key board members and executives by hq global  particularly in the last half of  and the announcement by frontline capital group  hq global s controlling shareholder  in november that it had recognized an impairment in the value of intangible assets relating to hq global 
based on our evaluation  we determined in the fourth quarter of that our investment in hq global was impaired on an other than temporary basis and that our investment in hq global had no value 
accordingly  we wrote down the carrying value of our investment to zero and recognized the loss in continuing operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded that our investment in essention was partially impaired and wrote down the carrying value of our investment by million to million 
as a result of the bankruptcy of hq global  we were required to make estimates regarding our probable liability under guarantees of hq global s performance under four office leases 
after carefully evaluating the facts and circumstances of each property and developments in the bankruptcy proceedings  we accrued a loss of million in  our best estimate of the probable liability related to these guarantees 
circumstances may change in the future which could cause us to reevaluate our liability under these guarantees and adjust our estimate as appropriate 
our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivable  the payment history of the tenant or other debtor  the financial condition of the tenant and our assessment of its ability to meet its lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  etc 
our estimate of the required allowance  which is reviewed on a quarterly basis  is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on our tenants  particularly in our largest markets ie  the san francisco bay and washington  dc metro areas 
for example  due to economic conditions and analysis of our accounts and notes receivable  we increased our allowance for uncollectible accounts including related accrued straight line rents by approximately million in  million in and million in results of operations property operations revenue property operations revenue is summarized as follows for the year ended december  variance in millions vs

minimum base rent recoveries from tenants parking and other tenant charges property operations revenue is composed of minimum base rent from our office buildings  revenue from the recovery of operating expenses from our tenants and other revenue such as parking and termination fees 
occupancy rates in our buildings began to decline in most of our markets in late and continued to decline in this decline has negatively affected our operating revenue in both years

footage percent leased rentable sq 
footage percent leased washington  dc metro chicago atlanta dallas austin denver phoenix portland seattle salt lake city san francisco bay area orange county los angeles san diego total as a result of the ongoing weak economic climate  the real estate markets have been materially affected 
the sustained lack of job growth has reduced demand for office space and overall vacancy rates for office properties have increased in most of our markets 
in reviewing various outlooks for the economy  we believe that the vacancy rates will not improve in any material fashion until at least during  our markets weakened significantly and our operations in those markets were adversely impacted 
the occupancy in our portfolio of stabilized operating properties decreased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  market rental rates have declined in most markets from peak levels and we believe there will be additional declines in some markets in rental rates on space that was re leased in decreased an average of in comparison to rates that were in effect under expiring leases 
minimum base rent minimum base rent increased million in compared to and decreased million in as compared to the increase in minimum base rent in was due primarily to higher base rents from buildings we acquired in compared to the buildings we sold in  partially offset by higher vacancies 
the decrease in from was due primarily to the dispositions of properties  including the contribution of properties to a joint venture carr office park  llc in august and higher vacancies we expect minimum base rent to continue to decline in as a result of releasing space at lower rates than those that were in effect under expiring leases 
our lease rollover by square footage and rent at december  is as follows leased square footage rent and thereafter does not include million sq

of vacant space recoveries from tenants recoveries from tenants increased million in from the increase was due primarily to higher recoveries of real estate taxes and insurance expense which increased significantly in for the reasons discussed below 
recoveries from tenants decreased million in from due to dispositions of properties  including the properties contributed to carroffice park  llc  partially offset by development properties placed in service 
parking and other tenant charges parking and other tenant charges increased million in from this increase was due primarily to higher lease termination fees 
parking and other tenant charges decreased million in from due primarily to lower lease termination fees 
lease termination fees are paid by a tenant in exchange for our agreement to terminate the lease 
other tenant charges included million  million and million of termination fees in  and  respectively 
property expenses property expenses are summarized as follows for the year ended december  variance in millions vs

property operating expenses real estate taxes property operating expenses increased million in from as a result of higher insurance expense million and higher security costs million 
the increase in insurance expense was due primarily to general increases in insurance premiums and the cost of terrorism coverage 
these increases were partially offset by lower rent expense million resulting from the termination of a master lease on a property in the washington  dc metro market 
property operating expenses did not change in from real estate taxes increased million in from due primarily to higher taxes in the washington  dc metro market 
real estate taxes decreased million in from due to dispositions of properties  including properties contributed to carr office park  llc property operating margin property operating margin  defined as property operations revenue less property expenses  is summarized as follows for the year ended december  variance in millions vs

property operating margin property operating margin percent property operating margin decreased million in compared to property operating margin as a percentage of property operations revenue declined to in from in these decreases are due primarily to increased vacancies 
property operating margin decreased to million in from million in  however  property operating margin as a percentage of property operations revenue remained relatively unchanged at in compared to in the decrease in property operating margin in was due primarily to the dispositions of properties 
real estate service revenue real estate service revenue  which includes our third party property management services and our development services  decreased million in from the decrease occurred primarily because we earned one time incentive fees related to the development of properties in million and because leasing activity related to properties we manage for others decreased as a result of the economic and rental market conditions discussed above 
real estate service revenue increased million in from due to the one time development incentive fees discussed above 
interest expense interest expense increased million in from this increase was due primarily to higher debt levels to finance of our repurchase of preferred stock in the third quarter of and our repurchase of common shares in late which we financed with a million public debt offering in the first quarter of and two additional public debt offerings aggregating million in the fourth quarter of the effect of these increases was partially offset by a decrease in short term interest rates on our variable rate line of credit  our interest rate swap agreements and repayment of higher rate mortgages 
we have several interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million under which we pay a variable rate of interest 
during  these swaps resulted in lower interest expense of million 
interest expense decreased million in from due primarily to the repayment of debt and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses decreased million in from this decrease was due primarily to lower costs as a result of the savings derived from completing the implementation of our shared service center and completing portions of our internal process improvement efforts  reductions in incentive compensation and cost containment efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased million in from this increase was due to expanded development activity for third parties  principally joint ventures in which we have an interest  expanded property management operations and the cost associated with our internal process improvement efforts including the implementation of our shared service center and other initiatives 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million in from the increase was due primarily to the acquisition of properties and development properties placed in service and the write off of tenant improvement balances for defaulting tenants  partially offset by property dispositions

gain on sales of assets and other provisions  net  and discontinued property operations we dispose of assets sometimes using tax deferred exchanges that are inconsistent with our long term strategic or return objectives or where market conditions for sale are favorable 
the proceeds from the sales are redeployed into other properties or used to fund development operations or to support other corporate needs 
during  we disposed of four operating properties including one property in which we held an interest through an unconsolidated entity  recognizing a gain of million  including a gain of million relating to our share of gain on a sale of property in which we held an interest through an unconsolidated entity 
approximately million of the gain relates to our commons at las colinas property with which we have no continuing involvement after the sale 
accordingly  the gain and the results of operations of the property are classified as discontinued operations 
the balance of the gain relates to properties we continue to manage under management agreements 
accordingly  the gains on these sales and the operating results of the properties are not classified as discontinued operations due to our continuing involvement

other provisions for included an impairment loss of million for land held for development that we decided to sell 
for various reasons  we determined that we would not proceed with planned development of rental properties on certain of our land holdings and decided to market the land for sale 
as a result  we evaluated the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the land 
we determined that the carrying amounts would not be recovered from estimated net sale proceeds in certain cases and  in those cases  we recognized impairment losses

equity in earnings from unconsolidated entities decreased million in from this decrease was due primarily to decreased earnings of carr office park  llc as a result of higher interest expense 
in june  carr office park  llc obtained third party financing increasing its leverage and reducing our equity in earnings from the venture

consolidated cash flows consolidated cash flow information is summarized as follows for the year ended december  variance in millions vs 
vs 
cash provided by operating activities cash used by provided by investing activities cash used by financing activities operations generated million of net cash in compared to million in and million in the changes in cash flow from operating activities were primarily the result of factors discussed above in the analysis of operating results 
the level of net cash provided by operating activities is also affected by the timing of receipt of revenues and payment of expenses  including in income taxes relating to sales of properties and discontinued operations completed in our investing activities used net cash of million in and provided net cash of million in and million in the change in cash flows from investing activities in is due primarily to increased acquisition and development of operating properties million 
there were decreases in cash used for construction of properties million and land acquisitions million in due to lower levels of internal development activity 
distributions from unconsolidated entities also decreased in  as included a distribution from carr office park  llc million of proceeds from third party financing of its properties 
the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in from is due primarily to the fact that in  we sold our investment in hq global  generating million of cash 
proceeds from sales of properties were also higher in million due primarily to the carr office park  llc transaction 
the effect of these decreases on net cash provided by investing activities was partially offset by a reduction in development activities million  receipt of a distribution from carr office park  llc from proceeds of a third party financing of properties million and a release of restricted deposits million in connection with the acquisition of a property 
our financing activities used net cash of million in  million in and million in the decrease in net cash used by financing activities in is due primarily to lower dividend payments million and decreased stock repurchases million  partially offset by decreased net borrowings million 
during  we repurchased million of our common stock generally using our credit line to finance the purchases 
in  we had net borrowings on our credit line of million 
in  we decreased our debt significantly 
net debt repayments during totaled million including net repayment of credit facility borrowings of million and retirement of million of senior unsecured notes 
we also repurchased million of our common stock in liquidity and capital resources general as of december   we had approximately million in available cash and cash equivalents 
as a reit  we are required to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders on an annual basis 
in addition  we and our affiliates regularly require capital to invest in our existing portfolio of operating assets for capital projects 
these capital projects include such things as large scale renovations  routine capital improvements  deferred maintenance on properties we have recently acquired and leasing related matters  including tenant improvements  allowances and leasing commissions 
the amounts of the leasing related expenditures can vary significantly depending on negotiations with tenants and the willingness of tenants to pay higher base rents over the life of the leases 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from tenants under leases at our properties 
our operating cash flow therefore depends materially on the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
although our top tenants accounted for approximately of our annualized minimum base rents  we believe that the diversity of our tenant base no tenant accounted for more than of annualized minimum base rents as of december  helps insulate us from the negative impact of tenant defaults and bankruptcies 
however  general economic downturns  or economic downturns in one or more of our markets  could materially adversely impact the ability of our tenants to make lease payments and our ability to re lease space on favorable terms as leases expire 
in either of these cases  our cash flow and therefore our ability to meet our capital needs would be adversely affected 
as a result of the ongoing weak economic climate  the real estate markets have been materially affected 
the sustained lack of job growth has reduced demand for office space and overall vacancy rates for office properties have increased in most of our markets 
in reviewing various outlooks for the economy  we believe that the vacancy rates will not improve in any material fashion until at least during  our markets weakened significantly and our operations in those markets were adversely impacted 
the occupancy in our portfolio of stabilized operating properties decreased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  market rental rates have declined in most markets from peak levels and we believe there will be additional declines in some markets in rental rates on space that was re leased in decreased an average of in comparison to rates that were in effect under expiring leases 
in the future  if  as a result of general economic downturns  a credit rating downgrade or otherwise  our properties do not perform as expected  or we cannot raise the expected funds from the sale of properties and or if we are unable to obtain capital from other sources  we may not be able to make required principal and interest payments or make necessary routine capital improvements with respect to our existing portfolio of operating assets 
while we believe that we would continue to have sufficient funds to pay our operating expenses and debt service and our regular quarterly dividends  our ability to expand our development activity or to fund acquisition of new properties could be adversely affected 
in addition  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
an unsecured lender could also attempt to foreclose on some of our assets in order to receive payment 
in most cases  very little of the principal amount that we borrow is repaid prior to the maturity of the loan 
we generally expect to refinance that debt when it matures  although in some cases we may pay off the loan 
if principal amounts due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow may be insufficient to repay all maturing debt 
prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of a refinancing such as possible reluctance of lenders to make commercial real estate loans may result in higher interest rates and increased interest expense 
our ability to raise funds through sales of debt and equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  rental rates  occupancy levels  market perceptions about us  our debt rating and the current trading price of our stock 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the capital markets may not consistently be available on terms that are attractive 
capital structure we manage our capital structure to reflect a long term investment approach  generally seeking to match the stable return nature of our assets with a mix of equity and various debt instruments 
we expect that our capital structure will allow us to obtain additional capital from diverse sources that could include additional equity offerings of common stock and or preferred stock  public and private debt financings and possible asset dispositions 
our management believes  but there can be no assurance  that we will have access to the capital resources necessary to expand and develop our business  to fund our operating and administrative expenses  to continue to meet our debt service obligations  to pay dividends in accordance with reit requirements  to acquire additional properties and land and to pay for construction in progress 
our ability to raise funds through sales of debt and equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general economic conditions  general market conditions for reits  rental rates  occupancy levels  market perceptions about us  our debt rating and the current trading price of our stock 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the capital markets may not consistently be available on terms that are attractive 
debt financing we generally use fixed rate debt instruments in order to match the returns from our real estate assets 
we also utilize variable rate debt for short term financing purposes or to protect against the risk  at certain times  that fixed rates may overstate our long term costs of borrowing if assumed inflation or growth in the economy implicit in higher fixed interest rates do not materialize 
at times  our mix of variable and fixed rate debt may not suit our needs 
at those times  we use derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps and caps  forward interest rate options or interest rate options in order to assist us in managing our debt mix 
we either will hedge our variable rate debt to give it a fixed interest rate or hedge fixed rate debt to give it a variable interest rate 
we have three investment grade ratings 
as of december   fitch rating services and standard poors have each assigned their bbb rating to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and their bbb rating to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
moody s investor service has assigned its baa rating with a negative outlook to our prospective senior unsecured debt offerings and its baa rating to our prospective cumulative preferred stock offerings 
a downgrade in rating by any one of these rating agencies could result from  among other things  a change in our financial position or a downturn in general economic conditions 
any such downgrade could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or could increase the interest rates on our existing variable rate debt 
however  we have no debt instruments under which the principal maturity would be accelerated upon a downward change in our debt rating 
our total debt at december  is summarized as follows in thousands fixed rate mortgages unsecured credit facility senior unsecured notes unamortized discount and fair value adjustment  net our fixed rate mortgage debt bore an effective weighted average interest rate of at december  and had a weighted average maturity of years 
million of our total debt at december  bore a libor based variable interest rate and million was subject to variable interest rates through interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate on borrowings on our unsecured credit facility at december  was 
our primary external source of liquidity is our credit facility 
we have a three year  million unsecured credit facility expiring in june with jp morgan chase  as agent for a group of banks 
we can extend the life of the facility an additional year at our option 
the facility carries an interest rate of basis points over day libor  or as of december  as of december   million was drawn on the credit facility  million in letters of credit were outstanding and we had million available for borrowing 
our unsecured credit facility contains financial and other covenants with which we must comply 
some of these covenants include a minimum ratio of annual ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest expense  a minimum ratio of annual ebitda to fixed charges  a maximum ratio of aggregate unsecured debt to unencumbered assets  a maximum ratio of total debt to tangible fair market value of our assets  and restrictions on our ability to make dividend distributions in excess of of funds from operations 
availability under the unsecured credit facility is also limited to a specified percentage of the fair value of our unmortgaged properties 
we are currently in compliance with all the financial covenants of our credit facility 
failure to comply with these or any of the other covenants under our unsecured credit facility or other debt instruments could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments 
this could cause our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and would therefore have a material adverse effect on our business  operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we have senior unsecured notes outstanding at december  as follows in thousands note principal unamortized discount fair value adjustment total notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in notes due in of our senior unsecured notes  million was issued in in january  we issued million of senior unsecured notes

these include limits on our total indebtedness on a consolidated basis  limits on our secured indebtedness on a consolidated basis  limits on our required debt service payments  and compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility

as of december   taking into account the effect of the interest rate swaps  the effective interest rate on the notes was reduced to as part of the assumption of million of debt associated with the purchase of two operating properties in august  we also purchased interest rate caps with a notional amount of million and a cap on libor 
the fair value of the interest rate caps was not material at december  stock repurchases on september   we redeemed million shares of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock at a redemption price of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends for the period from september  through and including the redemption date  without interest 
additionally  during  we repurchased million shares of our preferred stock for approximately million 
our unsecured credit facility contained a financial covenant requiring us to maintain at least billion of tangible net worth as defined by the facility 
after giving effect to the proposed redemption of our series b preferred stock  we would have been in violation of that covenant 
therefore  on july  we entered into an amendment to the facility  reducing the minimum tangible net worth requirement to million 
our board of directors has authorized us to spend up to million to repurchase our common stock  preferred stock and debt securities  excluding the million shares repurchased from security capital in november and our preferred stock redemption of million shares in september  which were separately approved 
since the start of this program in mid through december   we have acquired approximately million of our common shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million including approximately million shares for million in we continue to monitor market conditions and other alternative investments in order to evaluate whether repurchase of our securities is appropriate 
we pay dividends quarterly 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of the board of directors  the ability to pay dividends under maryland law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to stockholders 
in addition  under our line of credit  we generally are restricted from paying dividends that would exceed of our funds from operations during any four quarter period 
capital commitments we will require capital for development projects currently underway and in the future 
as of december   we had approximately  rentable square feet of office space in two wholly owned development projects in progress 
our total expected investment on these projects is million 
through december   we had invested million or of the total expected investment for these projects 
we also have a residential project under development 
we undertook this wholly owned project in conjunction with an office development project in a joint venture 
our total investment in the residential project is expected to be million 
as of december   we had invested million in this project with the remainder expected to be incurred during as of december   we also had  rentable square feet of office space under construction in two joint venture projects in which we own minority interests 
these projects are expected to cost million  of which our total investment is expected to be approximately million 
through december   approximately million or of total project costs had been expended on these projects 
we have financed our investment in both our wholly owned and our joint venture projects under construction at december  primarily from borrowings under our credit facility 
we expect that our credit facility and project specific financing of selected assets will provide the additional funds required to complete existing development projects and to finance the costs of additional projects we may undertake 
as a result of market conditions  we believe we will be limiting our development activities in the near future and expect to concentrate our growth efforts on the acquisition of properties 
below is a summary of certain obligations that will require significant capital payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases land operating leases building estimated development commitments unconsolidated investments and joint ventures we have minority investments in two non real estate operating companies  agilquest and essention  which we account for using the cost method 
these are startup entities in which we invested million and million  respectively 
to date  neither company has had any substantial earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment of  on our investment in essention because we believe the value of our investment was partially impaired 
in the future  additional impairment charges related to our investments may be required 
we have investments in real estate joint ventures in which we hold interests 
these investments are accounted for using the equity or cost method  as appropriate  and therefore the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
most of these joint ventures own and operate office buildings financed by non recourse debt obligations that are secured only by the real estate and other assets of the joint ventures 
we have no obligation to repay this debt and the lenders have no recourse to our other assets 
as of december   we guaranteed million of debt related to a joint venture and have provided completion guarantees related to three joint venture projects for which total costs are anticipated to be million  of which million had been expended to date 
we have not funded any amounts under these guarantees and do not expect any funding will be required in the future 
our investments in these joint ventures are subject to risks not inherent in our majority owned properties  including absence of exclusive control over the development  financing  leasing  management and other aspects of the project  possibility that our co venturer or partner might become bankrupt  have interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours  take action contrary to our instructions  requests or interests including those related to our qualification as a reit for tax purposes  or otherwise impede our objectives  and possibility that we  together with our partners  may be required to fund losses of the investee 
in addition to making investments in these ventures  we provide construction management  leasing and property management  development and architectural and other services to them

it is a payment guaranty to the lender on behalf of the joint venture 
if the joint venture defaults on the loan  we may be required to perform under the guarantee 
we have a reimbursement guarantee from the other joint venture partner to repay us their proportionate share of any monies we pay under the guarantee 
loan guarantee relates to a third party project for which we are the developer 
it is a payment guarantee to the lender 
if the third party defaults on the loan  we may be required to perform under the guarantee 
we have a security interest in the third party s interest in the underlying property 
in the event of a default  we can exercise our rights under the security agreement to take title to the property and sell the property to mitigate our exposure under the guarantee 
we have guaranteed leases related to hq global workplaces  inc for further discussion  see hq global workplaces  inc below 
see item legal proceedings for further discussion 
in the normal course of business  we guarantee our performance of services or indemnify third parties against our negligence 
insurance although we believe our properties are adequately covered by insurance  we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain full coverage at a reasonable cost in the future 
the costs associated with our june  property and casualty insurance renewals were higher than anticipated 
although we have an excellent claims history and safety record  all lines of coverage were affected by higher premiums  in part because insurance companies have experienced a loss of income on their investments  underwriting results have been poor and also as a result of the events of september  our insurance renewal on june  increased premiums from the prior year approximately 
the property insurance deductible increased from  to  per claim 
since reinsurance treaties renew twice each year january and july  our property and casualty insurance renewal date has been changed from june to may to enable underwriters to concentrate on the insurance proposals well ahead of treaty renewal 
in december  three major corporate insurance policies were renewed for another annual term 
the policies were the directors and officers liability  employment practices liability and the professional errors and omissions liability 
as had been expected  the insurance markets were not favorable to the buyer due mainly to insurance industry conditions 
the increases in premiums were for directors and officers liability  for employment practices liability and for professional errors and omissions liability 
the deductible for the directors and officers liability policy changed from  for each claim to  for securities claims and  for all other claims 
the deductible for the employment practices liability increased from  per claim to  per claim 
in  all risk property insurers began attaching terrorism exclusions to insurance policies 
as a result of the terrorism risk insurance act of  terrorism insurance must now be priced separately within the property insurance coverage 
unlike earthquake exposure  insurers do not yet have a means of modeling the terrorism risk 
during  we completed an in depth evaluation of our terrorism exposure as well as our lender requirements 
upon our renewal date for insurance of june   we purchased terrorism coverage with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate  with a deductible of million per claim  at a cost of approximately million per year 
the policy covers only physical damage and our amount of coverage may not be enough for all damages that could result from a terrorist attack 
coverage does not include losses due to biological  chemical or radioactive contamination 
the lack of coverage for such contamination could have a material adverse effect on our financial results if a building we own becomes uninhabitable as a result of biological  chemical  radioactive or other contamination 
we do not anticipate purchasing any additional terrorism coverage before may   our insurance renewal date 
hq global workplaces  inc in  we began making investments in hq global workplaces  inc hq global  a provider of executive office suites 
on june   we  along with hq global  vantas incorporated vantas and frontline capital group frontline  consummated several transactions including i the merger of vantas with and into hq global  ii the acquisition by frontline of shares of hq global common stock from us and other stockholders of hq global  and iii the acquisition by vantas of our debt and equity interests in omnioffices uk limited and omnioffices lux holding company sa we received million in cash in connection with these transactions 
in addition  million of debt which we had guaranteed was repaid with a portion of the cash proceeds 
following the transaction  we owned approximately of the equity of hq global on a diluted basis and our investment had a carrying value of million 
frontline  the majority stockholder of hq global  announced in october that hq global was in default with respect to certain covenant and payment obligations under its senior and mezzanine term indebtedness  was in a forbearance period with hq global lenders and was actively negotiating with those lenders 
in november  frontline disclosed that it had recognized an impairment in the value of intangible assets relating to hq global due to hq global s trend of operating losses and its inability to remain in compliance with the terms of its debt arrangements 
based on these factors  our analysis of the financial condition and operating results of hq global which deteriorated significantly during as the economic slowdown reduced the demand for temporary office space  particularly from technology related tenants and the losses of key board members and executives by hq global  particularly in the last half of  we determined in the fourth quarter of  that our investment in hq global was impaired 
we recorded a million impairment charge  reducing the carrying value of our remaining investment in hq global to zero 
on march   hq global filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws 
during and  to assist hq global as it grew its business  we provided guarantees of hq global s performance under four office leases 
to our knowledge  all monthly rental payments were made by hq global under two of these leases through january  and rental payments under the other two leases were made through february in connection with the june merger transaction  frontline agreed to indemnify us against any losses incurred with respect to guarantees of the four office leases 
however  on june   frontline also filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy laws  and therefore it is unlikely that we will recover any resulting losses from frontline under this indemnity 
in the course of its bankruptcy proceedings  hq global has filed motions to reject two of these four leases 
one lease is for space in san jose  california 
this lease is for approximately  square feet of space at two adjacent buildings and runs through october total aggregate remaining lease payments under this lease as of february  were approximately million approximately million of which was payable in  however  our liability under this guarantee was limited to approximately million 
we reached an agreement with the landlord of this lease pursuant to which we paid million in full satisfaction of the guarantee in january we recognized this expense in the second lease that was rejected by hq global is a sublease for space in downtown manhattan 
this lease is for approximately  square feet of space and runs through march  with total aggregate remaining lease payments as of february  of approximately million approximately million of which was payable in 
in june  we received a demand for payment of the full amount of the guarantee 
however  we believe that we have defenses to payment under this guarantee available to us and joined with hq global in filing suit on july  in hq global s bankruptcy proceedings asking the bankruptcy court to declare that the lease was terminated by the landlord of the sublease not later than february  on july   the landlord under the sublease filed suit in federal court in new york seeking payment from us under this guarantee 
in light of our defenses and these proceedings  we have not accrued any expense relating to this guarantee  however  there can be no assurance as to the outcome of the pending litigation or that we will not incur expense or be required to make cash payments relating to this guarantee up to the full amount of the guarantee 
as of december   we had not made any payments under this guarantee 
hq global has not filed a motion seeking to reject the remaining two leases that we have guaranteed  although it could do so in the future 
even if the leases are not rejected  we may ultimately be liable to the lessors for payments due under the leases 
in one case  the lease is for approximately  square feet of space in midtown manhattan  and our liability is currently capped at approximately million  which liability reduces over the life of the lease until its expiration in september as of december   we have not accrued any expense related to or made any payments under this guarantee 
the remaining lease is for space in san mateo  california 
this lease is for approximately  square feet of space and runs through january  with total aggregate remaining lease payments as of march  of approximately million approximately million of which was payable in 
we initially recognized an expense of million under this guarantee in the first quarter of based on a tentative agreement with hq global under which hq global would not reject this lease obligation and we would fund hq global s operating losses at this location for a limited period of time 
due to deteriorating conditions in the local commercial real estate market  hq global subsequently determined that the tentative agreement was not in its best interest 
hq global indicated to us that it intended to reject this lease unless its rent was reduced to current market rates 
as an interim measure  we entered into an agreement with hq global as of june  to fund operating losses at this location up to an aggregate amount of  in exchange for hq global forbearing from rejecting this lease until september   or if it obtained from the bankruptcy court an extension of time within which to reject leases  november  because the bankruptcy court has since twice extended the time period within which hq global may reject this lease to may   we have twice extended the existing forbearance agreement in exchange for funding operating losses up to an additional aggregate amount of  as a result of our efforts to mitigate our exposure under this guarantee  we entered into agreements with hq global in january under which hq global assigned its interest as a tenant in this lease to us and we in turn subleased the space back to hq global at current market rates 
these agreements remain subject to approval by both the bankruptcy court and the landlord under the lease 
in addition  these agreements will not be enforceable if hq global fails to successfully reorganize and emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the necessary approvals will be granted  that material changes to the agreements will not be required to gain approvals  or that hq global will successfully reorganize and emerge from the bankruptcy proceedings 
we increased our provision for loss under this guarantee to million in the second quarter of and this continues to represent the amount we have determined to be our likely exposure under this guarantee as of december  however  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to further increase our provision or make cash payments related to this guarantee in future periods up to  in the aggregate  the full amount of the guarantee 
as of december   we had not made any payments under this guarantee 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others 
for  the interpretation requires certain disclosures which we have included in the footnotes to the financial statements

we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
beginning january   we will adopt the prospective transition method for all new stock compensation awards 
we do not anticipate that adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no

this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we do not anticipate that adoption of interpretation no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
funds from operations we believe that funds from operations is helpful to investors as a measure of the operating performance of an equity reit 
based on our experience  funds from operations  along with information about cash flows from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  provides investors with an indication of our ability to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures and to fund other cash needs 
funds from operations is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as follows net income loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  less gains or plus losses from sales of depreciable operating properties and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
our funds from operations may not be comparable to funds from operations reported by other reits 
these other reits may not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or may interpret the current nareit definition differently than us
