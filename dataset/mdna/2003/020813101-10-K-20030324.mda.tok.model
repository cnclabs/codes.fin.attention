additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
in the company s us human pharmaceutical business  and to a lesser extent in human pharmaceuticals international  sales to certain customers require that the company remit discounts to either customers or governmental authorities in the form of rebates  chargebacks  or other managed care reserves 
additionally  sales are generally made with a limited right of return under certain conditions 
the company estimates these rebates  chargebacks  managed care reserves and estimated returns at the time of sale based on the terms of agreements with customers and historical experience and recognizes revenue net of these estimated costs 
the company continually monitors the adequacy of procedures used to estimate these reductions by comparison of estimated reductions to actual reductions 
goodwill and intangible assets the company has completed several acquisitions since  which have generated significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets and related amortization 
the values assigned to goodwill and intangibles  as well as their related useful lives  are subject to judgment and estimation by the company 
in addition  in  upon adoption of sfas  the company ceased amortization of goodwill and reviewed goodwill upon transition and at year end for impairment 
goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions are determined based on purchase price allocations 
these allocations  including an assessment of estimated useful lives  have generally been performed by qualified independent appraisers using reasonable valuation methodologies 
valuation of intangible assets is generally based on the estimated cash flows related to those assets  while the value assigned to goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of all identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
useful lives are determined based on the expected future period of benefit of the asset  the assessment of which considers various characteristics of the asset  including historical cash flows 
asset impairments long lived assets  including plant and equipment  and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that a dimunition in value may have occurred  based on a comparison of undiscounted future cash flows to the carrying amount of the goodwill or intangible asset 
if the carrying amount exceeds undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded based on the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment in accordance with sfas the assessment of potential impairment for a particular asset or set of assets requires certain judgments and estimates by the company  including the determination of an event indicating impairment  the future cash flows to be generated by the asset  including the estimated life of the asset and likelihood of alternative courses of action  the risk associated with those cash flows  and the company s cost of capital or discount rate to be utilized 
research and development r d  including in process r d ipr d the company s products are subject to regulation by governmental authorities  principally the food and drug administration fda in the united states and equivalent authorities in international markets 
research and development expenses are charged to the consolidated statement of operations when incurred  as the company considers that regulatory and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products preclude it from capitalizing development costs 
with respect to completed acquisitions  acquired products or projects which have achieved technical feasibility  signified by fda or comparable regulatory body approval  are capitalized as intangible assets because it is probable that the costs will give rise to future economic benefits 
estimates of the values of these intangible assets are subject to the estimation process described in goodwill and intangible assets above 
acquired products or projects which have not achieved technical feasibility ie  regulatory approval are charged to the statement of operations on the date of acquisition 
in connection with its acquisitions  the company generally utilizes independent appraisers in the determination of ipr d charges 
the amount of this charge is determined based on a variety of factors including the estimated future cash flows of the product or project  the likelihood of future benefit from the product or project  and the level of risk associated with future research and development activities related to the product or project 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis for most inventories  with certain us human pharmaceutical inventory values on a last in  first out basis 
the determination of market value to compare to cost involves assessment of numerous factors  including costs to dispose of inventory and estimated selling prices 
reserves are recorded for inventory determined to be damaged  obsolete  or otherwise unsaleable 
the company also purchases raw materials  and manufactures finished goods  for certain products prior to the product receiving regulatory approval or during a period when the product is subject to litigation 
the company reviews these inventories on a case by case basis  and records a write down of the inventory if it becomes probable that regulatory approval will not be obtained  litigation will be resolved unfavorably  or the inventory s cost will not be recoverable based on other factors 
employee benefit plans the company provides a range of benefits to employees and retired employees  including pension  post retirements  post employment and health care benefits 
the company records annual amounts relating to these plans based on the calculations  which include various actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  assumed rates of return  compensation increases  turnover rates  and health care cost and trend rates 
the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so 
the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
the company believes that the assumptions utilized for recording its obligations under its plans are reasonable based on input from actuaries 
litigation and contingencies the company is subject to litigation in the ordinary course of business  and also to certain other contingencies see item of this form k and note to the financial statements 
the company records legal fees and other expenses related to litigation and contingencies as incurred 
additionally  the company assesses  in consultation with its counsel  the need to record liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
reserves are recorded when the company  in consultation with counsel  determines that a loss related to a matter is both probable and reasonably estimable 
income taxes the company applies an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s assessment that it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated in the relevant tax jurisdiction to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event the company determines that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
the company s valuation allowance principally relates to net operating loss carryforwards in certain state and foreign jurisdictions with little or no history of generating taxable income
