item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of business analytics software that helps our customers to automate the integration  analysis and delivery of critical corporate information 
using our products  managers and executives gain valuable business insight they can use to help improve operational performance and enhance competitive advantage 
we sell our products through direct sales forces in the united states as well as belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom  and also through distributors throughout asia pacific  australia  europe  japan and latin america 
as a percent of our total consolidated revenue  international revenues from both our direct sales force and foreign indirect strategic partners were in  in and in substantially all of our international sales have been in europe 
sales outside of north america and europe to date have been or less of total consolidated revenues during the last three years  although we anticipate further expansion outside of these two regions in the future 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets 
table of contents and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our audit committee 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item  which contains additional information regarding our accounting policies and other disclosures required by gaap 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition we generate revenues from sales of software licenses and services  which consist of maintenance  consulting and training 
our license revenues are derived from our business analytic software  which consists of data integration products and  to a lesser extent  data warehouse modules  business intelligence platform and analytic application suites 
we receive software license revenues from licensing our products directly to end users and indirectly through resellers  distributors and oems 
we receive service revenues from maintenance contracts  consulting services and training that we perform for customers that license our products either directly from us or indirectly through resellers  distributors and oems 
we recognize revenue in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop software revenue recognition  as amended and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
we recognize license revenues when a noncancelable license agreement has been signed  the product has been shipped  the fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists to allocate the fee to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately 
in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price is established by our authorized management 
if an acceptance period is required  we recognize revenue upon customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
credit worthiness and collectibility for end users are first assessed on a country level and then  for those customers in countries deemed to have sufficient timely payment history  customers are assessed based on payment history and credit profile 
for the data integration products  data warehouse modules  and business intelligence platform sold directly to end users  we recognize revenue upon shipment when collectibility is probable 
when a customer is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
for our analytic application suites  we recognize both the license and maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance period  generally one year 
support for the analytic application suites for the first year is never sold separately and in consideration of the complexities of the implementation the customer is entitled to receive support services that are different than the standard annual support services of our other products 
our standard agreements do not contain product return rights 
we also enter into reseller and distributor arrangements that typically provide for sublicense or end user license fees based on a percentage of list prices 
revenue arrangements with resellers and distributors require evidence of sell through  that is  persuasive evidence that the products have been sold to an identified end user 
for data integration products  data warehouse modules and business intelligence platform sold indirectly through our resellers and distributors  we recognize revenue upon shipment and receipt of evidence of sell through if the reseller or distributor has been deemed credit worthy 
credit worthiness and collectibility for resellers and distributors are first assessed on a country level and then  for resellers and distributors in countries deemed to have sufficient timely payment history  resellers and distributors are assessed based on established credit history consisting of sales of at least one million dollars and with timely payment history  generally for the last twelve months 
when resellers and distributors are not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
we also enter into oem arrangements that provide for license fees based on inclusion of our products in the oems products 
these arrangements provide for fixed  irrevocable royalty payments 
credit worthiness 
table of contents and collectibility for oems are first assessed on a country level and then  for those oems in countries deemed to have sufficient timely payment history  oems are assessed based on established credit history consisting of sales of at least one million dollars and with timely payment history  generally for the last twelve months 
for credit worthy oems  royalty payments are recognized when due 
when oems are not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
we recognize maintenance revenues  which consist of fees for ongoing support and product updates  ratably over the term of the contract  typically one year 
consulting revenues are primarily related to implementation services and product enhancements performed on a time and materials basis or  on a very infrequent basis  a fixed fee arrangement under separate service arrangements related to the installation and implementation of our software products 
training revenues are generated from classes offered at our headquarters  sales offices and customer locations 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
when a contract includes both license and service elements  the license fee is recognized on delivery of the software or cash collections  provided services do not include significant customization or modification of the base product  and are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software and the payment terms for licenses are not dependent on additional acceptance criteria 
deferred revenue includes deferred license  maintenance  consulting and training revenue 
deferred revenue amounts do not include items that are both deferred and unbilled 
our practice is to net unpaid deferred items against the related receivables balances from those oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers for which we defer revenue until payment is received 
allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for sales returns on revenue in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates require management judgment and are based on historical sales returns and other known factors 
if these estimates do not adequately reflect future sales returns  revenue could be overstated 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific allowance against amounts due to us 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
for example  we recorded an additional bad debt expense in related to customers that filed for bankruptcy 
impairment of goodwill we assessed goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  which requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level reporting unit at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas consistent with our determination that we have only one reporting segment  we have determined that there is only one reporting unit  specifically the license  implementation and support of our software applications 
goodwill was tested for impairment on the adoption of sfas on january  and in the annual impairment test on october  using the two step process required by sfas first  we reviewed the carrying amount of the reporting unit compared to the fair value of the reporting unit based on quoted market prices of our common stock and the discounted cash flows based on analyses prepared by management and with the assistance of third party analysts 
management s cash flow forecasts were based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying assumptions 
an excess carrying value compared to fair value would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
second  if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  then we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill  as defined by sfas  to its carrying amount to determine the impairment loss  if any 

table of contents based on these estimates  we determined that as of october  there were no indications of impairment of goodwill 
however  future changes in market capitalization or estimates used in discounted cash flows analyses could result in significantly different fair value of the reporting unit  which may result in impairment of goodwill 
restructuring charges during and  we recorded significant charges in connection with our excess facilities 
the accrued restructuring charges represent gross lease obligations and estimated commissions and other costs principally leasehold improvements and asset write offs  offset by estimated gross sublease income expected to be received over the remaining lease terms 
these liabilities include management s estimates pertaining to sublease activities 
we will continue to evaluate the commercial real estate market conditions quarterly to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable based on current and expected commercial real estate market conditions 
if we determine that there is further deterioration in the estimated sublease rates or in the expected time to sublease our vacant space  we may incur additional restructuring charges in the future and our cash position could be adversely affected 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item deferred taxes we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is likely to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  if it were determined that we would be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which such determination was made 
likewise  if we determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination was made 

table of contents years ended december   and the following table presents certain financial data as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenues license service total revenues cost of revenues license service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of stock based compensation amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets purchased in process research and development restructuring charges total operating expenses loss from operations interest income and other  net interest expense loss before income taxes income tax provision net loss cost of license revenues  as a percentage of license revenues cost of service revenues  as a percentage of service revenues revenues our total revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to our license revenues decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing a decrease of in from and an increase of in from the decrease in from was due to a decrease in the number of licenses sold  which we believe was caused by weak global economic conditions  principally reflecting reduced or delayed information technology it spending by our customers 
this decrease was partially offset by a slight increase in the average transaction size 
the increase in from was due primarily to an increase in the number of licenses sold and the average transaction size  primarily reflecting increased acceptance of our data integration products and  to a lesser extent  our analytic application suites as well as expansion of our direct sales organization and reseller channels 
service revenues increased to million in from million in and million in 
table of contents  representing growth of in from and in from these increases were primarily due to an increase in maintenance revenues associated with strong renewal maintenance 
for  we expect maintenance revenue to remain strong based on our growing installed customer base and we expect contributions from consulting and training services to remain relatively consistent with our international revenues were million in  million in and million in  representing a decrease of in from and an increase of in from the decrease in from was due primarily to the weak worldwide macroeconomic environment  particularly in europe 
the increase in from was due primarily to our expansion throughout europe  asia pacific and japan with increased sales being generated by direct sales  increased volume through existing distributors and new distributors added during the year 
international revenues as a percentage of total revenues were  and for  and  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item for additional information about revenues in geographic areas 
as a result of these license revenue trends and continued uncertainty in it spending by our customers and prospects  our ability to meet our forecasted sales for will be highly dependent on our success in converting our sales pipeline into license revenues from orders received and shipped within the quarter 
in particular  the general economic slowdown has caused customer purchases to be reduced in amount  deferred or cancelled  and therefore has reduced the overall license pipeline conversion rates in and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the sales pipeline into license revenue in the future 
see risk factors if we are unable to accurately forecast revenues  it may harm our business or results of operations 
and risk factors we expect seasonal trends to cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate 
in addition  our future prospects will be directly affected by our ability to successfully license our data integration products and our analytic application suites 
we recently released our new business intelligence platform and new versions of our analytic application suites and data integration products  and we released our data warehouse modules in the fourth quarter of the degree of market acceptance for these products is currently uncertain 
if we are not able to successfully license our products  our net revenues and operating results would be adversely affected 
see risk factors because we sell a limited number of products  if these products do not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues will be adversely affected and risk factors changes in our product packaging may impact market acceptance of our products or adversely affect our results of operations 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
in particular  our license revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
in addition  we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter 
see risk factors the expected fluctuation of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines 
cost of revenues cost of license revenues our cost of license revenues consists primarily of software royalties  product packaging  documentation  and production costs 
cost of license revenues was million in  million in and million in and was approximately of license revenues in  in and in the increase in absolute dollar amount in from and was due primarily to increases in our percentage mix of royalty bearing products 
for  we expect the cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to remain relatively consistent with the level 
cost of service revenues our cost of service revenues is a combination of costs of maintenance  consulting and training revenues 
our cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of costs associated with software upgrades  telephone and on line support services and on site visits 
cost of consulting revenues consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing consulting services at customers facilities 
cost of training revenues consists primarily of the costs of providing training classes and materials at our headquarters  sales and training offices 
table of contents and customer locations 
because we believe that providing a high level of support to customers is a strategic advantage  we have invested significantly in personnel and infrastructure 
cost of service revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of service revenues  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollar amount in from was primarily due to a decrease in personnel costs 
the increase in absolute dollar amount in from reflected the hiring of additional service personnel in response to an increased customer base and increased demand for consulting services 
for  we expect our cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues to be relatively consistent with the level 
operating expenses research and development our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses associated with the development of new products  the enhancement and localization of existing products  quality assurance and development of documentation for our products 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in and increased from million in and was approximately of total revenues in  in and in the decrease in absolute dollar amount in from was due primarily to a slight decrease in research and development personnel costs 
the increase in absolute dollar amount in from was due primarily to an increase in personnel costs for development of future products and enhancement of existing products 
to date  all software and development costs have been expensed in the period incurred because costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant 
for  we expect research and development expense as a percentage of total revenues will remain at or slightly below the level 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including commissions  as well as costs of public relations  seminars  marketing programs  lead generation  travel and trade shows 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in and increased from million in and was approximately of total revenues in  in and in the decrease in absolute dollar amount from to was due primarily to decreased sales and marketing personnel costs and decreased commission expense 
the increase in absolute dollar amount in from reflects the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel in connection with building our direct  reseller  distributor and oem channels  higher sales commissions associated with increased sales volume  and increased spending associated with trade shows  user conference and other marketing programs 
for  we expect sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues will remain at or slightly below the level 
general and administrative our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  human resources  legal and general management  as well as professional services expense associated with recruiting  legal and accounting 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in  representing of our total revenues in and and of our total revenues in the increase in expenses in each period in absolute dollar amounts was primarily due to increased staffing in finance  human resources  legal  information technology and administration to manage and support our growth and increased infrastructure as well as increased costs paid to outside professional service providers and increased facilities costs 
we expect that for  our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues will remain at or slightly below our level for bad debt expense charged to operations was million in  million in and million in  representing less than of total revenues in each of these years 
in  million of the charges to bad debt expense was associated with customers that filed for bankruptcy during the year 

table of contents amortization of stock based compensation amortization of stock based compensation amounted to million in  million in and million in we expect to record amortization of stock based compensation of approximately  in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets we have acquired 
other intangible assets include core technology and patents 
we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of syn t sys and informatica partners in and delphi solutions ag  zimba and qrb developers in as well as the strategic alliance with pricewaterhousecoopers pwc in amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our business combinations and strategic alliance has been amortized on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives ranging from two years to three years 
as required by sfas  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of january  we will continue to amortize other intangible assets on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease is due to the adoption of sfas effective january  for the intangible assets that we will continue to amortize  we expect amortization expense to be approximately million for it is likely that we will continue to expand our business both through acquisitions and internal development 
any additional acquisitions could result in additional merger and acquisition related expenses and any impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets could result in incremental expense 
purchased in process research and development in connection with our strategic alliance with pwc and the acquisitions of zimba and qrb developers  we recorded charges to operations of million  million and million  respectively  for purchased in process research and development in the in process technologies had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the value of the purchased in process research and development in each transaction was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimates of future revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses related to the products and technologies acquired and determined by an independent third party 
restructuring charges in september  we announced a restructuring plan and recorded restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting of million related to estimated facility lease losses and million in leasehold improvement and asset write offs related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
in september  we recorded additional restructuring charges of approximately million  consisting of million related to estimated facility lease losses and million in leasehold improvement and asset write offs related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities as a result of continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market in these areas 
these charges represent adjustments to the original charges recorded in september  including the time period that the buildings are expected to be vacant  expected sublease rates and expected sublease terms 
we estimated the additional costs for restructuring charges using current market information and trend analysis provided by an independent commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 
net cash payments for related to the consolidation of excess facilities amounted to million 
actual future cash requirements may differ from the restructuring liability balances as of december  if there are changes to the time period that facilities are vacant or the actual sublease income is different from current estimates 
as of december   million of lease termination costs  net of anticipated sublease income related to facilities to be subleased  remains accrued and is expected to be paid by if we 
table of contents are unable to sublease any of the available vacant facilities during the remaining lease terms from the fourth quarter of through  restructuring charges could increase by approximately million 
if we do not occupy certain available vacant facilities during the remaining lease terms from through  restructuring charges could increase by approximately an additional million 
interest income and other  net  interest expense interest income and other  net represents primarily interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash 
interest income and other  net was million in  million in and million in the decrease in from was primarily due to lower interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash  partially offset by foreign currency gains and losses on property and equipment disposals 
the increase in from was primarily due to an increased average cash balance as a result of the completion of our follow on public offering of our common stock with net proceeds of million in october interest expense was million in and and million in we currently do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities and  therefore  are susceptible to fluctuations in foreign exchange gains or losses in our results of operations in future reporting periods 
income tax provision we recorded an income tax provision of million in  million in and million in primarily due to income taxes currently payable on income generated in non us jurisdictions 
the expected tax benefit derived by applying the federal statutory rate to our operating loss in fiscal differed from the income tax provision recorded primarily due to an increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and non deductible amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the expected tax benefit derived by applying the federal statutory rate to our operating losses in fiscal and differed from the income tax provision recorded primarily due to non deductible merger related expenses  alternative minimum tax expense and an increase in our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
as of december  and  we had deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively  which have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
approximately million of the valuation allowance for deferred taxes was attributable to stock option deductions  the benefit of which will be credited to equity when realized 
sfas provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and the reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  and foreign tax credits of approximately million 
our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various times beginning in  if not utilized 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity and requires such costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred 
previous guidance in eitf required that a liability for an exit cost be recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated by a company after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary 
table of contents change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  as permitted under sfas  we adopted only the disclosure provisions of that accounting standard in the consolidated financial statements in item the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of fin as of december  in addition  we are required to adopt the initial recognition and measurement of the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe fin will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie  formerly referred to as special purpose entities 
fin applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie 
fin provides guidance for determining when an entity  the primary beneficiary  should consolidate another entity  a vie  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie and do not have any such plans and therefore the adoption will not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through cash flows from operations and public offerings of our common stock 
in the past  we also funded our operations through private sales of preferred equity securities and capital equipment leases 
as of december   we had million in available cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and million of restricted cash under the terms of our pacific shores property leases 
our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of million for the operating cash inflows were primarily due to increases in deferred revenue and accrued liabilities 
the uses of cash were primarily due to the net loss offset by non cash charges for depreciation and amortization  restructuring charges  sales and return allowances and amortization of other intangible assets and increases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease in accrued compensation and related expenses 
our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of million for and million for the sources of cash in resulted principally from increases in accrued liabilities  accrued compensation and related expenses  accrued restructuring charges and deferred revenue

financing activities provided cash of million in  consisting principally of proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  primarily from the net proceeds of our secondary offering of million as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock  partially offset by final payments on notes payable to stockholders associated with the acquisition of influence in december we lease certain office facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases 
during and  we recorded restructuring charges related to the consolidation of excess leased facilities in the san francisco bay area and texas 
operating lease payments in the table below include approximately million  net of anticipated sublease income  for operating lease commitments for those facilities that are included in restructuring charges 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item our future minimum lease payments as of december  under noncancelable operating leases with original terms in excess of one year are summarized as follows operating leases in thousands years ending december thereafter total minimum lease payments during  we signed sublease agreements for leased office space in palo alto  california and carrollton  texas 
under the sublease agreements  we will receive sublease income of million  million  million and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
in february  we entered into two lease agreements for new corporate headquarters in redwood city  california 
we occupied the new corporate headquarters in august the lease expires in july we paid for tenant improvements  primarily related to the exercise of build to suit options under the facility lease 
table of contents agreement 
the total cost of leasehold improvements for this facility through its completion in june was approximately million 
total expenditures for furniture  fixtures and equipment for this facility were approximately million 
as part of these agreements  we have purchased certificates of deposit totaling million as a security deposit for lease payments until certain financial covenants are met 
these certificates of deposit are classified as long term restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred revenue includes deferred license  maintenance  consulting and training revenue 
deferred license revenue amounts do not include items which are both deferred and unbilled 
our practice is to net unpaid deferred items against the related receivables balances from those oems  specific resellers  distributors and specific international customers for which we defer revenue until payment is received 
in september  our board of directors authorized a one year stock repurchase program for up to five million shares of our common stock 
purchases will be made from time to time in the open market and will be funded from available working capital 
the number of shares to be purchased and the timing of purchases will be based on the level of our cash balances  general business and market conditions  and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
under this program  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in these shares were retired and reclassified as authorized and unissued shares of common stock 
we believe that our cash balances and the cash flows generated by operations will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
however  because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a decrease in customer demand or the acceptance of our products  we may not in the future be able to generate positive cash flows from operations 
if this occurred  we would require additional funds to support our working capital requirements  or for other purposes  and may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity financings or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any financing we obtain may dilute your ownership interests 
a portion of our cash may be used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of such businesses  products or technologies 

table of contents risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
our business could be harmed by any of these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and investors may lose all or part of their investment 
this section should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this form k 
the expected fluctuation of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to experience significant fluctuations or declines 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to also significantly fluctuate or experience declines 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the size and timing of customer orders  which can be affected by customer order deferrals in anticipation of future new product introductions or product enhancements and customer budgeting and purchasing cycles  the length and variability of our sales cycle for our products  particularly our analytic application suites and our new business intelligence platform  general economic and political conditions  which may affect our customers capital investment and information technology spending levels  market acceptance of our products  the mix of our products and services sold and the mix of distribution channels utilized  announcement  introduction or enhancement of our products or our competitors products and changes in our or our competitors pricing policies  our ability to develop  introduce and market new products on a timely basis  our success with our sales and marketing programs  technological changes in computer systems and environments  and increased competition from partnerships formed by our current and former partners and our competitors 
our product revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
historically  we have recognized a substantial portion of our revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter 
if customers cancel or delay orders it can have a material adverse impact on our revenues and results of operations for the quarter 
to the extent any such cancellations or delays are for large orders  this impact will be greater 
to the extent that the average size of our orders increases  customer cancellations or delays of orders will more likely harm our revenues and results of operations 
our quarterly product license revenues are difficult to forecast and are vulnerable to short term fluctuations in customer demand 
because we do not have a substantial backlog of orders  our license revenues generally reflect orders shipped in the same quarter they are received  and certain license revenues are dependent on cash collections from specific international customers and specific resellers 
our product license revenues are also difficult to forecast because the market for our products is rapidly evolving  and our sales cycles  which may last many months  vary substantially from customer to customer and vary in general due to a number of factors  some of which we have little or no control over  such as size and timing of individual license transactions  the closing of which tends to be delayed by customers until the end of a fiscal quarter as a 
table of contents negotiating tactic  potential for delay or deferral of customer implementations of our software  changes in customer budgets  seasonality of technology purchases  direct sales force effort to meet or exceed quarterly and year end quotas  lower european sales during the summer months  and other general economic and political conditions 
by comparison  our short term expense levels are relatively fixed and based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
the difficulty we have in predicting our quarterly revenue means revenue shortfalls may occur at some time  and our inability to adequately reduce short term expenses means such shortfalls will affect not only our revenue  but also our overall business  results of operations and financial condition 
due to the uncertainty surrounding our revenues  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
therefore  you should not take our quarterly results to be indicative of our future performance 
moreover  our future operating results may fall below the expectations of stock analysts and investors 
if this happens  the price of our common stock may fall 
general economic or political conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions 
because of the economic slowdown in the united states and in europe  and the terrorist events of september   companies in many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
we experienced the impact of the september  events in the fourth quarter of and the economic slowdown in and with reductions in capital expenditures by our end user customers  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of purchase commitments for our products and increased price competition 
in particular  these factors have negatively impacted the rate of market acceptance of our analytic applications 
as a result  if the current economic conditions in the us and europe continue or worsen  if a wider or global economic slowdown occurs  or if there is an escalation in regional or global conflicts  we may fall short of our revenue expectations for the first quarter of or for the entire year 
these conditions would negatively affect our business and results of operations 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could negatively affect the cash flow of our reseller customers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us 
this would increase our credit risk exposure  which would harm our financial condition 
changes in our product packaging may impact market acceptance of our products or adversely affect our results of operations 
we recently unbundled our analytic application suites in order to create smaller  modularized components  which may be licensed to customers on an individual basis 
the success of this new product packaging initiative is subject to significant risks  including the following customers may be confused by the change in the product packaging and may delay or defer purchases  our sales and marketing efforts may not be successful  sales of the new product packaging may result in lower transaction sizes  and if there is not a corresponding increase in unit volume  our revenues and margins may decrease  and we may experience difficulties in managing the modularization of the products in our research and development department or order management processes 
to the extent that we encounter or are unable to successfully manage any of the risks outlined above  our revenues and the results of our business operations may be adversely affected 
the lengthy sales cycle and implementation process of our products makes our revenues susceptible to fluctuations 
our sales cycle can be lengthy because the expense  complexity  broad functionality and company wide deployment of our products  particularly our analytic application suites  typically require executive level approval from our customers before they can purchase our products 
in addition  to successfully sell our 
table of contents products  we frequently must educate our potential customers about the full benefits of our products  which also can require significant time 
due to these factors  the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our products is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance review procedures  the timing of budget cycles  concerns about the introduction of our products or competitors new products  or potential downturns in general economic or political conditions 
further  our sales cycle may lengthen as we continue to focus our sales efforts on large corporations 
the implementation of our products  particularly our analytic application suites  can be a complex and time consuming process  the length and cost of which may be difficult to predict 
if our sales cycle and implementation process lengthens unexpectedly  it could adversely affect the timing of our revenues or increase costs  either of which may independently cause fluctuations in our revenue and results of operations 
if we are unable to accurately forecast revenues  it may harm our business or results of operations 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales personnel monitor the status of all proposals  including the date when they estimate that a customer will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
we aggregate these estimates periodically in order to generate a sales pipeline 
we compare the pipeline at various points in time to look for trends in our business 
while this pipeline analysis may provide us with some guidance in business planning and budgeting  these pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
additionally  because we have historically recognized a substantial portion of our license revenues in the last month of each quarter  and more recently  in the last few weeks of each quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure in a timely manner in response to variations in the conversion of the sales pipeline into license revenues 
any change in the conversion of the pipeline into customer sales or in the pipeline itself could cause us to improperly plan or budget and thereby adversely affect our business  financial conditions or results of operations 
in particular  the general economic slowdown has caused customer purchases to be reduced in amount  deferred or cancelled  and therefore has reduced the overall license pipeline conversion rates in and could continue to reduce the rate of conversion of the sales pipeline into license revenue in the future 
if the market in which we sell our products and services does not meet our expectations  it will adversely affect our revenues 
the market for software solutions  including enterprise analytic software  that enable more effective business decision making by helping companies aggregate and utilize data stored throughout an organization  is relatively new and still emerging 
substantially all of our revenues are attributable to the sale of products and services in this market 
if this market does not meet our forecasts at the rate we anticipate  we will not be able to sell as much of our software products and services  and our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
one of the reasons this market might not grow as we anticipate is that many companies are not yet fully aware of the benefits of using these software solutions to help make business decisions or the benefits of our specific product solutions 
as a result  we believe that only a limited number of large companies have deployed these software solutions 
although we have devoted and intend to continue to devote significant resources promoting market awareness of the benefits of these solutions  our efforts may be unsuccessful or insufficient 
the higher fees for  and potentially longer sales cycle of  our analytic application suites could be especially affected by the global economic slowdown  where larger transaction sizes receive closer scrutiny by our potential customers 

table of contents because we sell a limited number of products  if these products do not achieve broad market acceptance  our revenues will be adversely affected 
to date  substantially all of our revenues have been derived from our data integration products such as powercenter  powermart  powerconnect and related services  and to a lesser extent  our analytic application suites  data warehouse modules  business intelligence platform and related services 
we expect revenues derived from these products and related services to comprise substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
even if the emerging software market in which these products are sold grows substantially  if any of these products do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues could decrease 
in particular  we recently released our new business intelligence platform and new versions of our analytic application suites  and the degree of market acceptance for these products is currently uncertain 
market acceptance of our products could be affected if  among other things  competition substantially increases in the enterprise analytic software marketplace or transactional applications suppliers integrate their products to such a degree that the utility of the data integration functionality that our products provide is minimized or rendered unnecessary 
recent terrorist activities and resulting military and other actions could adversely affect our business 
the terrorist attacks on september   disrupted commerce throughout the world 
in response to attacks and other threats  the united states is actively contemplating and pursuing support for further military force to pursue those behind these attacks and is initiating broader actions against global terrorism 
the continued threat of terrorism throughout the world  the escalation of military action in afghanistan and  potentially  iraq  and heightened security measures in response to such threats may continue to cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in instability of capital markets  the imposition of further import and export restrictions  reductions in capital expenditures or spending on information technology  longer sales cycles  deferral or delay of customer orders  reductions of engineering resources  or an inability to effectively market our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
difficulties we may encounter managing our business could harm our results of operations 
in the past  we have experienced a period of rapid and substantial growth that has placed a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure and  if such growth resumes  will continue to place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure 
if such growth resumes and we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our business  results of operations or financial condition may be significantly harmed 
our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to improve our sales  operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures and hiring programs 
we may not be able to successfully implement improvements to our sales  customer support  management information and control systems in an efficient or timely manner  and we may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
we are continually implementing improvements to our control systems and have licensed technology from a third party to accomplish this objective 
we may experience difficulties in the implementation process or in connection with the third party software  which could divert our resources  including the attention of management 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe our success depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel and key members of our management team 
we currently do not have any key man life insurance relating to our key personnel  and their employment is at will and not subject to employment contracts 
we may not be successful in attracting  assimilating and retaining key personnel in the future 
specifically  diaz nesamoney  one of our founders  resigned as a director and president and chief operating officer in july  and kyle bowker resigned as executive vice president  worldwide field operations  in july we hired clive harrison in august as our new executive vice president  worldwide field operations 
these changes and the process of integrating mr 
harrison into the current management team may detract from our sales efforts and operations and have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents we expect seasonal trends to cause our quarterly revenues to fluctuate 
in recent years  there has been a relatively greater demand for our products in the fourth quarter than in each of the first three quarters of the year  particularly the first quarter  which often experiences less growth than other quarters 
as a result  we historically have experienced relatively higher bookings in the fourth quarter and relatively lighter bookings in the first quarter 
we believe that these fluctuations are caused by customer buying patterns often influenced by year end budgetary pressures and the efforts of our direct sales force to meet or exceed year end sales quotas 
in addition  european sales tend to be relatively lower during the summer months than during other periods 
due to the economic slowdown beginning in  our and quarterly revenues may not be indicative of seasonal trends that were experienced in prior years 
when the global economy recovers  we expect that seasonal trends may continue in the foreseeable future 
our stock price fluctuates as a result of factors other than our operating results 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including our operating results and the following the announcement of new products or product enhancements by our competitors  quarterly variations in our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  changes in recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  changes in accounting rules  such as the recording of expenses related to employee stock option grants  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology and emerging growth sectors have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
after periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
we and certain of our officers and directors are named as defendants in a purported class action complaint  which has been filed on behalf of certain persons who purchased our common stock between april  and december  the complaint seeks unspecified damages from alleged violations of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of see part ii  item legal proceedings 
such factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline  which may impact our operations 
we rely on third party technologies  and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
we intend to continue to license technologies that are developed and maintained by third parties  including applications used in our research and development activities and technologies  which are integrated into our products and services 
we rely on these third parties abilities to enhance their current technologies and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
if we cannot obtain  integrate or continue to license any of these technologies  we may experience a delay in product and service development until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
these technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
although we believe there are other sources for these technologies  any significant interruption in the supply of these technologies could adversely impact our business operations unless and until we can secure another source or develop our own equivalent technology 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any licensed technology into our products 
table of contents or services  which would harm our business and operating results 
third party licenses also expose us to increased risks that include risks of product malfunction after new technology is integrated  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  and our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs 
our products interoperate with a variety of third party technologies 
our products are designed to interoperate with and provide access to a wide range of third party developed and maintained hardware and software technologies  which are used by our customers 
the future design and development plans of the third parties that maintain these technologies are not within our control and may not be in line with our future product development plans 
we may also rely on such third parties to provide us with access to these technologies so that we can properly test and develop our products designed to interoperate with the third party technologies 
these third parties may in the future refuse or otherwise be unable to provide us with the necessary access to their technologies 
we may not be able to continue to ensure that our products will interoperate with or provide access to these third party developed technologies developed in the future  which may harm our business and operating results 
the market in which we sell our products is highly competitive 
the market for our products is highly competitive  quickly evolving and subject to rapidly changing technology 
many of our competitors or potential competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
we believe we currently compete more on the basis of our products functionality than on the basis of price 
if our competitors develop products with similar or superior functionality  we may have difficulty competing on the basis of price 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of our prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell products through these channels 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share or require us to reduce our prices  either of which could harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we compete principally against providers of data warehousing and analytic applications 
such competitors include ascential software corporation  broadbase software  inc  e 
piphany inc 
and sagent technology  inc 
in addition  we compete against business intelligence vendors  database vendors and enterprise application vendors that currently offer  or may develop  products with functionalities that compete with our solutions  such as brio technology  inc  business objects  cognos inc  hyperion solutions corporation and microstrategy  inc we also compete against certain database and enterprise application vendors  which offer products that typically operate specifically with these competitors proprietary databases 
such potential competitors include ibm  microsoft  oracle  peoplesoft  sap and siebel systems 
if we do not maintain and strengthen our relationships with our strategic partners  our ability to generate revenue and control implementation costs will be adversely affected 
we believe that our ability to increase the sales of our products and our future success will depend in part upon maintaining and strengthening successful relationships with our current or future strategic partners 
in addition to our direct sales force  we rely on established relationships with a variety of strategic partners  such as systems integrators  resellers and distributors  for marketing  licensing  implementing and supporting our 
table of contents products in the united states and internationally 
we also rely on relationships with strategic technology partners  such as enterprise resource planning providers and enterprise application providers  for the promotion and implementation of our solutions 
in particular  our ability to market our products depends substantially on our relationships with significant strategic partners  including accenture  deloitte consulting  hewlett packard  i technologies  ibm  kpmg consulting  mitsubishi electric  peoplesoft  pwc consulting  siebel systems and sybase 
in addition  our strategic partners may offer products of several different companies  including  in some cases  products that compete with our products 
we have limited control  if any  as to whether these strategic partners devote adequate resources to promoting  selling and implementing our products 
we may not be able to maintain our strategic partnerships or attract sufficient additional strategic partners who are able to market our products effectively  who are qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service or who have the technical expertise and personnel resources necessary to implement our products for our customers 
in particular  if our strategic partners do not devote resources to implement our products  we may incur substantial additional costs associated with hiring and training additional qualified technical personnel to timely implement solutions for our customers 
furthermore  our relationships with our strategic partners may not generate enough revenue to offset the significant resources used to develop these relationships 
our distribution channels may create additional risks 
we have a number of relationships with resellers  systems integrators and distributors which assist us in obtaining broad market coverage for our products and services 
we have generally avoided exclusive relationships with resellers and distributors of our products 
our discount policies  sales commission structure and reseller licensing programs are intended to support each distribution channel with a minimum level of channel conflicts 
any failure to minimize potential channel conflicts could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
any significant defect in our products could cause us to lose revenue and expose us to product liability claims 
the software products we offer are inherently complex and despite extensive testing and quality control  have in the past and may in the future contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced 
these defects and errors could cause damage to our reputation  loss of revenue  product returns  order cancellations or lack of market acceptance of our products  and as a result  harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we have in the past and may in the future need to issue corrective releases of our software products to fix these defects or errors 
for example  we issued corrective releases to fix problems with the version of our powermart released in the first quarter of as a result  we had to allocate significant customer support resources to address these problems 
our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims 
the limitation of liability provisions contained in our license agreements  however  may not be effective as a result of existing or future national  federal  state or local laws or ordinances or unfavorable judicial decisions 
although we have not experienced any product liability claims to date  the sale and support of our products entails the risk of such claims  which could be substantial in light of the use of our products in enterprise wide environments 
if a claimant successfully brings a product liability claim against us  it would likely significantly harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
technological advances and evolving industry standards could adversely impact our future product sales 
the market for our products is characterized by continuing technological development  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products by our direct competitors or others embodying new technologies  the emergence of new industry standards or changes in customer requirements could render our existing products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
in particular  an industry wide adoption of uniform open standards across heterogeneous applications could minimize the importance of the integration functionality of our products and materially adversely affect the competitiveness 
table of contents and market acceptance of our products 
our success depends upon our ability to enhance existing products  to respond to changing customer requirements and to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological and competitive developments and emerging industry standards 
we have in the past experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements and may experience similar delays in the future 
as a result  in the past  some of our customers deferred purchasing the powermart product until the next upgrade was released 
future delays or problems in the installation or implementation of our new releases may cause customers to forego purchases of our products and purchase those of our competitors instead 
failure to develop and introduce new products  or enhancements to existing products  in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  will materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we recognize revenue from specific customers at the time we receive payment for our products  and if these customers do not make timely payment  our revenues could decrease 
based on limited credit history  we recognize revenue from direct end users  resellers  distributors and oems which have not been deemed credit worthy at the time we receive payment for our products  rather than at the time of sale 
if these customers do not make timely payment for our products  our revenues could decrease 
if our revenues decrease  the price of our common stock may fall 
we have a limited operating history and a history of losses  and we may not be able to achieve profitable operations 
we were incorporated in and began selling our products in  therefore  we have a limited operating history upon which investors can evaluate our operations  products and prospects 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception  and we may not consistently achieve profitability 
our international operations expose us to greater intellectual property  collections  exchange rate fluctuations  regulatory and other risks  which could limit our future growth 
our international operations face numerous risks 
our products must be localized customized to meet local user needs in order to be sold in particular foreign countries 
developing local versions of our products for foreign markets is difficult and can take longer than we anticipate 
we currently have limited experience in localizing products and in testing whether these localized products will be accepted in the targeted countries 
we cannot assure you that our localization efforts will be successful 
in addition  we have only a limited history of marketing  selling and supporting our products and services internationally 
as a result  we must hire and train experienced personnel to staff and manage our foreign operations 
however  we may experience difficulties in recruiting and training an international staff 
we must also be able to enter into strategic relationships with companies in international markets 
if we are not able to maintain successful strategic relationships internationally or recruit additional companies to enter into strategic relationships  our future success in these international markets could be limited 
our international business is subject to a number of risks  including the following greater difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  sales seasonality  greater risk of uncollectible accounts  longer collection cycles  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property  potential unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  potential unexpected changes in tax laws and treaties  
table of contents the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business because we do not engage in any hedging activities  and general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets 
we may encounter difficulties predicting the extent of the future impact of these conditions 
these factors and other factors could harm our ability to gain future international revenues and  consequently  materially impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may expand our international operations in the future  and as a result  we may face significant additional risks 
our failure to manage our international operations and the associated risks effectively could limit the future growth of our business 
the expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we believe that our product developments  product enhancements  name recognition and the technological and innovative skills of our personnel are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
however  these legal rights and contractual agreements may provide only limited protection 
our pending patent applications may not be allowed or our competitors may successfully challenge the validity or scope of any of our six issued patents or any future issued patents 
our patents alone may not provide us with any significant competitive advantage  and third parties may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around our patents 
third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
we cannot easily monitor any unauthorized use of our products  and  although we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy is a prevalent problem in our industry in general 
the risk of not adequately protecting our proprietary technology and our exposure to competitive pressures may be increased if a competitor should resort to unlawful means in competing against us 
we are currently investigating whether one or more former employees  recruited and hired by a competitor  may have misappropriated our trade secrets  including sensitive products and marketing information and detailed sales information regarding existing and potential customers and unlawfully used that information to benefit the competitor in gaining a competitive advantage against us 
we have entered into agreements with many of our customers and partners that require us to place the source code of our products into escrow 
such agreements generally provide that such parties will have a limited  non exclusive right to use such code if i there is a bankruptcy proceeding by or against us  ii we cease to do business  or iii we fail to meet our support obligations 
although our agreements with these third parties limit the scope of rights to use of the source code  we may be unable to effectively control such third party s actions 
furthermore  effective protection of intellectual property rights is unavailable or limited in various foreign countries 
the protection of our proprietary rights may be inadequate and our competitors could independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we may be forced to initiate litigation in order to protect our proprietary rights 
for example  on july   we filed a patent infringement lawsuit against acta technology  inc see part ii  item  legal proceedings 
although this lawsuit is in the early stages  litigating claims related to the enforcement of proprietary rights can be very expensive and can be burdensome in terms of management time and resources  which could adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
as is common in the software industry  we have received and may continue from time to time to receive notices from third parties claiming infringement by our products of third party patent and other proprietary rights 
third parties could claim that our current or future products infringe their patent or other proprietary rights 
as the number of software products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
although we do not believe that we are currently infringing any proprietary rights of others  legal action claiming patent infringement could be commenced against us  and we may not prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
the potential effects on our business that may result from a third party infringement claim include the following we may be forced to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may be required to indemnify our customers or obtain replacement products or functionality for our customers  we may be forced to significantly increase our development efforts and resources to redesign our products as a result of these claims  and we may be forced to discontinue the sale of some or all of our products 
our business could suffer as a result of our strategic acquisitions and investments 
in december  we acquired influence  a developer of analytic applications 
in february  we acquired delphi  a distributor of our products in switzerland 
in august  we acquired zimba  a provider of applications that enable mobile professionals to have real time access to enterprise and external information through wireless devices  voice recognition technologies and the internet 
in april  we acquired certain pwc intellectual property rights and personnel 
in november  we acquired certain intellectual property from qrb developers 
in january  we acquired syn t sys  a distributor of our products in the netherlands and belgium 
in june  we acquired informatica partners  a distributor of our products in france 
our attempts to effectively integrate these companies  their intellectual property  or their personnel  have placed an additional burden on our management and infrastructure 
these acquisitions will subject us to a number of risks  including the loss of key personnel  customers and business relationships  difficulties associated with assimilating and integrating the technology  new personnel and operations of the acquired company  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the expense associated with maintenance of uniform standards  controls  procedures  employees and clients  the risk of product malfunction after new technology is integrated  the diversion of resources from the development of our own proprietary technology  our inability to generate revenue from new technology sufficient to offset associated acquisition and maintenance costs  and the risk of long lived asset impairment write offs 

table of contents there can be no assurance that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage these risks  our business  operating results or financial condition may be negatively impacted 
we may engage in future acquisitions or investments that could dilute our existing stockholders  or cause us to incur contingent liabilities  debt or significant expense 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may evaluate potential acquisitions of  or investments in  related businesses  products or technologies 
future acquisitions could result in the issuance of dilutive equity securities  the incurrence of debt or contingent liabilities 
there can be no assurance that any strategic acquisition or investment will succeed 
any future acquisition or investment could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future  which may not be available on reasonable terms to us  if at all 
we may not generate sufficient revenue from operations to offset our operating or other expenses 
as a result  in the future  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
we may not be able to borrow money or sell more of our equity securities to meet our cash needs 
even if we are able to do so  it may not be on terms that are favorable or reasonable to us 
if we are not able to raise additional capital when we need it in the future  our business could be seriously harmed 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of informatica or a change in our management 
in addition  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan 
under the plan  we issued a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record as of november   and such rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events 
because the rights may substantially dilute the stock ownership of a person or group attempting to take us over without the approval of our board of directors  the plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or a significant percentage of our outstanding capital stock without first negotiating with our board of directors regarding such acquisition 
our bylaws provide that we have a classified board of directors  with each class of directors subject to re election every three years 
this classified board has the effect of making it more difficult for third parties to insert their representatives on our board of directors and gain control of informatica 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure and other events beyond our control 
we do not have a detailed disaster recovery plan 
our facilities in the state of california are currently subject to electrical blackouts as a consequence of a shortage of available electrical power  which occurred during in the event these blackouts are reinstated  they could disrupt the operations of our affected facilities 
in connection with the shortage of available power  prices for electricity may continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
such price changes will increase our operating costs  which could in turn hurt our profitability 
in addition  we do not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur  and any losses or damages incurred by us could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist primarily of commercial paper  government notes and bonds  corporate bonds and municipal securities 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
as of december   the average rate of return on our investments was 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by from the market interest rates at december  would not cause the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and investments to change by a material amount 
declines in interest rates will  over time  reduce our interest income 
foreign currency risk we market and sell our software and services through our direct sales force in the united states as well as belgium  canada  france  germany  the netherlands  switzerland and the united kingdom 
we also have relationships with distributors in various regions  including asia pacific  australia  europe  japan and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as our sales are primarily in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes and currency fluctuations may have a quarterly impact on our financial results 
to date  we have not engaged in any foreign currency hedging activities
