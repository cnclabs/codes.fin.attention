strategic alliances the company actively seeks strategic relationships with companies to build its developing partner ecosystem 
the partner ecosystem is built by establishing relationships in three basic areas consisting of software and technology solution partners  system integration partners and niche market partners 
these relationships will enhance the company s technological strength  improve its market position  facilitate shorter time to market  enhance its ability to deliver end to end solutions  and broaden its market coverage 
during the third quarter of fiscal year intervoice entered into a new strategic alliance agreement with microsoft 
the alliance is multi faceted  encompassing joint technology initiatives  joint marketing strategies and joint go to market initiatives 
the partnership was formed to help make speech recognition solutions mainstream through the implementation of salt standards based solutions incorporated in microsoft s operating software 
the two companies will collaborate and integrate technology  and intervoice will build some of its voice solutions based on the combined technology 
intervoice is actively seeking additional relationships with partners for the delivery of solutions based on additional emerging open  standards based solutions 
the company also has relationships with several speech technology leaders  including nuance  scansoft and speechworks 
these relationships allow intervoice to integrate speech recognition technologies with core intervoice technologies to implement fully integrated speech solutions 
intervoice maintains an active relationship with sun microsystems for the delivery of its products targeted to the network operators and has also established a relationship with hp for server technology to support the omvia media server product line 
in addition  during fiscal intervoice also established a relationship with bea  one of the leading jee application server suppliers  for the advancement of voicexml based speech recognition solutions 
these relationships and others allow intervoice to act as a complete systems integrator for the voice solutions marketplace 
the company also has strategic relationships with major telecommunications equipment suppliers such as ericsson and siemens who participate in joint sales opportunities around the world 
backlog the company s systems backlog at february   and  which does not include the contracted value of future maintenance and managed services to be recognized by the company  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the company expects all existing backlog to be delivered within fiscal due to customer demand  some of the company s sales are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
thus  the company s backlog at any particular date may not be indicative of actual sales for any future period 
research and development research and development expenses were approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively  and included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company s research and development spending is focused in four key areas 
first  software tools are being developed to aid in the development  deployment and management of customer applications incorporating speech recognition and text to speech technologies 
next  hardware and software platforms are being developed which interface with telephony networks and an enterprise s internal data network 
such platforms are being developed to operate in traditional enterprise networks as well as newer network environments such as jee and microsoft s 
net 
third  voice browsers based on open standards such as salt and voicexml are being developed 
voice browsers incorporate speech recognition technologies and perform the task of formatting a user s verbal query into an inquiry that can be acted upon and or responded to by an enterprise system 
finally  research and development activities are focusing on modularization of key hardware and software elements 
this is increasingly important in a standards based  open systems architecture as modularization will allow for interchange of commodity elements to reduce overall systems cost and for the company s best of breed and core technology strengths to be leveraged into new applications and vertical markets 
the company expects to maintain a strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its markets  which is essential to the continued improvement of the company s position in the industry 
proprietary rights the company believes that its existing patent  copyright  license and other proprietary rights in its products and technologies are material to the conduct of its business 
to protect these proprietary rights  the company relies on a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret  copyright and other proprietary rights laws  nondisclosure safeguards and license agreements 
as of february   the company owned patents and had pending applications for patents in the united states 
in addition  the company has registered intervoice as a trademark in the united states 
currently  in the united states  the company has registered trademarks and service marks and three pending applications for such marks 
some of the company s patents and marks are also registered in certain foreign countries 
the company also has four registered copyrights and one pending application for a copyright in the united states 
the company s software and other products are generally licensed to customers pursuant to a nontransferable license agreement that restricts the use of the software and other products to the customer s internal purposes 
although the company s license agreements prohibit a customer from disclosing proprietary information contained in the company s products to any other person  it is technologically possible for competitors of the company to copy aspects of the company s products in violation of the company s rights 
furthermore  even in cases where patents are granted  the detection and policing of the unauthorized use of the patented technology is difficult 
moreover  judicial enforcement of copyrights may be uncertain  particularly in foreign countries 
the occurrence of the unauthorized use of the company s proprietary information by the company s competitors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company provides its customers a qualified indemnity against the infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
from time to time various owners of patents and copyrighted works send the company or its customers letters alleging that the company s products do or might infringe upon the owners intellectual property rights  and or suggesting that the company or its customers should negotiate a license or cross license agreement with the owner 
the company s policy is to never knowingly infringe upon any third party s intellectual property rights 
accordingly  the company forwards any such allegation or licensing request to its outside legal counsel for their review and opinion 
the company generally attempts to resolve any such matter by informing the owner of its position concerning non infringement or invalidity  and or  if appropriate  negotiating a license or cross license agreement 
even though the company attempts to resolve these matters without litigation  it is always possible that the owner of the patent or copyrighted works will institute litigation 
owners of patent s and or copyrighted work s have previously instituted litigation against the company alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights  although no such litigation is currently pending against the company 
as noted above  the company currently has a portfolio of patents  and it has applied for and will continue to apply for and receive a number of additional patents to reflect its technological innovations 
the company believes that its patent portfolio could allow it to assert counterclaims for infringement against certain owners of intellectual property rights if those owners were to sue the company for infringement 
in certain situations  it might be beneficial for the company to cross license certain of its patents for other patents which are relevant to the call automation industry 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain patent matters 
the company believes that software and technology companies  including the company and others in the company s industry  increasingly may become subject to infringement claims 
such claims may require the company to enter into costly license agreements  or result in even more costly litigation 
to the extent the company requires a licensing arrangement  the arrangement may not be available at all  or  if available  may be very expensive or even prohibitively expensive 
as with any legal proceeding  there is no guarantee that the company will prevail in any litigation instituted against the company asserting infringement of intellectual property rights 
to the extent the company suffers an adverse judgment  it might have to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  repurchase infringing products from the company s customers pursuant to indemnity obligations  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to the intellectual property that has been infringed upon 
as with licensing arrangements  non infringing substitute technologies may not be available  and if available  may be very expensive  or even prohibitively expensive  to implement 
accordingly  for all of the foregoing reasons  a claim of infringement could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing and facilities the company s manufacturing operations consist primarily of the final assembly  integration and extensive testing and quality control of subassemblies  host computer platforms  operating software and the company s run time software 
the company currently uses third parties to perform printed circuit board assembly  sheet metal fabrication and customer site service and repair 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  some of its components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments and at t corp  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  the company licenses speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
as the company continues to migrate to open  standards based systems  it will become increasingly dependent on its component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner 
if the company s significant vendors are unable or cease to supply components or licenses at current levels  the company may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
consequently  the company would be unable to provide products and to service its customers or generate historical operating margins  which would negatively impact its business and operating results

item legal proceedings intellectual property matters from time to time ronald a 
katz technology licensing lp raktl has sent letters to certain customers of the company suggesting that the customer should negotiate a license agreement to cover the practice of certain patents owned by raktl 
in the letters  raktl has alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain enhanced services offered by network providers  including prepaid card and wireless services and postpaid card services 
raktl has further alleged that certain of its patents pertain to certain call processing applications  including applications for call centers that route calls using a called party s dnis identification number 
as a result of the correspondence  an increasing number of the company s customers have had discussions  or are in discussions  with raktl 
certain products offered by the company can be programmed and configured to provide enhanced services to network providers and call processing applications for call centers 
the company s contracts with customers usually include a qualified obligation to indemnify and defend customers against claims that products as delivered by the company infringe a third party s patent 
none of the company s customers have notified the company that raktl has claimed that any product provided by the company infringes any claims of any raktl patent 
accordingly  the company has not been required to defend any customers against a claim of infringement under a raktl patent 
the company has  however  received letters from customers notifying the company of the efforts by raktl to license its patent portfolio and reminding the company of its potential obligations under the indemnification provisions of the applicable agreements in the event that a claim is asserted 
in response to correspondence from raktl  a few customers have attempted to tender to the company the defense of its products under contractual indemnity provisions 
the company has informed these customers that while it fully intends to honor any contractual indemnity provisions  it does not believe it currently has any obligation to provide such a defense because raktl does not appear to have made a claim that a company product infringes a patent 
some of these customers have disagreed with the company and believe that the correspondence from raktl can be construed as claim s against the company s products 
an affiliate of verizon communications  inc  cellco partnership d b a verizon wireless  recently settled all claims of patent infringement asserted against it in the matter of raktl v 
verizon communications  inc et al  no 
cv  in us district court  eastern district of pennsylvania 
verizon wireless had previously notified the company of the lawsuit and referenced provisions in a contract for prepaid services which required a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  brite voice systems inc  to indemnify verizon wireless against claims that its services infringe patents 
the clams in the lawsuit made general reference to prepaid services and a variety of other services offered by verizon wireless and its affiliates but did not refer to brite s products or services 
the company had informed verizon wireless that it could find no basis for an indemnity obligation under the expired contract and  accordingly  the company did not participate in the defense or settlement of the matter 
even though raktl has not alleged that a product provided by the company infringes a raktl patent  it is always possible that raktl may do so 
in the event that a company product becomes the subject of litigation  a customer could attempt to invoke the company s indemnity obligations under the applicable agreement 
as with most sales contracts with suppliers of computerized equipment  the company s contractual indemnity obligations are generally limited to the products and services provided by the company  and generally require the customer to allow the company to have control over any litigation and settlement negotiations with the patent holder 
the customers who have received letters from raktl generally have multiple suppliers of the types of products that might potentially be subject to claims by raktl 
even though no claims have been made that a specific product offered by the company infringes any claim under the raktl patent portfolio  the company has received opinions from its outside patent counsel that certain products and applications offered by the company do not infringe certain claims of the raktl patents 
the company has also received opinions from its outside counsel that certain claims under the raktl patent portfolio are invalid or unenforceable 
furthermore  based on the reviews by outside counsel  the company is not aware of any valid and enforceable claims under the raktl portfolio that are infringed by the company s products 
if the company does become involved in litigation in connection with the raktl patent portfolio  under a contractual indemnity or any other legal theory  the company intends to vigorously contest the claims and to assert appropriate defenses 
an increasing number of companies  including some large  well known companies and some customers of the company  have already licensed certain rights under the raktl patent portfolio 
raktl has previously announced license agreements with  among others  at t corp  microsoft corporation and international business machines corporation 
in the matter of aerotel  ltd 
et al  v 
sprint corporation  et al  cause no 
civ sas  pending in the united states district court  southern district of new york  aerotel  ltd  has sued sprint corporation alleging that certain prepaid services offered by sprint are infringing aerotel s us patent no 
 patent 
according to sprint  the suit originally focused on land line prepaid services not provided by the company 
as part of an unsuccessful mediation effort  aerotel also sought compensation for certain prepaid wireless services provided to sprint pcs by the company 
as a result of the mediation effort  sprint has requested that the company provide a defense and indemnification to aerotel s infringement claims  to the extent that they pertain to any wireless prepaid services offered by the company 
in response to this request  the company offered to assist and has in fact been assisting sprint s counsel in defending against such claims  to the extent they deal with issues unique to the system and services provided by the company 
sprint has asserted  among other things  that intervoice should reimburse sprint for legal expenses sprint incurs in connection with defending the wireless services 
the trial court  which had temporarily stayed proceedings  recently recommenced proceedings following certain rulings from the united states patent and trademark office 
the company has received opinions from its outside patent counsel that the wireless prepaid services offered by the company do not infringe the patent 
aerotel has filed expert reports that assert that wireless services provided by the company are covered under claim of the patent 
sprint has filed its own expert report rebutting aerotel s expert

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary disclosures to qualify forward looking statements this report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this form k  including  without limitation  statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to consolidated financial statements located elsewhere herein regarding the company s financial position  business strategy  plans and objectives of management of the company for future operations  and industry conditions  are forward looking statements 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to important factors described elsewhere in this report  the company cautions current and potential investors that the following important risk factors  among others  sometimes have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause such results during fiscal  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company the company has experienced recent operating losses and may not operate profitably in the future 
the company incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company may continue to incur losses  which could hinder the company s ability to operate its current business 
the company may not be able to generate sufficient revenues from its operations to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
the company is obligated to make periodic payments of principal and interest under its financing agreements 
the company has material indebtedness outstanding under a mortgage loan secured by the company s office facilities in dallas  texas and under a senior secured term loan facility 
the company is required to make periodic payments of interest under each of these financing agreements and  in the case of the term loan  periodic payments of principal 
the company may  from time to time  have additional indebtedness outstanding under its revolving credit facility 
if the company at any time defaults on any of its payment obligations or other obligations under any financing agreement  the creditors under the applicable agreement will have all rights available under the agreement  including acceleration  termination and enforcement of security interests 
the financing agreements also have certain qualified cross default provisions  particularly for acceleration of indebtedness under any one of the financing agreements 
under such circumstances  the company s cash position and liquidity would be severely impacted  and it is possible the company would not be able to pay its debts as they come due 
the company s financing agreements include significant financial and operating covenants and default provisions 
in addition to the payment obligations  the company s senior secured term loan and revolving credit facility and its mortgage loan facility contain significant financial covenants  operating covenants and default provisions 
if the company does not comply with any of these covenants and default provisions  the company s secured lenders can accelerate all indebtedness outstanding under the facilities and foreclose on substantially all of the company s assets 
in order for the company to comply with the escalating minimum ebitda requirements in its senior secured credit facility  the company will have to continue to increase revenues and or lower expenses in future quarters 
general business activity has declined 
the company s sales are largely dependent on the strength of the domestic and international economies and  in particular  on demand for telecommunications equipment  computers  software and other technology products 
the market for telecommunications equipment has declined sharply over the last three years  and the markets for computers  software and other technology products also have declined 
in addition  there is concern that demand for the types of products offered by the company will remain soft for some period of time as a result of domestic and global economic and political conditions 
the company is prone to quarterly sales fluctuations 
some of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in the company s quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
the company s accuracy in estimating future sales is largely dependent on its ability to successfully qualify  estimate and close system sales from its pipeline of sales opportunities during a quarter 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
accordingly  the company s actual sales for any fiscal reporting period may be significantly different from any estimate of sales for such period 
see the discussion entitled sales in this item for a discussion of the company s system for estimating sales and trends in its business 
the company is subject to potential and pending lawsuits and other claims 
the company is subject to certain potential and pending lawsuits and other claims discussed in item legal proceedings 
the company believes that each of the pending lawsuits to which it is subject is without merit and intends to defend each matter vigorously 
the company may not prevail in any or all of the litigation or other matters 
an adverse judgment in any of these matters  as well as the company s expenses relating to its defense of a given matter  could have consequences materially adverse to the company 
the company faces intense competition based on product capabilities and experiences ever increasing demands from its actual and prospective customers for its products to be compatible with a variety of rapidly proliferating computing  telephony and computer networking technologies and standards 
the ultimate success of the company s products is dependent  to a large degree  on the company allocating its resources to developing and improving products compatible with those technologies  standards and functionalities that ultimately become widely accepted by the company s actual and prospective customers 
the company s success is also dependent  to a large degree  on the company s ability to implement arrangements with other vendors with complementary product offerings to provide actual and prospective customers greater functionality and to ensure that the company s products are compatible with the increased variety of technologies and standards 
the principal competitors for the company s systems include avaya  ibm  nortel  aspect communications  security first  comverse technology  lucent technologies and unisys 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  technological and marketing resources than the company has 
although the company has committed substantial resources to enhance its existing products and to develop and market new products  it may not be successful 
the company may not be able to retain its customer base and  in particular  its more significant customers  such as o the company s success depends substantially on retaining its significant customers 
the loss of one of the company s significant customers could negatively impact the company s results of operations 
the company s installed base of customers generally is not contractually obligated to place further systems orders with the company or to extend their services contracts with the company at the expiration of their current contracts 
sales to o  formerly bt cellnet  which purchases both systems and managed services from the company  accounted for approximately  and of the company s total sales during fiscal  and  respectively 
under the terms of its recently extended managed services contract with o and at current exchange rates  the company will recognize revenues of approximately million per month through july  and million per month from august through the end of the contract in july the amounts received under the agreement may vary based on future changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and the british pound 
the company may not be successful in transitioning its products and services to an open  standards based business model 
the company has historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software systems using internally developed components to address its customers total business needs 
increasingly  the markets for the company s products are requiring a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s r 
net environments utilizing voicexml and or salt standards 
such an open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  the company believes it may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on its development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift will place new challenges on the company s management to transition its products and to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled systems 
if the company is unsuccessful in resolving one or more of these challenges  the company s revenues and profitability could decline 
the company will incur substantial expenses to transition its products and services to an open  standards based business model 
the company anticipates that it will incur substantial research and development expenses and other expenses to adapt its organization and product and service offerings to an open  standards based business model 
if the company is unable to accurately estimate the future expenses associated with these strategic initiatives  or if the company must divert its resources to fund other strategic or operational obligations  the company s ability to fund the strategic initiatives and to operate profitably will be adversely affected 
the company s reliance on significant vendor relationships could result in significant expense or an inability to serve its customers if it loses these relationships 
although the company generally uses standard parts and components for its products  some of its components  including semi conductors and  in particular  digital signal processors manufactured by texas instruments and at t corp  are available only from a small number of vendors 
likewise  the company licenses speech recognition technology from a small number of vendors 
as the company continues to migrate to open  standards based systems  it will become increasingly dependent on its component suppliers and software vendors 
to date  the company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of needed components and licenses in a timely manner 
if the company s significant vendors are unable or cease to supply components or licenses at current levels  the company may not be able to obtain these items from another source or at historical prices 
consequently  the company would be unable to provide products and to service its customers or to generate historical operating margins  which would negatively impact its business and operating results 
if third parties assert claims that the company s products or services infringe on their technology and related intellectual property rights  whether the claims are made directly against the company or against the company s customers  the company could incur substantial costs to defend these claims 
if any of these claims is ultimately successful  a third party could require the company to pay substantial damages  discontinue the use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to acquire non infringing alternatives  and or obtain licenses to use the infringed intellectual property rights 
moreover  where the claims are asserted with respect to the company s customers  additional expenses may be involved in indemnifying the customer and or designing and providing non infringing products 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of certain pending and potential claims of infringement 
the company is exposed to risks related to its international operations that could increase its costs and hurt its business 
the company s products are currently sold in more than countries 
the company s international sales  as a percentage of total company sales  were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
international sales are subject to certain risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the difficulty and expense of maintaining foreign offices and distribution channels  tariffs and other barriers to trade  greater difficulty in protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights  general economic and political conditions in each country  loss of revenue  property and equipment from expropriation  import and export licensing requirements  and additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  including risks arising from customers speaking different languages and having different cultural approaches to the conduct of business 
the company s inability to properly estimate costs under fixed price contracts could negatively impact its profitability 
some of the company s contracts to develop application software and customized systems provide for the customer to pay a fixed price for its products and services regardless of whether the company s costs to perform under the contract exceed the amount of the fixed price 
if the company is unable to estimate accurately the amount of future costs under these fixed price contracts  or if unforeseen additional costs must be incurred to perform under these contracts  the company s ability to operate profitably under these contracts may be adversely affected 
the company has realized significant losses under certain customer contracts in the past and may experience similar significant losses in the future 
the company s inability to meet contracted performance targets could subject it to significant penalties 
many of the company s contracts  particularly for managed services  foreign contracts and contracts with telecommunication companies  include provisions for the assessment of liquidated damages for delayed project completion and or for the company s failure to achieve certain minimum service levels 
the company has had to pay liquidated damages in the past and may have to pay additional liquidated damages in the future 
any such future liquidated damages could be significant 
increasing consolidation in the telecommunications and financial industries could affect the company s revenues and profitability 
the majority of the company s significant customers are in the telecommunications and financial industries  which are undergoing increasing consolidation as a result of merger and acquisition activity 
this activity involving the company s significant customers could decrease the number of customers purchasing the company s products and or delay purchases of the company s products by customers that are in the process of reviewing their strategic alternatives in light of a pending merger or acquisition 
if the company has fewer customers or its customers delay purchases of the company s products as a result of merger and acquisition activity  the company s revenues and profitability could decline 
any failure by the company to satisfy its registration  listing and other obligations with respect to the common stock underlying certain warrants could result in adverse consequences 
subject to certain exceptions  the company is required to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement that became effective june  covering the common stock underlying certain warrants to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock at a price of per share until the earlier of the date the underlying common stock may be resold pursuant to rule k under the securities act of or the date on which the sale of all the underlying common stock is completed 
the company is subject to various penalties for failure to meet its registration obligations and the related stock exchange listing for the underlying common stock  including cash penalties 
the warrants are also subject to anti dilution adjustments 
the occurrence of force majeure events could impact the company s results from operations 
the occurrence of one or more of the following events could potentially cause the company to incur significant losses acts of god  war  riot  embargoes  acts of civil or military authorities  acts of terrorism or sabotage  shortage of supply or delay in delivery by intervoice s vendors  the spread of sars or other diseases  fire  flood  explosion  earthquake  accident  strikes  radiation  inability to secure transportation  failure of communications  failure of utilities or similar events

see other income expense under item critical accounting policies in preparing its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company uses statistical analyses  estimates and projections that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures and that may vary from actual results 
the company considers the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware and software systems  from the delivery of maintenance and other customer services associated with installed systems and from the provision of its enhanced telecommunications services and ivr applications on an asp managed service basis 
the company s policies for revenue recognition follow the guidance in statement of position no 
software revenue recognition  as amended sop  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
the company adopted sab effective march  see item  note d change in accounting principle for revenue recognition which describes the impact of that change on the fiscal operating results 
if contracts include multiple elements  each element of the arrangement is separately identified and accounted for based on the relative fair value of such element 
revenue is not recognized on any element of the arrangement if undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
sale of hardware and software systems many of the company s sales are of customized software or customized hardware software systems 
such systems incorporate newly designed software and or standard building blocks of hardware and software which have been significantly modified  configured and assembled to match unique customer requirements defined at the beginning of each project 
sales of these customized systems are accounted for using contract accounting principles under either the percentage of completion poc or completed contract methodology as further described below 
in other instances  particularly in situations where the company sells to distributors or where the company is supplying only additional product capacity ie  similar hardware and software systems to what is already in place for an existing customer  the company may sell systems that do not require significant customization 
in those situations  revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
typically  this is at shipment when there is no installation obligation or at the completion of minor post shipment installation obligations 
generally  the company uses poc accounting for its more complex custom systems 
in determining whether a particular sale qualifies for poc treatment  the company considers multiple factors including the value of the contract  the anticipated duration of the contract performance period  and the degree of customization inherent in the project 
projects normally must have an aggregate value of more than  to qualify for poc treatment 
for a project accounted for under the poc method  the company recognizes revenue as work progresses over the life of the project based on a comparison of actual labor inputs labor hours worked to current estimates of total labor inputs required to complete the project 
project estimates are reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
the terms of most poc projects require customers to make interim progress payments during the course of the project based on the company s completion of contractually defined milestones 
such payments and a written customer acknowledgement at the completion of the project  usually following a final customer test phase  document the customer s acceptance of the project 
in some circumstances  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the system in a live operating environment may also constitute final acceptance of a project 
the company uses completed contract accounting for smaller custom projects not meeting the poc thresholds described above 
the company also uses completed contract accounting in situations where the technical requirements of a project are so complex or are so dependent on the development of new technologies or the unique application of existing technologies that the company s ability to make reasonable estimates is in doubt or where a sale is subject to unusual inherent hazards that make the company s estimates doubtful 
such hazards are unrelated to  or only incidentally related to  the company s typical activities and include situations where the enforceability of a contract is suspect  completion of the contract is subject to pending litigation  or where the systems produced are subject to condemnation or expropriation risks 
these latter situations are extremely rare 
for all completed contract sales  the company recognizes revenue upon customer acceptance as evidenced by a written customer acknowledgement  the passage of a contractually defined time period or the customer s use of the system in a live operating environment 
the company generates a significant percentage of its sales  particularly sales of enhanced telecommunications services systems  outside the united states 
customers in certain countries are subject to significant economic and political challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  the company may offer selected customers such payment terms 
in all cases  however  the company only recognizes revenue at such time as its system or service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in some limited cases  this policy may result in the company recognizing revenue on a cash basis  limiting revenue recognition on certain sales of systems and or services to the actual cash received to date from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied 
sale of maintenance and other customer services the company recognizes revenue from maintenance and other customer services when the services are performed or ratably over the related contract period 
all significant costs and expenses associated with maintenance contracts are expensed as incurred 
this approximates a ratable recognition of expenses over the contract period 
sale of managed services the company can provide enhanced communications solutions to customers on an outsourced basis through its asp managed service business 
while specific arrangements can vary  the company generally builds a customized computer system to address a specific customer s business need and then owns  monitors  and maintains that system  ensuring that it processes the customer s business transactions in accordance with defined specifications 
for its services  the company generally receives a one time setup fee paid at the beginning of the contract and a service fee paid monthly over the life of the contract 
most contracts range from to months in length 
the company combines the setup fee and the total service fee to be received from the customer and recognizes revenue ratably over the term of the asp contract 
the company capitalizes the cost of the computer system s used to provide the service and depreciates such systems over the contract life for assets unique to the individual contract or the life of the equipment for assets common to the general managed service operations 
all labor and other period costs required to provide the service are expensed as incurred 
loss contracts the company updates its estimates of the costs necessary to complete all customer contracts in process on a quarterly basis 
whenever current estimates indicate that the company will incur a loss on the completion of a contract  the company immediately records a provision for such loss as part of the current period cost of goods sold 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
inventories are recorded at standard cost which approximates actual cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the company periodically reviews its inventories for unsaleable or obsolete items and for items held in excess quantities based on current and projected usage 
adjustments are made where necessary to reduce the carrying value of individual items to reflect the lower of cost or market  and any such adjustments create a new carrying value for the affected items 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets intangible assets are comprised of separately identifiable intangible assets arising out of the company s fiscal acquisition of brite voice systems  inc  and certain capitalized purchased software 
intangible assets are being amortized using the straight line method over each asset s estimated useful life 
such lives range from five to twelve years 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 which the company adopted on march   and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which was effective for the company s fiscal years and  the company reviews its intangible assets for possible impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted projected cash flows associated with such assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets 
in those situations  the company recognizes an impairment loss on the intangible asset equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over the asset s fair value  generally determined based upon discounted estimates of future cash flows 
the cost of internally developed software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products for sale are expensed until technological feasibility is established  at which time any additional costs would be capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
technological feasibility of a computer software product is established when the company has completed all planning designing  coding  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
no costs have been capitalized to date for internally developed software products and enhancements as the company s current process for developing software is essentially completed concurrently with the establishment of technological feasibility 
the company capitalizes purchased software upon acquisition when such software is technologically feasible or if it has an alternative future use  such as use of the software in different products or resale of the purchased software 
goodwill the company s goodwill also results from its fiscal purchase of brite voice systems  inc under the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which the company adopted on march   goodwill is presumed to have an indefinite life and is not subject to annual amortization 
goodwill is subjected  however  to tests for impairment on at least an annual basis and more frequently if triggering events are identified on an interim basis 
the impairment review follows the two step approach defined in sfas no 
the first step compares the fair value of the company  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  the company must compare the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the lesser of that excess or the carrying amount of goodwill 
income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized using the liability method and reflect the tax impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
the company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets in circumstances where it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not 
sales the company is a leader in providing converged voice and data solutions for the network and enterprise markets 
the company operates as a single  integrated business unit focusing on these two major markets 
the company s sales to the network market focus on products and services that are designed to create opportunities for network carriers and service providers to increase revenue through value added services and or reduce costs through automation 
sales to the enterprise market focus on providing automated customer service and communications systems that reduce costs and improve customer service levels through enabling accurate and efficient communication and transactions between an enterprise  its customers and its business partners 
in both markets  the company provides a suite of professional services that supports its installed systems including maintenance  implementation  and business and technical consulting services 
to further leverage the strong return on investment offered by its systems offerings  the company also offers enhanced communications solutions to network and enterprise customers on an outsourced basis as an application service provider  or asp 
the company s sales by market for fiscal  and  were as follows in millions enterprise systems sales enterprise services sales enterprise total sales network systems sales network services sales network total sales total company systems sales total company services sales total company sales the company assigns revenues to geographic locations based on the location of the customer 
the company s net sales by geographic area for fiscal years  and were as follows in millions north america central and south america pacific rim europe  middle east and africa total international sales constituted  and of total company sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
effective march   the company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the cumulative effect of this change in accounting has been reflected as a charge to fiscal operations and is discussed below in income loss from operations and net income loss 
as a result of the change  the company recognized as part of fiscal sales million of revenue whose contribution to income is included in the cumulative effect adjustment and did not recognize million of sales whose contribution to income would have been recognized had the change in accounting policy not been adopted 
total company sales declined in fiscal and in fiscal when compared to sales of the preceding year 
the decrease in sales in fiscal was comprised of decreases in systems sales of approximately in both of the company s primary markets and a decline in services sales to the network market  partially offset by a increase in services sales to the enterprise market 
the reduced levels of systems sales continue to reflect the previously reported sharp declines in the company s primary markets over the past two years 
the company believes that its major markets will remain soft through fiscal the decline in services sales to the networks sector is primarily attributable to decreased managed service revenues resulting from a decrease in the volume of activity processed under certain of the company s contacts  including  particularly  its contract with o as further described below 
the increase in services sales to the enterprise sector is attributable to growth in the sale of customer support services and growth in the managed services customers base during the year 
the company anticipates continued growth in its enterprises services business  including particularly its managed services business 
the decrease in sales in fiscal was comprised of decreases in enterprise and network systems sales of and  respectively  an decrease in network services sales and a increase in enterprise services sales 
the decline in system sales reflects the sharp decline in the company s primary markets  particularly the decline in the market for telecommunications equipment and services during the year 
this decline was particularly pronounced in the fourth quarter of when the company s sales declined by from the third quarter of fiscal as in fiscal  the network services decline reflects a reduction in the division s managed services revenues  particularly those attributable to its contract with o as further described below 
the increase in enterprise services was primarily attributable to growth in the sale of service and support contracts 
the impact of foreign currency changes during the year on annual sales for fiscal was not material 
the company has historically made significant sales of systems  customer services and managed services to british telecom and its affiliate bt cellnet together bt 
in november  bt cellnet was separated from the british telecom consolidated group and became o sales to a combination of the bt and o entities accounted for  and of the company s total revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
sales under a single managed services contract with bt cellnet and subsequently with o accounted for  and of the company s total revenues for such years 
monthly minimum managed service revenues under this managed services contract declined during fiscal from a fiscal high of approximately million per month in march to a fixed fee of approximately million per month as of january in accordance with the terms of the customer contract 
beginning in june  in conjunction with a contract amendment that extends the term of the managed services agreement for two years to june  the fixed fee will be further reduced to approximately million per month 
the company expects its cost of providing services under this contract to rise slightly during the extension period 
no other customer accounted for or more of the company s sales during fiscal   or the company uses a system combining estimated sales from its service and support contracts  pipeline of systems sales opportunities  and backlog of committed systems orders to estimate sales and trends in its business 
sales in fiscal from service and support contracts  including contracts for asp managed services  comprised approximately of the company s total sales  up from in fiscal on average  the backlog of systems sales and the pipeline of opportunities for systems sales during the same period have contributed approximately and  respectively 
each contributed approximately of sales during fiscal the company s service and support contracts range in duration from one month to three years  with many longer duration contracts allowing customer cancellation privileges 
it is easier for the company to estimate service and support sales than to measure systems sales for the next quarter because service and support contracts generally span multiple quarters  and revenues recognized under each contract are generally similar from one quarter to the next 
the company s backlog is made up of customer orders for systems for which it has received complete purchase orders and which the company expects to ship within twelve months 
at february   and  the company s backlog of systems sales was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the company s pipeline of opportunities for systems sales is the aggregation of its sales opportunities  with each opportunity evaluated for the date the potential customer will make a purchase decision  competitive risks  and the potential amount of any resulting sale 
no matter how promising a pipeline opportunity may appear  there is no assurance it will ever result in a sale 
while this pipeline may provide the company some sales guidelines in its business planning and budgeting  pipeline estimates are necessarily speculative and may not consistently correlate to revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time 
while the company knows the amount of systems backlog available at the beginning of a quarter  it must speculate on its pipeline of systems opportunities for the quarter 
the company s accuracy in estimating total systems sales for future fiscal quarters is  therefore  highly dependent upon its ability to successfully estimate which pipeline opportunities will close during the quarter 
in fiscal  management implemented an oracle based customer relationship management crm tool to provide the necessary data to allow the company to better  track  manage and forecast its active global sales backlog and pipeline 
in fiscal  the intervoice sales force is performing required weekly forecasting with the crm tool 
the forecasts are expected to provide management and the sales force with the information necessary to effectively direct the company s complex global sales organization and increase sales productivity 
other projected benefits of the automated crm process are enhanced strategy formulation through greater insight into market demand and trends and increased visibility into the company s sales pipeline and backlog 
the company is prone to quarterly sales fluctuations 
some of the company s transactions are completed in the same fiscal quarter as ordered 
the quantity and size of large sales sales valued at approximately million or more during any quarter can cause wide variations in the company s quarterly sales and earnings  as such sales are unevenly distributed throughout the fiscal year 
to compete effectively in its target markets in fiscal and beyond  the company believes it must transition its products and services to an open  standards based business model 
the company has historically provided complete  bundled hardware and software systems using internally developed components to address its customers total business needs 
increasingly  the markets for the company s products are requiring a shift to the development of products and services based on an open  standards based architecture such as the jee and microsoft s r 
net environments utilizing voicexml and or salt standards 
such an open  standards based approach allows customers to independently purchase and combine hardware components  standardized software modules  and customization  installation and integration services from individual vendors deemed to offer the best value in the particular class of product or service 
in such an environment  the company believes it may sell less hardware and fewer bundled systems and may become increasingly dependent on its development and sale of software application packages  customized software and consulting and integration services 
this shift will place new challenges on the company s management to transition its products and to hire and retain the mix of personnel necessary to respond to this business environment  to adapt to the changing expense structure that the new environment may tend to foster  and to increase sales of services  customized software and application packages to offset reduced sales of hardware and bundled systems 
special charges fiscal during fiscal  the company continued to implement actions designed to lower cost and improve operational efficiency in response to continued softness in the primary markets for its products 
it also reviewed its intangible assets for evidence of impairment in light of changes in its business and continued weakness in the world wide telecommunications networks markets 
see amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
the following table summarizes the effect of the special charges on fiscal operations by financial statement category in millions 
impairment cost of research other of goods sold development sg a expenses intangibles total write down of intangible assets severance payments and related benefits facilities closures write down of excess inventories costs associated with loss contracts loss on early extinguishment of debt total the severance and related costs recognized during fiscal relate to three separate workforce reductions that affected a total of employees 
one of the reductions was associated with the company s consolidation of its separate enterprise and networks divisions into a single  integrated organizational structure 
the charge also includes costs associated with the resignation of the networks division president during the first quarter of fiscal costs related to facilities closures include million for the closure of the company s leased facility in chicago  illinois and million associated with the closure of a portion of the company s leased facilities in manchester  united kingdom 
the downsizing of the leased space in manchester followed from the company s decision to consolidate virtually all of its manufacturing operations into its dallas  texas facilities 
the inventory adjustments reflect the company s continued assessment of its inventory levels in light of sales projections  the decision to eliminate the uk manufacturing operation and the consolidation of the business units 
the charges for loss contracts reflect the costs incurred on two contracts which are expected to result in net losses to the company upon completion 
the loss on early extinguishment of debt includes million in non cash charges to write off unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issue costs and million in prepayment premiums 
as of february   approximately of severance and related costs remain unpaid 
unpaid amounts are expected to be paid in full during fiscal fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed a comprehensive review of the positioning of its product lines  including lines brought forward from its merger with brite  reevaluated its physical plant needs  and reviewed its aggregate staffing levels 
based on these reviews  the company took a number of strategic actions designed to lower costs and streamline product offerings 
as a result of these actions  the company incurred special charges of approximately million  including million for the write down of intangible assets and inventories associated with discontinued product lines  million for the write down of excess inventories  million for severance payments and related benefits  million for facilities closures  and million relating to the write down of non productive fixed assets 
the following table summarizes the effect of these special charges on fiscal operations by financial statement category in millions

the million write down of inventories and million charge to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses relate to the company s decision to discontinue sales of certain earlier versions of its payment and messaging systems that run on a different hardware platform than that used by the current versions of those systems 
the additional writedown of inventories totaling approximately million relates to items which the company will continue to use in current sales situations but which  given the slowdown in market demand  it held in excess quantities at year end 
as part of its fiscal initiatives  the company announced plans to forego expansion into existing leased space in allen  texas and to close its jacksonville  florida and wichita  kansas locations 
as a result of these actions  the company recorded charges of approximately million  including approximately million accrued for future lease commitments and approximately million for accelerated depreciation expense arising from a reassessment of the useful lives of certain related property and equipment 
as part of its overall facilities assessment  the company also identified and wrote off approximately million of fixed assets no longer being used by the company 
as of february   approximately million of the accrued lease costs remain unpaid 
the company completed the sale of its wichita  kansas office building on may  the million in gross proceeds was used to pay down amounts outstanding under the company s then outstanding revolving credit facility 
the severance and related costs recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal were associated with two workforce reductions that affected employees 
as of february   approximately million of the total severance and related costs remained unpaid 
unpaid amounts are expected to be paid in full during fiscal fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company changed its organizational structure and eliminated certain product offerings in order to reduce costs and improve the company s focus on its core competencies and products 
as a result of these actions  the company incurred special charges of approximately million  including million for severance and related costs  million for the write off of assets associated with discontinued product lines and million for estimated customer accommodations related to the discontinued product lines 
the following table summarizes the effect of these special charges on fiscal operations by financial statement category in millions 
cost of research and goods sold development sg a total severance payments and related benefits write down of assets associated with discontinued product lines customer accommodations associated with discontinued product lines total the severance and related costs were associated with a workforce adjustment that affected approximately employees and included the resignation of the company s president and chief operating officer 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company determined that it had settled its severance related obligations for less than originally anticipated  and  accordingly  the company reversed the remaining accrual of million  reducing selling  general and administrative expenses 
the million charge to write off assets is primarily attributable to the company s decision to discontinue its agentconnect product line and includes a million charge for the impairment of unamortized purchased software included in other intangible assets associated with this product 
the million charge for estimated customer accommodations is comprised primarily of bad debts and customer settlements associated with the company s decision to discontinue the agentconnect product line 
this charge is reflected in selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  the company reached settlements with its affected customers for amounts that were less than originally anticipated 
as a result  it reversed million of the accrual  reducing selling  general and administrative expenses in the third fiscal quarter 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company realized a gain of million upon the sale of shares of stock of speechworks international  inc acquired through the exercise of a warrant received in connection with a supply agreement between the company and speechworks 
this gain is reflected as other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in prior periods  the warrant had been assigned no value in the company s balance sheets because the warrant and the underlying shares were unregistered securities  and significant uncertainties existed regarding the company s ability to monetize the warrant and the timing of any such monetization 
subsequent event during april  the company reduced its workforce by positions 
the company estimates that it will incur charges of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal in connection with this action  with approximately million  million  and million impacting cost of goods sold  research and development  and sg a expenses  respectively 
the majority of such charges are expected to be paid during the first half of fiscal the company anticipates that operating expenses will be reduced approximately million to million per quarter from fourth quarter fiscal levels once these restructuring activities are completed 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million of sales  million of sales and million of sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  the company incurred special charges to cost of goods sold totaling million of sales  million of sales and million of sales  respectively  as described in the preceding special charges section 
a significant portion of the company s cost of goods sold is comprised of labor costs that are fixed over the near term as opposed to direct material and license royalty costs that vary directly with sales volume 
the decrease in the cost of goods sold percentage relating to other than special charges for fiscal is attributable to actions taken during fiscal and to reduce this fixed component of cost 
the company reduced manufacturing headcount by from ending fiscal levels  consolidated its manufacturing operations in a single location  and consolidated certain customer service and managed service support centers 
the increase in the cost of goods sold percentage relating to other than special charges during fiscal is primarily attributable to the softness in the company s fiscal sales  including  particularly  its fiscal fourth quarter sales 
research and development research and development expenses during fiscal  and were approximately million of sales  million of sales  and million of sales  respectively 
the company incurred special charges of million of sales  million of sales and million of sales in fiscal  and  respectively  as described in special charges above 
recurring research and development expenses included the design of new products and the enhancement of existing products 
the company s research and development spending is focused in four key areas 
first  software tools are being developed to aid in the development  deployment and management of customer applications incorporating speech recognition and text to speech technologies 
next  hardware and software platforms are being developed which interface with telephony networks and an enterprise s internal data network 
such platforms are being developed to operate in traditional enterprise networks as well as newer network environments such as jee and microsoft s 
net 
third  voice browsers based on open standards such as salt and voicexml are being developed 
voice browsers incorporate speech recognition technologies and perform the task of formatting a user s verbal query into an inquiry that can be acted upon and or responded to by an enterprise system 
finally  research and development activities are focusing on modularization of key hardware and software elements 
this is increasingly important in a standards based  open systems architecture as modularization will allow for interchange of commodity elements to reduce overall systems cost and for the company s best of breed and core technology strengths to be leveraged into new applications and vertical markets 
the company expects to maintain a strong commitment to research and development to remain at the forefront of technology development in its business markets  which is essential to the continued improvement of the company s position in the industry 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses totaled million of sales  million of sales  and million of sales  in fiscal  and  respectively 
such amounts included special charges of million of sales  million of sales and million of sales  respectively  as described in special charges above 
sg a expenses have declined in absolute dollars as a result of cost control initiatives implemented by the company and as a result of lower commissions and incentive bonuses being earned on lower sales volumes 
sg a expenses have increased as a percent of the company s total sales because of the decline in sales 
amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets in connection with its purchase of brite in fiscal  the company recorded intangible assets and goodwill totaling million 
these assets were assigned useful lives ranging from to years 
for the fiscal years ended february   and  the company recognized amortization and impairment expense related to these assets as follows in millions amortization of goodwill amortization of other acquisition related intangible assets total amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets impairment of other acquisition related intangible assets as described below impairment of goodwill in connection with the impairment of other acquisition related intangible assets as described below total impairment charged to operating income total amortization and impairment charged to operating income impairment of goodwill in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
as described below effective march   the company adopted statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets the statements 
statement no 
refines the definition of what assets may be considered as separately identified intangible assets apart from goodwill 
statement no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to impairment tests on at least an annual basis 
in adopting the statements  the company first reclassified million of intangible assets associated with its assembled workforce net of related deferred taxes of million to goodwill because such assets did not meet the new criteria for separate identification 
the company then allocated its adjusted goodwill balance of million to its then existing enterprise and networks divisions and completed the transitional impairment tests required by statement no 
the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a combination of the expected present values of future cash flows and an assessment of comparable market values 
as a result of these tests  the company determined that the goodwill associated with its networks division was fully impaired  and  accordingly  it recognized a non cash  goodwill impairment charge of million as the cumulative effect on prior years of this change in accounting principle 
this impairment resulted primarily from the significant decline in networks sales and profitability during the fourth quarter of fiscal and related reduced forecasts for the division s sales and profitability 
effective august   the company combined its divisions into a single integrated organizational structure in order to address changing market demands and global customer requirements 
the company conducted its required annual test of goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of fiscal no additional impairment of goodwill was indicated 
accordingly  at february   the company s remaining acquired goodwill totaled million during fiscal  the company was adversely affected by continuing softness in the general us economy  by extreme softness in the worldwide network telecommunications market and by political tensions in parts of south america and the middle east 
the company experienced a second year of declining network revenue and significantly reduced its estimates of near term growth in revenue and net income for its networks based products 
as a result  the company determined that a triggering event  as defined in sfas no 
 had occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal and  accordingly  the company evaluated its intangible assets for evidence of impairment 
based on the results of its review  the company recognized impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of its customer relations and developed technology intangible assets to their respective fair values  which were based on estimated discounted future cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company performed a comprehensive review of the positioning of all product lines  including lines brought forward from its fiscal merger with brite 
as a result of decisions made during that review  the company performed impairment tests in accordance with its stated policies on the brite tradename and on certain of the developed technology associated with the brite acquisition 
based on these tests  the company recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  to reduce the carrying value of these intangible assets and an additional charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill associated with the impaired assets 
at february   the company had million in net intangible assets other than goodwill which will be subject to amortization in future periods 
the estimated amortization expense attributable to the company s intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter is as follows in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter other income expense other income expense during fiscal and was primarily interest income on cash and cash equivalents 
during fiscal  the company also incurred foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company realized a gain of million from the sale of speechworks international  inc common stock acquired through the exercise of a warrant received in connection with a supply agreement between the company and speechworks 
in prior periods  the warrant had been assigned no value because the warrant and the shares underlying the warrant were unregistered securities  and significant uncertainties existed regarding the company s ability to monetize the warrant and the timing of any such monetization 
interest expense the company incurred interest expense of approximately million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
substantially all of this expense relates to the company s long term borrowings initially obtained in connection with the brite merger and as subsequently refinanced see liquidity and capital resources for a description of the company s long term borrowings 
the reduction in interest expense from fiscal through fiscal is primarily attributable to the lower levels of debt outstanding during and  partially offset in fiscal by additional costs associated with the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts associated with financings undertaken during the year 
borrowings under the credit agreements totaled million  million and million at february   and  respectively 
assuming principal payments in accordance with the company s existing financing agreements and interest rates consistent with current market rates  the company expects its fiscal interest expense to be approximately million from july through october  the company used interest rate swap arrangements to hedge the variability of interest payments on its variable rate credit facilities 
while in effect  the swap arrangements essentially converted the company s outstanding floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis 
of the million total interest expense in fiscal  approximately million was attributable to net settlements under the interest rate swap arrangements 
the company terminated its swap arrangements in october in response to the continued downward movement in interest rates during fiscal and had no derivative contracts in place as of february  and income taxes the company s income tax benefit for fiscal and differs significantly from the federal statutory rate of primarily as a result of benefits recognized in fiscal as a result of a change in us tax law  operating losses and credit carryforwards generated but not benefited  non deductible amortization of goodwill resulting from the merger with brite  and various us tax credits 
on march   united states tax law was amended to allow companies which incurred net operating losses in and to carry such losses back a maximum of five years instead of the maximum of two years previously allowed 
as a result of this change  during the first quarter of fiscal  the company used million of its previously reported net operating loss carryforwards and million of its previously reported tax credit carryforwards and recognized a one time tax benefit of million  of which million was recognized as additional capital associated with previous stock option exercises 
the company s federal income tax returns for fiscal years and are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
the company has tentatively agreed to proposed adjustments from the irs challenging certain positions taken by the company on those returns 
although resolution of the issues is still subject to final review by the joint committee on taxation  it is probable that as a result of these proposed adjustments  the company will lose the ability to carry back approximately million in net operating losses generated in fiscal if this occurs  the company will be required to repay up to million of refunds previously received from the irs plus accrued interest 
the company has recorded a charge for these probable adjustments as part of its net tax provision benefit for fiscal the company expects final resolution of the issue and cash settlement with the irs to occur during the first half of fiscal any net operating losses which ultimately cannot be carried back to prior years under the settlement with the irs may be carried forward to future years 
at february   the company had us net operating loss carryforwards totaling million  including million which will expire in and million which will expire in the company also had million and million in research and development and foreign tax credit carryforwards  respectively  at february  if unused  the r d tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in  and the foreign tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the company has established a valuation allowance of million against its net deferred tax assets  including the carryforwards described above 
the company believes the existence of losses in its us operations and the dependency of its international subsidiaries on continuing us operations prevent it from concluding that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will be realized 
if some or all of such reserved deferred tax assets are ultimately realized  approximately million of the valuation allowance reversal related to stock option deductions will not provide future benefit to income but rather will be credited to additional capital 
in fiscal  the company did not provide a valuation allowance for deferred assets associated with its foreign subsidiaries 
in providing such a reserve during fiscal  the company recognized tax expense totaling million to increase the valuation allowance for net foreign deferred tax assets that existed at february  during fiscal  and as discussed in amortization and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets  the company reduced its deferred tax liabilities by million in connection with the reclassification of its assembled workforce intangible asset to goodwill 
as a result of this transaction  the company increased the valuation allowance associated with its us net deferred tax asset by million 
income loss from operations and net income loss the company generated a loss from operations of million  a loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million and a net loss of million during fiscal its loss from operations and net loss totaled million and million  respectively  in fiscal in fiscal  the company generated operating income of million  income before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million and a net loss of million 
during each of fiscal  and  the company incurred significant special charges as previously described in this item totaling million  million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  the company benefited from a change in the us federal tax law that allowed it to recognize net tax benefits of approximately million 
in fiscal  the company also recognized the previously described non recurring gain of million associated with the company s sale of speechworks international  inc common stock 
the company s losses in fiscal and fiscal are primarily attributable to the significant decline in the company s sales volumes from levels and to the significant restructuring and other special charges incurred by the company in its efforts to adjust its operations to the rapidly changing market for its products 
while the company benefited throughout fiscal and from the cumulative effect of these efforts  its aggregate costs were too high to allow the company to operate profitably in the face of the sharp downturn in sales activity 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on prior years associated with the company s adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal resulted in a charge to income of million 
assuming the accounting change had been applied retroactively by the company to prior periods  pro forma net loss for fiscal and pro forma net income for would have been million and million  respectively 
net loss per common share would have been in  and net income per diluted share would have been in had the company not adopted sfas no 
 the company s net loss for the year ended february  would have been million or per share 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents the company had million in cash and cash equivalents at february   an increase of million over ending fiscal balances 
borrowings under the company s long term credit facilities totaled million at february   a reduction of million from fiscal ending balances 
although it incurred a net loss for fiscal of million  over of this loss was attributable to non cash charges for depreciation and amortization million  the impairment of intangible assets million  and the reduction of certain inventory values million 
in addition  the company aggressively managed its inventory holdings  its extension of credit and its accounts receivable collection efforts during the year 
inventory balances excluding the write down in certain values described above declined significantly during fiscal  generating million of operating cash  and days sales outstanding dsos of accounts receivable were days at february   down from days at february  as a result  despite the net loss  the company generated million in cash from operating activities during fiscal for sales of certain of its more complex  customized systems generally ones with a sales price of  or more  the company recognizes revenue based on a percentage of completion methodology 
unbilled receivables accrued under this methodology totaled million of total net receivables at february  the company expects to bill and collect unbilled receivables as of february  within the next twelve months 
while the company continues to focus on the level of its investment in accounts receivable  it now generates a significant percentage of its sales  particularly sales of enhanced telecommunications services systems  outside the united states 
customers in certain countries are subject to significant economic and political challenges that affect their cash flow  and many customers outside the united states are generally accustomed to vendor financing in the form of extended payment terms 
to remain competitive in markets outside the united states  the company may offer selected customers such payment terms 
in all cases  however  the company only recognizes revenue at such time as its system or service fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in some limited cases  this policy may result in the company recognizing revenue on a cash basis  limiting revenue recognition on certain sales of systems and or services to the actual cash received to date from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied

the company s wholly owned subsidiary  brite voice systems  inc brite has filed a petition in the united states tax court seeking a redetermination of a notice of deficiency issued by the irs to brite 
the amount of the proposed deficiency is million before interest or penalties and relates primarily to a disputed item in brite s august federal income tax return 
the company and the irs have reached a tentative agreement  subject to final review and approval by the joint committee on taxation  which eliminates the proposed deficiency and  in fact  results in the company receiving a small net refund 
the company expects final resolution of this matter to occur during the first half of fiscal the company used million of cash in net investing activities and used million of cash in net financing activities  including the net repayment of debt described above and the payment of million in debt issuance costs associated with various refinancing activities undertaken during the year as further described below

under the amended loan  the company must have at least million in net equity at the end of each of its fiscal quarters beginning with the quarter ending august  in connection with these amendments  the company prepaid million of the original principal amount outstanding under the loan 
the mortgage loan contains cross default provisions with respect to the company s new term loan and revolving credit agreement  such that a default under the credit facility which leads to the acceleration of amounts due under the facility and the enforcement of liens against the mortgaged property also creates a default under the mortgage loan 
new term loan and revolving credit agreement in august  the company entered into a new credit facility agreement with a lender which provided for an amortizing term loan of million and a revolving credit commitment equal to the lesser of million minus the principal outstanding under the term loan and the balance of any letters of credit million maximum at february  or a defined borrowing base comprised primarily of eligible us and us accounts receivable million maximum at february  
the term loan bears interest  payable monthly  at the prime rate plus at february  
principal is due in equal monthly installments of approximately million through july and final payments of approximately million in august proceeds from the term loan were used to retire million of convertible notes outstanding at the time the company entered into the credit facility  to pay million in accrued interest and early termination premiums related to the convertible notes and to provide additional working capital to the company 
any advances under the revolver loan will accrue interest at the prime rate plus a margin of to  or at the london inter bank offering rate plus a margin of to 
the company may request an advance under the revolver loan at any time during the term of the revolver agreement so long as the requested advance does not exceed the then available borrowing base 
the company has not requested an advance under the revolver as of the date of this filing 
the term loan and the revolving credit agreement expire on august  the new credit facility contains terms  conditions and representations that are generally customary for asset based credit facilities  including requirements that the company comply with certain significant financial and operating covenants 
in particular  the company is initially required to have ebitda  as defined in the agreement  in minimum cumulative amounts on a monthly basis through august  while lower amounts are allowed within each fiscal quarter  the company must generate cumulative ebitda of million and million  respectively  for the nine and twelve month periods ending may  and august  thereafter  the company is required to have minimum cumulative ebitda  as defined  of million and million for the month periods ending november  and february   respectively  and million for the month periods ending each fiscal quarter thereafter 
in order for the company to comply with the escalating minimum ebitda requirements in the credit facility  the company will have to continue to increase revenues and or lower expenses in future quarters 
the company is also required to maintain defined levels of actual and projected service revenues and is prohibited from incurring capital expenditures in excess of million for any fiscal year beginning on or after march  except in certain circumstances and with the lender s prior approval 
borrowings under the new credit facility are secured by first liens on virtually all of the company s personal property and by a subordinated lien on the company s dallas headquarters 
the new credit facility contains cross default provisions with respect to the company s mortgage loan  such that an event of default under the mortgage loan which allows the mortgage lender to accelerate the mortgage loan or terminate the agreement creates a default under the credit facility 
as of february   the company was in compliance with all financial and operating covenants 
warrants in connection with a sale of convertible notes during fiscal  which notes were subsequently redeemed in full for cash prior to year end  the company issued warrants to the buyers 
the warrants give the holders the right to purchase from the company  for a period of three years  an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock for per share as of the date of issuance 
under certain circumstances  this purchase may be accomplished through a cashless exercise 
both the number of warrants and the exercise price of the warrants are subject to antidilution adjustments as set forth in the warrants 
if the company is prohibited from issuing warrant shares under the rules of the nasdaq national market  the company must redeem for cash those warrant shares which cannot be issued at a price per warrant share equal to the difference between the weighted average market price of the company s common stock on the date of attempted exercise and the applicable exercise price 
the company s obligations under the warrants remain in force and are unaffected by the redemption of the convertible notes 
costs associated with the refinancings during fiscal  the company incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs  consisting primarily of investment banking and legal fees  to establish the new term loan and revolving credit agreement and the mortgage loan 
such costs were capitalized and are being charged to interest expense over the life of the related debt obligations 
in addition  in connection with the restructuring of its fiscal debt  the company incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs associated with the convertible notes and warrants 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a loss of approximately million on the early extinguishment of the convertible notes

impact of inflation the company does not expect any significant short term impact of inflation on its financial condition 
technological advances should continue to reduce costs in the computer and communications industries 
further  the company presently is not bound by long term fixed price sales contracts 
the absence of such contracts should reduce the company s exposure to inflationary effects

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company invests cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities that generally have maturities of days or less 
the carrying value of these securities approximates market value  and there is no long term interest rate risk associated with this investment 
at february   the company s outstanding long term debt was comprised of the following in millions february  mortgage loan  bearing interest payable monthly at the greater of or the prime rate plus  principal due may  amortizing term loan  principal due in equal monthly installments of approximately million through july with final payments totaling approximately million in august  interest payable monthly  accruing at a rate equal to the prime rate plus at february  the following table provides information about the company s credit agreements that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for the credit agreements  the table presents cash flows for scheduled principal payments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average variable rates are based on rates in effect as of february  fiscal dollars in millions long term debt variable rate us projected weighted average interest rate foreign currency risks the company transacts business in certain foreign currencies including  particularly  the british pound and the euro 
the company s primary software application development  research and development and other administrative activities are conducted from offices in the united states and the united kingdom  and its primary manufacturing operations are conducted in the united states 
virtually all sales arranged through the company s us offices are denominated in us dollars  which is the functional and reporting currency of the us entity 
sales arranged through the company s us subsidiary are denominated in various currencies  including the british pound  the us dollar and the euro  however  the uk subsidiary s functional currency is the british pound 
for the fiscal year ended february   sales originating from the company s uk subsidiary represented approximately of consolidated sales 
as a result of its international operations  the company is subject to exposure from adverse movements in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
the company has not historically used foreign currency options or forward contracts to hedge its currency exposures because of variability in the timing of cash flows associated with its larger contracts where payments are tied to the achievement of project milestones  and it did not have any such hedge instruments in place at february  rather  the company attempts to mitigate its foreign currency risk by transacting business in the functional currency of each of its major subsidiaries  thus creating natural hedges by paying expenses incurred in the local currency in which revenues will be received 
at february   the company had an intercompany balance payable to its uk subsidiary totaling approximately million 
the company considers such intercompany balance to be a long term investment  as defined under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
foreign currency translation  and management has no plans within the foreseeable future to pay amounts owed to its uk subsidiary 
accordingly  foreign exchange fluctuations on the balance are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in the statement of stockholders equity 
as noted above  the company s operating results are exposed to changes in certain exchange rates including  particularly  those between the us dollar  the british pound and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the other currencies  the company s sales are negatively affected upon the translation of uk operating results to the reporting currency 
the effect of these changes on the company s operating profits varies depending on the level of british pound denominated expenses and the uk subsidiary s overall profitability 
for the fiscal year ended february   the result of a hypothetical  uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the british pound and the euro would have been a decrease in sales of approximately million and a reduction in the net loss of approximately million 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales and or operating expenses  changes in exchange rates also could affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the company s sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
