item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained herein 
results of operations the company s business is cyclical and is affected by the same economic factors that affect the remodeling and housing industries in general  including the availability of credit  consumer confidence  changes in interest rates  market demand and general economic conditions 
in addition to external economic factors  the company s results are sensitive to sales and manufacturing volume  competitors pricing  consumer preferences for flooring products  raw material costs and the mix of products sold 
the manufacturing process is capital intensive and requires substantial investment in facilities and equipment 
the cost of operating these facilities generally does not vary in direct proportion to production volume and  consequently  operating results fluctuate disproportionately with changes in sales volume 
during  congoleum experienced a significant increase in the number of asbestos claims against it and exhausted its primary insurance coverage 
while the company had previously purchased over billion in insurance coverage in excess of the primary coverage  approximately of that coverage was placed with carriers that are now insolvent 
furthermore  the solvent carriers that underwrote the balance of the coverage have disputed their coverage obligations for the company s asbestos claims liability 
the company s dispute with its excess insurance carriers is the subject of ongoing coverage litigation 
as such  the company was forced to fund all costs for defense and indemnity related to asbestos claims after its primary coverage had been exhausted 
in light of this situation  the company began exploring various strategic alternatives to deal with the asbestos situation 
on january  the company announced that it had begun preliminary settlement negotiations with attorneys it believes represent the majority of plaintiffs with asbestos claims pending against it  and that upon successful completion of these negotiations  it intends to seek confirmation of a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on march   the company reached an agreement in principle with attorneys representing more than of the known present claimants with asbestos claims pending against congoleum 
the agreement in principle contemplates a chapter reorganization seeking confirmation of a pre packaged plan that would leave non asbestos creditors unimpaired and would resolve all pending and future asbestos claims against the company  its affiliates and its distributors 
approval of such a plan would require the supporting votes of at least of the asbestos claimants with claims against the company who vote on the plan 
resolution of congoleum s asbestos liability through a pre packaged reorganization plan is subject to various other conditions as well  including approval by the bankruptcy court 
the company expects that the plan of reorganization would provide for an assignment of or grant a security interest in certain rights in and proceeds of congoleum s applicable insurance to a trust that would fund the settlement of all pending and future asbestos claims and protect the company from future asbestos related litigation by channeling all asbestos claims to the trust under section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum expects its other creditors would be unimpaired under the plan and would be paid in the ordinary course of business 
the company expects that several months will be needed to negotiate a pre packaged plan of reorganization  at which time it would file for bankruptcy and request court approval of the plan 
congoleum expects it would take another two to six months to confirm the plan and emerge from the process 
in furtherance of the agreement in principle  on april   the company entered into a settlement agreement with various asbestos claimants the claimant agreement  which will result in a global settlement of more than of the known asbestos personal injury claims pending against the company 
as contemplated by the claimant agreement  the company also entered into agreements establishing a pre petition trust the collateral trust to distribute funds in accordance with the terms of the claimant agreement  and granting the collateral trust a security interest in its rights under applicable insurance coverage and payments from insurers for asbestos claims 
based on its pre packaged bankruptcy strategy  the company has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its contribution and costs to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through a plan trust established under section g of the bankruptcy code 
the company recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of to increase its recorded liability to the estimated minimum of million 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher 
for more information regarding the company s asbestos liability and plan for resolving that liability  please refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect future results the company has significant asbestos personal injury liability and funding exposure  and its strategy for resolving this exposure may not be successful for factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s goals for resolving its asbestos liability 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase resulted primarily from strong sales of the durastone product line  which was introduced in august  and improved resilient sheet sales in both the base grade and trade up builder segment  partially offset by lower luxury and contract tile sales 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales  an increase of million 
gross profit margins declined slightly as costs of expanding sales and the product mix impact of increased base grade builder product sales offset improved manufacturing efficiencies and cost reduction programs 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a charge of million  included in selling  general and administrative expenses  to adjust its recorded liability for resolving asbestos related claims against it 
the recorded liability at december  represents the minimum estimated cost that the company will incur to resolve its asbestos related liability through the execution of the company s anticipated plan of reorganization 
actual costs could be significantly higher  and the company will adjust its recorded liability should its estimates change 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   which includes asbestos related costs of million  as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to the asbestos related charge  significant investments in additional displays and samples to support the durastone product line and higher promotional support contributed to the increase 
loss from operations was million for the year ended december   compared to income of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this change was primarily due to the asbestos charge 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to a combination of lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  due to lower capitalized interest in compared to the company recorded a tax provision of thousand on a loss before income taxes and the cumulative effect of accounting change of million in the tax provision includes a benefit from the reduction of thousand for a tax valuation allowance as a result of utilizing certain loss carry forwards that had previously been fully reserved 
this benefit was offset by an additional provision for valuation allowance 
for  the effective tax rate was resulting in a tax benefit of thousand which includes a reduction for a tax valuation allowance of thousand 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
sfas no 
was effective for the company as of january  during the first quarter of  the company performed a transitional impairment test of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
and concluded that there was impairment 
the company compared the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill and it was determined that based on the fair value of the company s assets and liabilities  there should be no goodwill recorded 
accordingly  the company recorded an impairment loss of million during the first quarter of  which has been recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded other comprehensive expense of million relating to the recognition of a minimum pension liability 
the company reduced its assumed long term rate of return on pension plan assets from to and its discount rate from to 
these changes in assumptions will increase reported pension expense in by million when compared to year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease resulted primarily from lower sales of products for the manufactured housing industry and lower sales to the southwest and west coast regions as a result of a distributor transition in that area 
these declines were largely offset by improved sales in the balance of the us and canada resulting primarily from sales of the company s ultima and new durastone product lines 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million in  or of sales  an increase of million or 
gross profit increased primarily due to improved manufacturing efficiencies  reductions in manufacturing overhead costs  and a more profitable mix of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses remained at approximately 
cost reduction initiatives instituted in the first quarter  including a reduction in the workforce  were partly offset by product launch costs for the new durastone product line 
income from operations was million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
of this million improvement  million is attributable to the impact of costs incurred for a distributor transition in the remainder of the improvement is primarily due to the improvements in margins and reductions in selling  general and administrative costs previously discussed 
interest income declined from million in to million in due to a combination of lower average cash equivalent and short term investment balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily due to lower capitalized interest in compared to the effective tax rate for was resulting in a tax benefit of thousand 
the tax benefit includes a reduction of thousand for a tax valuation allowance 
for  the effective tax rate was resulting in a tax benefit of million which includes a reduction for a tax valuation allowance of million 
liquidity and capital resources the company is a defendant in a large number of asbestos related lawsuits and has announced its intent to file a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which are incorporated herein by reference 
these matters will have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  the company paid million in defense and indemnity costs related to asbestos related claims 
in  the company anticipates spending million in fees  expenses  and indemnity contributions to effect its planned reorganization under chapter cash and equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  an increase of million from december  working capital was million at december   down from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to one  compared to to one a year earlier 
the ratio of debt to total capital at december  was 
compared to 
in net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million  up from cash used by operations of million in cash from operations increased from to due to lower inventories  the non recurrence of significant marketing expenditures related to new product introduction and the one time impact of payments made in related to the settlement of distributor termination costs 
capital expenditures in totaled million 
the company is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and million in required contributions to the company s defined benefit pension plans in were million and are expected to be million in in december  the company entered into a new three year revolving credit facility which provides for borrowings up to million 
interest is based on 
above prime  or over libor  as applicable depending on meeting the required covenants 
this financial agreement contains certain covenants which include the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and ebitda if borrowing availability falls below a certain level 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financial agreement must be met in order for the company to borrow from the facility 
borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  the company had borrowing availability of million  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit 
in september  the company and its lender under the revolving credit facility established pursuant to a loan and security agreement the credit agreement amended the credit agreement to revise certain financial and other covenants 
in february  the company and its lender under the credit agreement further amended the credit agreement to revise certain financial and other covenants on terms negotiated to reflect the transactions contemplated by the company s intended global settlement of its asbestos claims liability 
in march  the company and the trustee of the indenture governing the company s senior notes due amended the indenture to expressly provide the company  under the terms of that indenture  with greater flexibility to pursue possible resolutions of its current and future asbestos claims liability  including negotiating a global settlement with current asbestos plaintiffs  and soliciting acceptances of and filing a prepackaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
holders of a majority in aggregate principle amount of the senior notes as of the record date for determining the holders entitled to vote on the proposed amendment consented to the amendment 
collective bargaining agreements with hourly employees at the company s facilities expire in and in the past five years  there have been no strikes by employees at the company  and the company believes that its employee relations are satisfactory 
the company does not anticipate contract expirations in will result in work stoppages  but should work stoppages occur  they could have a material adverse impact on cash flow and results of operations 
in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  the company has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against the company 
among these claims  the company is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in legal proceedings in part i  item and environmental regulation in part i  item 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of the company s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of the company s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
the company has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other noncurrent assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against the company 
the company s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
the company believes these sources will be adequate to fund working capital requirements  debt service payments  planned capital expenditures  and its current estimates for costs to settle and resolve its asbestos liabilities through its planned pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
the company s inability to get such a plan confirmed in a timely manner would have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to fund its operating and investing requirements 
the following table summarizes the company s obligation for future principal payments on its debt and future minimum rental payments on its noncancelable operating leases at december  payments due by period amounts in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt   operating leases      total      critical accounting policies the company has identified a number of its accounting policies that it has determined to be critical 
these critical accounting policies primarily relate to financial statement assertions that are based on the estimates and assumptions of management where the impact of changing those estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
following is a summary of our critical accounting policies 
asbestos liabilities as discussed in notes and of the notes to financial statements  the company is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products and has announced its intent to seek confirmation of a pre packaged plan of reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code as part of its strategy to resolve this liability 
the company s estimated minimum gross liability to cover judgments and or settlements of known asbestos claims is million  not including the cost to defend and litigate these cases  which is substantially in excess of both the total assets of the company as well as the company s previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for both known and unasserted claims 
while the company purchased insurance coverage it believes applies to these claims  some of the insurance carriers are presently insolvent and the remaining solvent insurance carriers have disputed their coverage obligations 
the company believes the ultimate amount of its liability  and the amount of recoverable insurance  will be determined through some combination of negotiation  litigation  and bankruptcy court order  but that these amounts can no longer be reasonably estimated given all the uncertainties that presently exist 
the company expects that insurance will provide the vast majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of the company itself 
the company believes that it does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
as such  the company believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
the company estimates the minimum costs to affect this plan to be million  which it has recorded as a current liability 
the maximum amount of asbestos losses is limited to the going concern or liquidation value of the company  an amount which the company believes is substantially less than the minimum estimated liability for the known claims against it 
the company will update its estimates as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to future events such as the ability to generate future taxable income 
at december   the company has provided a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax assets 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
management has recorded both liabilities and insurance receivables in its financial statements for its estimate of costs and insurance recoveries for future remediation activities 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the extent of cleanup activities to be performed  the methods employed in the cleanup activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and these assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
pension plans and postretirement benefits the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
as permitted by sfas no 
 the company uses a calculated value of the expected return on plan assets which is further described below 
under sfas no 
 the effects of the actual performance of the pension plan s assets and changes in pension liability discount rates on the company s computation of pension income or expense are amortized over future periods 
the most significant element in determining the company s pension income or expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
for  the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in determining pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains or losses million at will ultimately be recognized as future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
the company accounts for its postretirement benefits other than pensions in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on a actuarial basis 
these amounts are projected based on the january  sfas no 
valuation and the year end disclosure assumptions  including a discount rate of and health care cost trend rates of in reducing to an ultimate rate of in pending adoption of accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
was issued 
sfas no 
provides new guidance on the recognition and measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset retirement cost 
it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
this standard will be effective for the company as of january  the company is currently evaluating what impact  if any  adoption will have on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
was issued 
this standard addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities  and is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of fas no 
to have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
in november  fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fasb interpretation no 
was issued 
the accounting recognition provisions of fasb interpretation no 
are effective january  on a prospective basis 
they require that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
under prior accounting principles  a guarantee would not have been recognized as a liability until a loss was probable and reasonably estimable 
the company is currently evaluating what impact  if any  adoption will have on its future financial position or results of operations 
risk factors that may affect future results the company has significant asbestos liability and funding exposure  and its strategy for resolving this exposure may not be successful 
as more fully set forth in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report  the company has significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims 
the company has reached an agreement in principle with attorneys representing more than of the known present claimants with asbestos claims pending against the company 
in furtherance of the agreement in principle  the company entered into a settlement agreement with various asbestos claimants  which will result in a global settlement of more than of the known asbestos personal injury claims pending against the company 
the agreement in principle also contemplates a chapter reorganization seeking confirmation of a pre packaged plan that would leave non asbestos creditors unimpaired and would resolve all pending and future personal injury asbestos claims against the company  its affiliates and its distributors 
confirmation of such a plan will require  among other things  the supporting votes of at least of the company s asbestos claimants who vote on the plan  as well as a determination by the bankruptcy court that the plan has satisfied certain criteria under the bankruptcy code 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in realizing its goals in this regard or in obtaining the necessary votes  consents and approvals or in implementing its desired plan terms 
as a result  any settlement reached by the company with its asbestos plaintiffs or plan of reorganization pursued by the company or confirmed by a bankruptcy court could vary significantly from the description in this report including descriptions incorporated by reference in this report  including the estimated costs and contributions to effect the contemplated plan of reorganization could be significantly greater than currently estimated 
any plan of reorganization pursued by the company will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including bankruptcy court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
some additional factors that could cause actual results to differ from the company s goals for resolving its asbestos liability by pursuing a global settlement of its pending asbestos claims and soliciting consents for and filing a prepackaged plan of reorganization bankruptcy filing include i the future cost and timing of estimated asbestos liabilities and payments and availability of insurance coverage and reimbursement from insurance companies  which underwrote the applicable insurance policies for the company and its controlling shareholder  american biltrite inc  for asbestos related claims and other costs relating to the execution and implementation of any plan of reorganization pursued by the company  ii timely negotiating and entering into settlement agreements on terms it considers satisfactory with a sufficient majority of asbestos claimants iii timely reaching agreement with other creditors  or classes of creditors  that exist or may emerge  iv the company s and its controlling shareholder s  american biltrite inc s  satisfaction of the conditions and obligations under their respective outstanding debt instruments  and amendment of those outstanding debt instruments  as necessary  to permit the contemplated note contribution s in connection with the company s plan of reorganization and to make certain financial covenants in those debt instruments less restrictive  including covenants applicable to the first quarter of  v the response from time to time of the company s and its controlling shareholder s  american biltrite inc s  lenders  customers  suppliers and other constituencies to the ongoing process arising from the company s strategy to settle its asbestos liability  vi timely obtaining sufficient creditor and court approval of any reorganization plan pursued by it and vii compliance with the united states bankruptcy code  including section g 
as a result of the company s significant liability and funding exposure for asbestos claims  there can be no assurance that if it were to incur any unforecasted or unexpected liability or disruption to its business or operations it would be able to withstand that liability or disruption and continue as an operating company 
for further information regarding the company s asbestos liability  insurance coverage and strategy to resolve its asbestos liability  please see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  which are included in this report 
the company may incur substantial liability for environmental  product and general liability claims in addition to asbestos related claims  and its insurance coverage and its likely recoverable insurance proceeds may be substantially less than the liability incurred by the company for these claims 
environmental liabilities 
due to the nature of the company s business and certain of the substances which are or have been used  produced or discharged by the company  the company s operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation  storage  disposal  handling  emission  transportation and discharge into the environment of hazardous substances 
the company has historically expended substantial amounts for compliance with existing environmental laws or regulations  including environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company will continue to be required to expend amounts in the future for costs related to prior activities at its facilities and third party sites  and for ongoing costs to comply with existing environmental laws  such amounts may be substantial 
there is no certainty that these amounts will not have a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations and financial condition because  as a result of environmental requirements becoming increasingly strict  the company is unable to determine the ultimate cost of compliance with environmental laws and enforcement policies 
moreover  in addition to potentially having to pay substantial amounts for compliance  future environmental laws or regulations may require or cause the company to modify or curtail its operations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
product and general liabilities 
in the ordinary course of its business  the company becomes involved in lawsuits  administrative proceedings  product liability claims in addition to asbestos related claims and other matters 
in some of these proceedings  plaintiffs may seek to recover large and sometimes unspecified amounts and the matters may remain unresolved for several years 
these matters could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition if the company is unable to successfully defend against or settle these matters  its insurance coverage is insufficient to satisfy unfavorable judgments or settlements relating to these matters  or the company is unable to collect insurance proceeds relating to these matters 
the company is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers and would be harmed if there were a significant  prolonged disruption in supply or increase in its raw material costs 
the company s business is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers 
the principal raw materials used by the company in its manufacture of sheet and tile flooring are vinyl resins  plasticizers  latex  limestone  stabilizers  cellulose paper fibers  urethane and transfer print paper 
the company purchases most of these raw materials from multiple sources 
although the company has generally not had difficulty in obtaining its requirements for these materials  it has occasionally experienced significant price increases for some of these materials 
the company believes that suitable alternative suppliers are available for substantially all of its raw material requirements 
however  the company does not have readily available alternative sources of supply for specific designs of transfer print paper  which are produced utilizing print cylinders engraved to the company s specifications 
although no loss of this source of supply is anticipated  replacement could take a considerable period of time and interrupt production of some of the company s products 
in an attempt to protect against this risk of loss of supply  the company maintains a raw material inventory and has an ongoing program to develop new sources which will provide continuity of supply for its raw material requirements 
however  there is no certainty that the company s maintenance of its raw material inventory or its ongoing program to develop new sources of supply would be successful in avoiding a material adverse affect on its business  results of operations and financial condition if it were to realize an extended interruption in the supply of its raw materials 
in addition  the company could incur significant increases in the costs of its raw materials 
although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of its raw materials to its customers  the company s ability to do so is  to a large extent  dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase  competitive pressures and market conditions for its products 
there have been in the past  and may be in the future  periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered 
during those periods of time  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company operates in a highly competitive flooring industry and some of its competitors have greater resources and broader distribution channels than the company 
the market for the company s products is highly competitive 
the company encounters competition from three other manufacturers in north america as well as foreign manufacturers 
some of the company s competitors have greater financial and other resources and access to capital than the company 
furthermore  to the extent any of the company s competitors make a filing under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code and emerge from bankruptcy as a continuing operating company that has shed much of its pre filing liabilities  those competitors may have a competitive cost advantage over the company as a result of having shed those liabilities 
in addition  in order to maintain its competitive position  the company may need to make substantial investments in its business  including its product development  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for the company s products and in the loss of the company s market share for its products 
moreover  due to the competitive nature of the company s industry  the company may be commercially restricted from raising or even maintaining the sales prices of its products  which could result in the company incurring significant operating losses if its expenses were to increase or otherwise represent an increased percentage of the company s sales 
the company is subject to general economic conditions and conditions specific to the remodeling and housing industries 
the company is subject to the effects of general economic conditions 
a sustained general economic slowdown could have serious negative consequences for the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the company s business is cyclical and is affected by the economic factors that affect the remodeling and housing industries in general and the manufactured housing industry specifically  including the availability of credit  consumer confidence  changes in interest rates  market demand and general economic conditions 
the company could realize shipment delays  depletion of inventory and increased production costs resulting from unexpected disruptions of operations at any of the company s facilities 
the company s business depends upon its ability to timely manufacture and deliver products that meet the needs of its customers and the end users of the company s products 
if the company were to realize an unexpected  significant and prolonged disruption of its operations at any of its facilities  including disruptions in its manufacturing operations  it could result in shipment delays of its products  depletion of its inventory as a result of reduced production and increased production costs as a result of taking actions in an attempt to cure the disruption or carry on its business while the disruption remains 
any resulting delay  depletion or increased production cost could result in increased costs  lower revenues and damaged customer and product end user relations  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company offers limited warranties on its products which could result in the company incurring significant costs as a result of warranty claims 
the company offers a limited warranty on all of its products against manufacturing defects 
in addition  as a part of its efforts to differentiate mid and high end products through color  design and other attributes  the company offers enhanced warranties with respect to wear  moisture discoloration and other performance characteristics which generally increase with the price of such products 
if the company were to incur a significant number of warranty claims  the resulting warranty costs could be substantial 
the company is heavily dependent upon its distributors to sell the company s products and the loss of a major distributor of the company could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company currently sells its products through approximately distributors providing approximately distribution points in the united states and canada  as well as directly to a limited number of mass market retailers 
the company considers its distribution network very important to maintaining its competitive position 
while most of its distributors have marketed the company s products for many years  replacements are necessary periodically to maintain the strength of the company s distribution network 
although the company has more than one distributor in some of its distribution territories and actively manages its credit exposure to its distributors  the loss of a major distributor could have a materially adverse impact on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company derives a significant percentage of its sales from two of its distributors  lasalle bristol corporation and mohawk industries  inc lasalle bristol corporation serves as the company s distributor in the manufactured housing market  and mohawk industries  inc serves as a retail market distributor of the company 
these two distributors accounted for of the company s net sales for the twelve months ended december  and of the company s net sales for the year ended december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments  but does not consider this risk exposure to be material to its financial condition or results of operations 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short term maturities 
substantially all of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december  consisted of indebtedness with a fixed rate of interest which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates 
under its current policies  the company does not use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices and does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
