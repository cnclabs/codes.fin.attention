item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview cra is a leading economic and business consulting firm that applies advanced analytic techniques and in depth industry knowledge to complex engagements for a broad range of clients 
founded in  we work with businesses  law firms  accounting firms  and governments worldwide in providing a wide range of consulting services 
we are often retained in high stakes matters  such as multibillion dollar mergers and acquisitions  new product introductions  major capital investment decisions  and complex litigation 
we offer two types of services legal and regulatory consulting and business consulting 
we estimate that we derived approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal from business consulting and legal and regulatory consulting  and approximately percent from neuco  a subsidiary of which we own 
neuco develops and markets a family of neural network software tools and complementary application consulting services that are currently focused on electricity generation by utilities 
we derive revenues principally from professional services rendered by our employee consultants 
in most instances  we charge clients on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues in the period when we provide our services 
we charge consultants time at hourly rates  which vary from consultant to consultant depending on a consultant s position  experience  and expertise  and other factors 
we derive a portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts 
revenues from fixed price engagements are recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
we derived percent and percent of our revenues from fixed price engagements in fiscal and  respectively 
outside experts may or may not bill clients directly for their services 
as a result  we generate substantially all of our professional services fees from the work of our own employee consultants 
factors that affect our professional services fees include the number and scope of client engagements  the number of consultants we employ  the consultants billing rates  and the number of hours our consultants work 
in addition to professional service fees  a portion of our revenues represents expenses billed to clients  such as fees for outside experts  travel and other out of pocket expenses  charges for support staff and outside contractors  and other reimbursable expenses 
our costs of services include the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our employee consultants 
our bonus program awards discretionary bonuses based on our revenues and profitability and individual performance 
costs of services also include out of pocket and other expenses that are billed to clients  and the salaries  bonuses  and benefits of support staff whose time is billed directly to clients  such as librarians  editors  and programmers 
our gross profit  which equals revenues less costs of services  is affected by changes in our mix of revenues 
we experience significantly higher gross margins on revenues from professional service fees than on revenues from expenses billed to clients 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  bonuses  and benefits of our administrative and support staff  fees to outside experts for generating new business  office rent  and marketing and other costs 
in june  we invested approximately  for a majority interest in neuco  inc neuco was established by us and an affiliate of commonwealth energy systems as a start up entity to develop and market a family of neural network software tools and complementary application consulting services for electric utilities 
neuco s financial statements are consolidated with our financial statements 
neuco earned revenues of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal neuco sustained a net loss of approximately  in fiscal  generated a net profit of approximately  in fiscal  and a net loss of approximately million in fiscal there are no assurances of neuco s performance in the future 
on may   in a series of transactions that resulted in an infusion of new equity in neuco  our ownership interest in neuco was reduced to percent and has subsequently been reduced to percent 
we continue to exercise effective control of neuco  and accordingly  we consolidate their operations 
the transactions were accounted for as increases in minority interest and common stock 
the portion of neuco s income or loss allocable to its other owners is shown as minority interest in our consolidated statements of income  and that amount  together with the capital contributions to neuco of its other owners  is shown as 
table of contents minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
all significant intercompany accounts have been eliminated 
before may   we owned percent of neuco 
on october   we acquired the consulting business of dr 
gordon c 
rausser for million in cash 
the acquisition price may increase based upon the business meeting specified performance targets over the ensuing three fiscal years 
in addition  we loaned dr 
rausser million  on a full recourse basis  for the purchase of our common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method  and the results have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
on july   we acquired certain assets from pa consulting group  inc for million in notes 
the acquisition has been accounted for under purchase accounting  and the results of operations have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the date of acquisition 
on may   we completed the acquisition of certain assets of the north american and uk operations of arthur d 
little  inc s chemical and energy practice adl for million in cash 
the acquisition has been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the effective date of the acquisition of the north american portion was april   while the effective date of the uk portion of the acquisition was may  the results of operations related to the acquisitions have been included in the accompanying statements of operations from the respective effective dates 
we believe that the adl acquisition enhances our existing position in consulting to the chemical and petroleum industries 
we acquired employee consultants  accounts receivable and the ongoing client projects being handled by the acquired employee consultants 
of the million purchase price  million was recorded as intangibles  consisting primarily of customer relationships  million was recorded primarily as accounts receivable  and the remaining million was recorded as goodwill  all of which is expected to be deducted for tax purposes 
the portion of the purchase price attributable to goodwill primarily related to the extensive industry experience of the acquired employee consultants 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which revised the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
specifically  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization  but are monitored annually for impairment  or more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment 
any impairment will be measured based upon the fair value of the related asset based upon the provisions of sfas no 
the company elected early adoption of this accounting standard in fiscal in fiscal  our international operations continued to expand 
in fiscal  our uk operations grew substantially  primarily as a result of the acquisition from adl 
in addition  we opened new offices in brussels  belgium  and dubai  united arab emirates  in fiscal revenues from our international operations accounted for and of our total revenues in fiscal and  respectively  as more fully described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our fiscal year ends on the last saturday in november  and accordingly  our fiscal year will periodically contain weeks rather than weeks 
in particular  fiscal contained weeks 
this additional week of operations in the fiscal year will affect the comparability of results of operations of this fiscal year with other fiscal years 
historically  we have managed our business based on a four week billing cycle to clients and  consequently  have established quarters that are divisible by four week periods 
as a result  the first  second  and fourth quarters of each fiscal year are week periods  and the third quarter of each fiscal year is a week period 
however  the fourth quarter in fiscal is weeks long 
accordingly  period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful if the periods being compared have different lengths 
the additional week in fiscal resulted in million of revenue and was not material to results of operations 
the terms fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal refer to the week periods ended november   november   november   november   and the week period ended november   respectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to understanding and evaluating our financial results is set forth below 
this summary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the performance of professional services 
the contracts that we enter into and operate under specify whether the engagement will be billed on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
typically  these engagements are of a short  predetermined time frame  generally lasting three to six months  although some of our engagements can be much longer in duration 
a vice president of cra approves all contracts 
we recognize all of our revenue under written service contracts with our clients 
revenues from time and materials service contracts are recognized as the services are provided 
revenues from fixed price engagements are recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
project costs are based on the direct salary and associated fringe benefits of the consultants on the engagement plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement that are not reimbursed by the client 
the percentage of completion method is used since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made  based on historical experience and milestones set in the contract 
our financial management maintains contact with project managers to discuss the status of the projects and  for fixed price engagements  financial management is updated on the budgeted costs and required resources to complete the project 
these budgets are then used to calculate revenue recognition and to estimate the anticipated income or loss on the project 
in the past  we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which have resulted in lower than anticipated profitability or losses on those contracts 
we may experience similar situations in the future 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
to date  such losses have not been significant 
revenues also include expenses billed to clients  which include travel and other out of pocket expenses  charges for support staff and outside contractors  and other reimbursable expenses 
these expenses included in revenue in fiscal  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we recognize revenue for services only in those situations where collection from the client is reasonably assured 
our normal payment terms are days from invoice date 
for fiscal and fiscal  our average days sales outstanding for billed and unbilled accounts receivable was days and days  respectively 
our project managers and finance personnel monitor timely payments from our clients and assess any collection issues 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policy and relationship of our accounts receivable and revenues 
in determining these estimates  we examine historical write offs of our receivables and review each client s account to identify any specific customer collection issues 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
our failure to estimate accurately the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
as of november  and november   million and million  respectively  were provided for doubtful accounts 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for our acquisitions of consolidated companies under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to sfas no 
 business combinations 
intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their expected useful lives 
intangible assets consist mainly of noncompetition agreements and customer relationships and are generally amortized over three to ten years 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets  of acquired businesses that are consolidated 
in accordance with sfas no 
 which we adopted in fiscal  we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an impairment review of our goodwill annually  or more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment 
as a result of our annual review  we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill as of november  if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
the net amount of goodwill was approximately million as of november  we assess the impairment of amortizable intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we would review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the net amount of intangible assets was approximately million as of november  accounting for income taxes 
we record income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
our financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
the decision to record a valuation allowance requires varying degrees of judgment based upon the nature of the item giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
as a result of operating losses incurred in certain of our foreign subsidiaries  anticipated additional operating losses in the future and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we recorded a full valuation allowance in certain of these foreign subsidiaries during the year ended november  had we not recorded this allowance  we would have reported a lower effective tax rate than that recognized in our statements of income 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  future expansion into areas with varying country  state  and local income tax rates  deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction and as a result of acquisitions 

table of contents results of operations the following table provides operating information as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended november  november  november  weeks weeks revenues costs of services gross profit selling  general and administrative special charge income from operations interest income  net income before provision for income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes income before minority interest minority interest net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million  or percent  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of employee consultants  particularly as a result of the business acquired from adl  increased billing rates for our consultants  and to a lesser extent  an additional week of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  offset in part by a decrease in utilization and a decrease in neuco revenue 
utilization was percent for fiscal as compared to percent for fiscal average utilization decreased in fiscal in part because of the acquisition from adl  and otherwise would have averaged percent for the year 
the total number of employee consultants increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal we experienced significant revenue increases during fiscal primarily in our chemicals and petroleum  finance  and electric utility practice areas 
costs of services 
costs of services increased by million  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an increase in the number of employee consultants  particularly those acquired from adl  and to a lesser extent  an overall increase in salaries and bonuses paid to our employee consultants 
as a percentage of revenues  costs of services increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to lower utilization of our employee consultants  particularly as a result of the business acquired from adl  where the related employee consultants were not immediately utilized to the same extent as our other employees 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the primary contributors to the decrease as a percentage of revenues were a decrease in amortization of goodwill resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
and a decrease in commission payments to outside experts 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in overall compensation for administrative staff and rent expense 

table of contents interest and other income  net 
net interest income decreased by  or percent  from million in fiscal to  in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from the overall decline in short term interest rates during fiscal and an increase in interest expense related to notes payable 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes increased by  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate was unchanged at percent in fiscal and fiscal although our effective tax rate was unchanged  neuco s net losses  some of which neuco cannot receive a current tax benefit  were offset by the use of certain net operating losses in mexico that were previously fully reserved 
minority interest 
minority interest in the results of operations of neuco decreased from a gain of  in fiscal to a loss of  in fiscal due to a change from profit at neuco in fiscal to a loss in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal revenues 
revenues increased million  or percent  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in revenues was due primarily to an increase in the number of employee consultants  an increase in consulting services performed for new and existing clients during the period  and to a lesser extent  increased billing rates for our consultants 
utilization was percent for fiscal as compared to percent for fiscal the total number of employee consultants increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal we experienced revenue increases during fiscal in both our legal and regulatory consulting services and business consulting services and  in particular  generated significant revenue increases in our competition and electric utility practice areas 
costs of services 
costs of services increased by million  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  costs of services increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenues was due primarily to an overall increase in salary and bonus paid to our more senior employee consultants and a shift in our employee base toward a larger percentage of these more highly compensated employee consultants 
selling  general  and administrative 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal contributing to the increase were commission payments to outside experts  an increase in administrative staff  rents and other expenses for additional office space including foreign offices in london  melbourne and wellington  an increase in indirect travel costs  and amortization costs related to an acquired business 
special charge 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we relocated our london and washington offices and recorded a special charge of  which consisted primarily of duplicate rent and the remaining lease obligations for the former space of these offices 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased by  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease resulted primarily from the overall decline in short term interest rates during fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased by  or percent  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our effective tax rate increased slightly from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal primarily due to foreign net operating losses not currently benefited 
minority interest 
minority interest in the results of operations of neuco increased from a loss of  in fiscal to a profit of  in fiscal due to an increase in revenue and profit in neuco 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as of november   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  long term investments of million  and working capital of million 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million 
cash generated from operating activities resulted primarily from net income of million and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of million and an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  consisting principally of million used to purchase certain assets of the north american and uk operations of adl and million used to purchase property and equipment 
net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  consisting principally of payments on notes payable in connection with the acquisition of pa consulting group  inc and offset in part by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
the notes were payable on a quarterly basis through december  in connection with our acquisition of the consulting business of dr 
rausser  we loaned dr 
rausser million  which he used to purchase shares of our common stock 
the loan is scheduled to be repaid in if the acquired business meets specified performance targets  we will owe dr 
rausser additional consideration  payable in the first quarter of fiscal we currently have available a million revolving line of credit with our bank  which is secured by our accounts receivable 
this line of credit automatically renews each year on june unless earlier terminated by either our bank or us 
no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit as of november  we believe that current cash balances  cash generated from operations and credit available under our bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results 
there can be no assurance  however  that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
factors affecting future performance we depend upon only a few key employees to generate revenue our business consists primarily of the delivery of professional services  and accordingly  our success depends heavily on the efforts  abilities  business generation capabilities  and project execution of our employee consultants 
if we lose the services of any employee consultant or if our employee consultants fail to generate business or otherwise fail to perform effectively  that loss or failure could harm our business 
our employee consultants generated engagements that accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal and percent in fiscal our top five employee consultants generated approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal and percent in fiscal we do not have any employment agreements with our employee consultants  and they can terminate their relationships with us at will and without notice 
the noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements that we have with many of our employee consultants offer us only limited protection and may not be enforceable in every jurisdiction 
our failure to manage our expanding business successfully could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations any failure on our part to manage our expanding business successfully could harm our business 
we have continued to open new offices in new geographic areas  including foreign locations  and to expand our employee base as a result of both internal growth and acquisitions 
operations in our foreign offices are subject to foreign currency fluctuations and cultural differences that could affect utilization 
opening and managing new offices requires extensive management supervision and tends to increase our overall selling  general and administrative expenses 
expansion creates new and increased management  consulting  and training responsi 
table of contents bilities for our employee consultants 
expansion also increases the demands on our internal systems  procedures  and controls  and on our managerial  administrative  financial  marketing and other resources 
we depend heavily upon the managerial  operational  and administrative skills of our officers  particularly james c 
burrows  our president and chief executive officer  to manage our expansion 
new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect the overall quality of our work 
our entry into new lines of business could adversely affect our results of operations if we attempt to develop new practice areas or lines of business outside our core economic and business consulting services  those efforts could harm our results of operations 
our efforts in new practice areas or new lines of business involve inherent risks  including risks associated with inexperience and competition from mature participants in the markets we enter 
our inexperience may result in costly decisions that could harm our business 
for example  neuco was not profitable in three of the last four fiscal years  which harmed our results of operations in those years 
there are no assurances of neuco s performance in the future 
clients can terminate engagements with us at any time many of our engagements depend upon disputes  proceedings  or transactions that involve our clients 
our clients may decide at any time to seek to resolve the dispute or proceeding  or abandon the transaction 
our engagements can therefore terminate suddenly and without advance notice to us 
if an engagement is terminated unexpectedly  the employee consultants working on the engagement could be underutilized until we assign them to other projects 
accordingly  the termination or significant reduction in the scope of a single large engagement could harm our business 
we depend on our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions consulting business we derived approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal and  and percent in fiscal  from engagements in our antitrust and mergers and acquisitions practice areas 
any substantial reduction in the number or size of our engagements in these practice areas could harm our business 
we derived the great majority of these revenues from engagements relating to enforcement of united states antitrust laws 
changes in federal antitrust laws  changes in judicial interpretations of these laws  or less vigorous enforcement of these laws as a result of changes in political appointments or priorities or for other reasons could substantially reduce our revenues from engagements in this area 
in addition  adverse changes in general economic conditions  particularly conditions influencing the merger and acquisition activity of larger companies  could also adversely affect engagements in which we assist clients in proceedings before the us department of justice and the us federal trade commission 
the continuing economic slowdown is adversely affecting mergers and acquisitions activity  which is reducing the number and scope of our engagements in this practice area 
any continuation or worsening of the downturn could cause this trend to intensify  which would adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
we derive our revenues from a limited number of large engagements we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of large engagements 
if we do not obtain a significant number of new large engagements each year  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could suffer 
our largest engagements accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal and percent in fiscal and our largest clients accounted for approximately percent  percent  and percent of our revenues in those years  respectively 
in general  the volume of work we perform for any particular client varies from year to year  and a major client in one year may not hire us again 
we enter into fixed price engagements we derive a portion of our revenues from fixed price contracts 
if we fail to estimate accurately the resources required for a fixed price project or fail to satisfy our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project budget  then we might generate a smaller profit or incur a loss on the project 
we have 
table of contents occasionally had to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  and we may have to take similar action in the future  which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
our business could suffer if we are unable to hire additional qualified consultants as employees our business continually requires us to hire highly qualified  highly educated consultants as employees 
our failure to recruit and retain a significant number of qualified employee consultants could harm our business 
relatively few potential employees meet our hiring criteria  and we face significant competition for these employees from our direct competitors  academic institutions  government agencies  research firms  investment banking firms  and other enterprises 
many of these competing employers are able to offer potential employees significantly greater compensation and benefits or more attractive lifestyle choices  career paths  or geographic locations than we can 
competition for these employee consultants has increased our labor costs  and a continuation of this trend could have a material adverse effect on our margins and results of operations 
we depend on our outside experts we depend on our relationships with our exclusive outside experts 
in fiscal and fiscal  six of our exclusive outside experts generated engagements that accounted for approximately percent and percent of our revenues in those years 
we believe that these outside experts are highly regarded in their fields and that each offers a combination of knowledge  experience  and expertise that would be very difficult to replace 
we also believe that we have been able to secure some engagements and attract consultants in part because we could offer the services of these outside experts 
most of these outside experts can limit their relationships with us at any time for any reason 
these reasons could include affiliations with universities with policies that prohibit accepting specified engagements  the pursuit of other interests  and retirement 
thirty of our outside experts have entered noncompetition agreements with us as of november  the limitation or termination of any of their relationships with us or competition from any of them after these agreements expire could harm our business 
to meet our long term growth targets  we need to establish ongoing relationships with additional outside experts who have reputations as leading experts in their fields 
we may be unable to establish relationships with any additional outside experts 
in addition  any relationship that we do establish may not help us meet our objectives or generate the revenues or earnings that we anticipate 
acquisitions may disrupt our operations or adversely affect our results we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other businesses 
the expenses we incur evaluating and pursuing acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we acquire a business  we may be unable to manage it profitably or successfully integrate its operations with our own 
moreover  we may be unable to achieve the financial  operational  and other benefits we anticipate from any acquisition 
competition for future acquisition opportunities in our markets could increase the price we pay for businesses we acquire and could reduce the number of potential acquisition targets 
further  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks  such as one time charges related to any potential acquisition from which we may withdraw diversion of our management s time  attention  and resources decreased utilization during the integration process loss of key acquired personnel increased costs to improve or coordinate managerial  operational  financial  and administrative systems dilutive issuances of equity securities the assumption of legal liabilities 
table of contents amortization of acquired intangible assets potential write offs related to the impairment of acquired goodwill difficulties in integrating diverse corporate cultures additional conflicts of interests the occurrence of any of these events could harm our business 
our international operations create special risks we may continue our international expansion  and our international revenues may account for an increasing portion of our revenues in the future 
our international operations carry special risks  including greater difficulties in managing and staffing foreign operations cultural differences that adversely affect utilization currency fluctuations that adversely affect our financial position and operating results unexpected changes in trading policies  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable longer sales cycles restrictions on the repatriation of earnings potentially adverse tax consequences  such as trapped foreign losses less stable political and economic environments as a result of the acquisition from adl  we conduct a significant portion of our business in the middle east 
in light of the significant political instability in the region and the substantial potential for an outbreak of hostilities  we may not be able to continue to conduct business in that region without interruption  which could negatively affect our revenues and results of operations 
if our international revenues increase relative to our total revenue  these factors could have a more pronounced effect on our operating results 
in any event  any of these factors could seriously harm our business 
fluctuations in our quarterly revenues and results of operations could depress the market price of our common stock we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenues and results of operations from one quarter to the next 
if our revenues or net income in a quarter fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock could fall significantly 
our results of operations in any quarter can fluctuate for many reasons  including the following the number of weeks in the quarter the number  scope  and timing of ongoing client engagements the extent to which we can reassign employee consultants efficiently from one engagement to the next employee hiring the extent of discounting or cost overruns fluctuations in revenues and results of operations of our subsidiary  neuco severe weather conditions and other factors affecting employee productivity collectibility of receivables 
table of contents because we generate the majority of our revenues from consulting services that we provide on an hourly fee basis  our revenues in any period are directly related to the number of our employee consultants  their billing rates  and the number of billable hours they work in that period 
we have a limited ability to increase any of these factors in the short term 
accordingly  if we underutilize our consultants during one part of a fiscal period  we may be unable to compensate by augmenting revenues during another part of that period 
in addition  we are occasionally unable to utilize fully any additional consultants that we hire  particularly in the quarter in which we hire them 
moreover  a significant majority of our operating expenses  primarily office rent and salaries  are fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues fail to meet our projections in any quarter  that could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our net income 
for these reasons  we believe our historical results of operations do not necessarily predict our future performance 
potential conflicts of interests may preclude us from accepting some engagements we provide our services primarily in connection with significant or complex transactions  disputes  or other matters that are usually adversarial or that involve sensitive client information 
our engagement by a client may preclude us from accepting engagements with the client s competitors or adversaries because of conflicts between their interests or positions on disputed issues or other reasons 
accordingly  the number of both potential clients and potential engagements is limited 
moreover  in many industries in which we provide consulting services  particularly in the telecommunications industry  there has been a continuing trend toward business consolidations and strategic alliances 
these consolidations and alliances reduce the number of potential clients for our services and increase the chances that we will be unable to continue some of our ongoing engagements or accept new engagements as a result of conflicts of interests 
any of these events could harm our business 
maintaining our professional reputation is crucial to our future success our ability to secure new engagements and hire qualified consultants as employees depends heavily on our overall reputation as well as the individual reputations of our consultants and principal outside experts 
because we obtain a majority of our new engagements from existing clients or from referrals by those clients  any client that is dissatisfied with our performance on a single matter could seriously impair our ability to secure new engagements 
any factor that diminishes our reputation or the reputations of any of our personnel or outside experts could make it substantially more difficult for us to compete successfully for both new engagements and qualified consultants 
any loss of reputation could harm our business 
intense competition from other economic and business consulting firms could hurt our business the market for economic and business consulting services is intensely competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
we may be unable to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with any new competitors 
in general  there are few barriers to entry into our markets  and we expect to face additional competition from new entrants into the economic and business consulting industries 
in the legal and regulatory consulting market  we compete primarily with other economic consulting firms and individual academics 
in the business consulting market  we compete primarily with other business and management consulting firms  specialized or industry specific consulting firms  the consulting practices of large accounting firms  and the internal professional resources of existing and potential clients 
many of our competitors have national and international reputations as well as significantly greater personnel  financial  managerial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
some of our competitors also have a significantly broader geographic presence than we do

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk as of november   we were exposed to market risks  which primarily include changes in us interest rates 
we maintain a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of one year or less and a portion of our investments in financial instruments with purchased maturities of two years or less 
these financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because these financial instruments are readily marketable  an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial position
