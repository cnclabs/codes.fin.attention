overview we are a self administered and self managed equity reit that began operations through a predecessor in since the company s initial public offering in  we have evolved into one of the largest owners and operators of suburban office  industrial and retail properties in the southeastern and midwestern united states 
at december   we owned in service office  industrial and retail properties  encompassing approximately million rentable square feet and apartment units  owned an interest or less in in service office and industrial properties  encompassing approximately million rentable square feet and apartment units  owned  acres of undeveloped land suitable for future development  and 
table of contents were developing an additional five properties  which will encompass approximately  rentable square feet including one property encompassing  rentable square feet that we are developing with a joint venture partner 
the following summarizes our capital recycling program during the past three years ending december  office  industrial and retail properties rentable square feet in thousands dispositions contributions to joint ventures developments placed in service redevelopment acquisitions net change apartment properties in units dispositions in addition to the above capital recycling activity  we repurchased million  million and million of common stock and common units during  and  respectively  and million of preferred stock during this represents aggregate repurchases of million of common stock  common units and preferred stock since january  the company conducts substantially all of its activities through  and substantially all of its interests in the properties are held directly or indirectly by  the operating partnership 
the company is the sole general partner of the operating partnership 
at december   the company owned of the common units in the operating partnership 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and the operating partnership and their majority controlled affiliates 
for a discussion of our accounting policies with respect to our investments in unconsolidated affiliates  see investments in joint ventures 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  however  certain of our significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
management has reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the company s independent auditors 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following impairment of long lived assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized costs  fair value of derivative instruments  
table of contents rental revenue  and investments in joint ventures 
impairment of long lived assets 
real estate and leasehold improvements are classified as long lived assets held for sale or as long lived assets to be held and used 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we record assets held for sale at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the impairment loss is the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered from their undiscounted future operating cash flows and we recognize an impairment loss to the extent we believe the carrying amount is not recoverable 
our estimates of the undiscounted future operating cash flows expected to be generated are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and costs to operate each property 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter our assumptions  the undiscounted future operating cash flows estimated by us in our impairment analyses may not be achieved and we may be required to recognize future impairment losses on our properties 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating cost recoveries due from tenants as well as accrued rental rate increases to be received over the life of the existing leases 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as the credit quality of our tenants  delinquent payments  historical trends and current economic conditions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if our assumptions regarding the collectibility of accounts receivables prove incorrect  we could experience write offs of accounts receivable or accrued straight line rents receivable in excess of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
capitalized costs 
expenditures directly related to both the development of real estate assets and the leasing of properties are included in net real estate assets and are stated at cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
the development expenditures include pre construction costs essential to the development of properties  development and construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and other costs incurred during the period of development 
the leasing expenditures include all general and administrative costs  including salaries incurred in connection with successfully securing leases on the properties 
estimated costs related to unsuccessful leases are expensed as incurred 
if our assumptions regarding the successful efforts of development and leasing are incorrect  the resulting adjustments could impact earnings 
fair value of derivative instruments 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
we limit our exposure by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives 
to mitigate our exposure to unexpected changes in interest rates  derivatives are used primarily to hedge against rate movements on our related debt 
we are required to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and to measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in fair value will affect either stockholders equity or net income depending on whether the derivative instrument qualifies as a hedge for accounting purposes 
to determine the fair value of derivative instruments  we use a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date 
for the majority of financial instruments  including most derivatives  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing modes  replacement cost and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 
rental revenue 
rental revenue is comprised of base rent  recoveries from tenants which represent reimbursements for certain costs as provided in the lease agreements such as real estate taxes  utilities  insurance  common area maintenance and other recoverable costs  parking and other income and termination fees which relate to specific tenants  each of whom has paid a fee to terminate its lease obligation before the end of the contracted term on the lease 

table of contents in accordance with gaap  base rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
this means that  with respect to a particular lease  actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may be higher or lower than the amount of rental revenue recognized for the period 
accrued straight line rents receivable represents the amount by which straight line rental revenue exceeds rents currently billed in accordance with lease agreements 
investments in joint ventures 
as of december   our investments in unconsolidated affiliates consist of one corporation  nine limited liability companies  five limited partnerships and two general partnerships 
we account for our investments in unconsolidated affiliates under the equity method of accounting as we exercise significant influence  but do not control these entities 
our unconsolidated corporation is controlled by an unrelated third party that owns more than of the outstanding voting stock 
we have a or less ownership interest in the unconsolidated limited liability companies and  under the terms of the various operating agreements  do not have any participating rights 
we have a or less ownership interest in the unconsolidated limited partnerships and general partnerships 
although we have an interest in two unconsolidated general partnerships and are the general partner in three of the unconsolidated limited partnerships  under the terms of the various partnership agreements  we do not have control of the major operating and financial policies of these unconsolidated partnerships 
these investments are initially recorded at cost  as investments in unconsolidated affiliates  and are subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates over the life of the property  which is generally years 
from time to time  we contribute real estate assets to an unconsolidated joint venture in exchange for a combination of cash and an equity interest in the venture 
we record a partial gain on the contribution of the real estate assets to the extent of the third party investor s interest and record a deferred gain to the extent of our continuing interest in the unconsolidated joint venture 

table of contents results of operations on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  sfas 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we reclassified the operations and or gain loss from disposal of certain properties to discontinued operations if the properties were either sold during or were held for sale at december  and met certain conditions as stipulated by sfas accordingly  the operations and gain loss from those properties disposed of during and were not reclassified to discontinued operations

table of contents comparison of to rental revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average occupancy rates from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the average occupancy decreased mainly due to tenant rollover and early lease terminations at various properties where vacant space was not re leased due to the lack of demand for office space coupled with an increasing supply of competitive space 
during the past twelve months  approximately million square feet of development properties were placed in service which have leased up slower than expected and as a result  have also adversely affected the occupancy of our overall portfolio 
rental revenue also decreased due to the impact of dispositions during and that were not classified as discontinued operations as more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as a result of the bankruptcy of worldcom and its affiliates  we wrote off approximately million of accrued straight line rent receivable against revenue and since july   we have recorded rental revenue relating to worldcom and its affiliates on a cash basis rather than on a straight line basis 
same property rental revenue  recorded in accordance with gaap  generated from the million square feet of wholly owned in service properties on january   decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease is primarily a result of lower same store average occupancy  which decreased from in to in  and a decrease in straight line rental income primarily as a result of the bankruptcy of worldcom and its affiliates 
during the year ended december   second generation leases representing million square feet of office  industrial and retail space were executed at an average rate per square foot which was lower than the average rate per square foot on the expired leases

depreciation and amortization from continuing operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the increase of million  or  was due to an increase in amortization related to leasing commissions and tenant improvement expenditures for properties placed in service during and and the write off of million of deferred leasing costs primarily related to the leases rejected by worldcom at december   see known trends affecting results of operations 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation for properties disposed of during and that are not classified as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas interest expense from continuing operations increased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the decrease in capitalized interest for the years ended december  and  which was million and million  respectively 
partly offsetting this increase was a decrease in weighted average interest rates from in to in the average outstanding debt balance remained relatively consistent for and interest expense for the years ended december  and included million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred financing costs and costs related to our interest rate hedge contracts 

table of contents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total rental revenue which includes rental revenue for discontinued operations  interest and other income  and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates was in and in included in general and administrative expenses in was a nonrecurring compensation of million which was related to the exercise of options during when an option holder elected to exercise options  in lieu of issuing new shares upon exercise of the option and then repurchasing shares on the open market  we settled the option exercise by paying the option holder the net difference in cash between the strike price and the market value of the underlying shares 
such exercises were recorded as compensation expense under fasb interpretation no 
accounting for certain transactions involving stock options  an interpretation of apb opinion no 

had we issued the shares to the option holder  received the cash for the strike price and then repurchased the shares in the market  we would not have been required to record any compensation expense 
during  we discontinued the practice of settling option exercises by paying the option holder the net difference in cash between the strike price and the market value of the underlying shares 
in the event we decide to repurchase shares after an option exercise  we will require the option holder to pay the cash for the strike price and then separately repurchase a corresponding number of shares in the market under our stock repurchase program 
we reserved million in the year ended december  for probable and estimated losses related to various legal proceedings from previously completed mergers and acquisitions 
interest and other income from continuing operations decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease primarily resulted from a decrease in leasing and development fee income in the year ended december  and a decrease in interest income in the year ended december  due to the collection of notes receivable during and equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates decreased  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily a result of lower lease termination fees and lower property operating expense reimbursements in the decrease in earnings was partly offset by lower interest expense incurred during as a result of lower weighted average borrowing rates and earnings from certain joint ventures formed with unrelated investors during gain on disposition of land and depreciable assets decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in  the majority of the gain was comprised of a gain related to the disposition of  apartment units and a gain related to the disposition of acres of land 
in  the majority of the gain was comprised of a gain related to the disposition of  square feet of office properties  that did not meet certain conditions to be classified as discontinued operations as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and a gain related to the disposition of acres of land 
the gain is partly offset by an impairment loss of approximately million recorded in related to a property that will be partially demolished and redeveloped into a class a suburban office property 
in accordance with sfas  we classified net income of million and million  net of minority interest  as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  respectively  which pertained to million square feet of property sold in and million square feet of property held for sale at december  we also classified as discontinued operations in the gain on the sale of these properties of million  net of minority interest  partly offset by an impairment charge of  net of minority interest  related to one property held for sale at december  in addition  in accordance with sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  we have deferred the recognition of additional gain of million  million net of minority interest  relating to the disposition of  square feet to a third party buyer during the fourth quarter of for which we have guaranteed the buyer up to million of rental shortfalls or re tenanting costs

same property rental revenue generated from the million square feet of the in service properties wholly owned on january   increased million  or  for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of scheduled increases in rental rates on existing leases  an overall increase in rental rates on new leases and rollovers and an increase in recoveries from tenants

the decrease resulted from the company s million repurchase of its preferred stock during known trends affecting results of operations we expect our net income and funds from operations to be lower in than in due to the following factors lower average occupancy  lower than average re leasing  lower than average first year cash rents  additional asset sales  the bankruptcy of two significant customers in  and general economic conditions in each of our primary markets 
in  we expect occupancy to be lower than in primarily due to the leases rejected by worldcom and us airways 
during  the leases on approximately million rentable square feet of space  or of our portfolio  will expire 
this square footage represented approximately of our annualized revenue in as of march   approximately of this space had been re leased with existing tenants or leased to new tenants 
historically  we have renewed approximately of expiring leases with existing tenants 
we expect this re leasing percentage to be lower during in addition  we expect the average rental rate for expiring leases that have been renewed or released in to be lower than in while employment trends in the majority of our markets have begun to show signs of positive growth in  we do not anticipate that this employment growth will lead to a corresponding increase in demand for office space in improving employment in our markets will not necessarily result in positive space absorption because of the significant amount of under utilized space and space available for sublease in our markets 
customers have indicated that they are  for the most part  unwilling to commit to space expansion plans until they have a better sense of the stability of the economic recovery in the us and abroad 
in  we expect to continue our capital recycling program of selectively disposing of non core properties or other properties the sale of which can generate attractive returns 
see liquidity and capital resources capital recycling program 
although we intend to use the net proceeds from asset dispositions to repay debt  fund stockholder distributions and repurchase common stock  any net decrease in our property portfolio generally tends to result in lower net income

table of contents current and future cash needs 
historically  rental revenue has been the principal source of funds to meet our short term liquidity requirements  which primarily consist of operating expenses  debt service  stockholder distributions and ordinary course capital expenditures 
in addition  construction management  maintenance  leasing and management fees have provided sources of cash flow 
we presently have no plans for major capital improvements to the existing properties except for the million renovation of tampa bay park and the million non recurring renovation of country club plaza 
in addition  we could incur tenant improvements and lease commissions related to any releasing of space currently leased by worldcom and us air and the redevelopment of the environmental protection agency site in research triangle 
in addition to the requirements discussed above  our short term within the next months liquidity requirements also include the funding of approximately million of our existing development activity and first generation tenant improvements and lease commissions on properties placed in service that are not fully leased 
see business development activity 
we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements through a combination of working capital  cash flows from operations and the following borrowings under our unsecured revolving loan up to million of availability as of march   the selective disposition of non core assets or other assets the sale of which can generate attractive returns  the sale or contribution of some of our wholly owned properties  development projects and development land to strategic joint ventures to be formed with unrelated investors  which will have the net effect of generating additional capital through such sale or contributions  and the issuance of secured debt at march   we had billion of unencumbered real estate assets at cost 
our long term liquidity needs generally include the funding of existing and future development activity  selective asset acquisitions and the retirement of mortgage debt  amounts outstanding under the two revolving loans and long term unsecured debt 
we remain committed to maintaining a flexible capital structure 
accordingly  we expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through a combination of the issuance by the operating partnership of additional unsecured debt securities  the issuance of additional equity securities by the company and the operating partnership as well as the sources described above with respect to our short term liquidity 
we expect to use such sources to meet our long term liquidity requirements either through direct payments or repayment of borrowings under the unsecured revolving loan 
we do not intend to reserve funds to retire existing secured or unsecured indebtedness upon maturity 
instead  we will seek to refinance such debt at maturity or retire such debt through the issuance of equity or debt securities 
we anticipate that our available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operating activities  with cash available from borrowings and other sources  will be adequate to meet our capital and liquidity needs in both the short and long term 
however  if these sources of funds are insufficient or unavailable  the company s ability to make distributions to stockholders and satisfy other cash payments may be adversely affected

interest rate hedging activities 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our two revolving loans bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of long term financings and the unsecured issuance of debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  from time to time we enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as collars  swaps  caps and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments 
we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate on all of our variable rate debt is currently adjusted at one to three month intervals  subject to settlements under these contracts 
we also enter into treasury lock agreements from time to time in order to limit our exposure to an increase in interest rates with respect to future debt offerings 
net payments to counterparties under interest rate hedge contracts were  during and were recorded as additional interest expense 

table of contents share and unit repurchase program 
during  we repurchased a total of  common partnership units at a weighted average price of per unit 
since commencement of our initial share repurchase program in december  we have repurchased million shares of common stock and common units at a weighted average price of per share unit for a total purchase price of million 
on april   we announced that the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million shares of common stock and common units 
at december   we had million shares units remaining under our currently authorized additional million share unit repurchase program 
capital recycling program 
in  we expect to continue our capital recycling program of selectively disposing of non core properties or other properties the sale of which can generate attractive returns 
at february   we had million square feet of office properties and acres of land under letter of intent or contract for sale in various transactions with a carrying value of million 
these transactions are subject to customary closing conditions  including due diligence and documentation  and are expected to close during however  we can provide no assurance that all or parts of these transactions will be consummated 
we expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our disposition activity for one or all of the following purposes reduce our outstanding debt  pay shareholder distributions  or repurchase common stock subject to the factors discussed above under share and unit repurchase program 
distributions to stockholders 
to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must distribute to stockholders at least of reit taxable income 
we generally expect to use our cash flow from operating activities for distributions to shareholders and for payment of recurring  non incremental revenue generating expenditures 
the following factors will affect cash flows from operating activities and  accordingly  influence the decisions of the board of directors regarding distributions debt service requirements after taking into account debt covenants and the repayment and restructuring of certain indebtedness  scheduled increases in base rents of existing leases  changes in rents attributable to the renewal of existing leases or replacement leases  changes in occupancy rates at existing properties and execution of leases for newly acquired or developed properties  and operating expenses and capital replacement needs 
we have paid the following per share annual dividends during the past three years year per share dividend 
table of contents based on management s current expectation of future operating performance  we believe that cash available for distribution will decrease in as compared to due to lower funds from operations and higher expected capital expenditures per square foot related to the signing of new leases 
although we declared and paid a per share dividend of annualized rate of during the first quarter of  we cannot provide any assurances as to what distributions will be authorized by the board for the remaining quarters in and future periods 
if per share cash available for distribution is less than during one or more quarters in  the board may decide to use some of the net proceeds from our anticipated disposition activity to maintain a per share dividend of 
however  all distributions will be made at the discretion of the company s board of directors and will depend upon the factors discussed above 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions for disposals of a segment of business as addressed in apb reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of the disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas is effective as of january  and extends the reporting requirements of discontinued operations to include those long lived assets which are classified held for sale at december  as a result of disposal activities that were initiated subsequent to january  or were sold during as a result of disposal activities that were initiated subsequent to january  per sfas  those long lived assets which were sold during and resulted from disposal activities initiated prior to january  should be accounted for in accordance with sfas and apb we adopted sfas no

the provisions of sfas no 
related to the rescission of statement no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after may  we will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the standard is effective for disposal activities initiated after december  we will adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which changes the accounting for  and disclosure of certain guarantees 
beginning with transactions entered into after december   certain guarantees are to be recorded at fair value  which is different from prior practice  under which a liability was recorded only when a loss was probable and reasonably estimable 
in general  the change applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make payments to a guaranteed third party based on changes in underlying asset  liability  or an equity security of guaranteed party 

table of contents while the accounting provisions only apply for new transactions entered into after december   the interpretation requires us to include  and we have included  new disclosures in these financial statements 
we are assessing the impact of this interpretation on our accounting for guarantees 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends fasb no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  on january   we will adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation provisions of statement no 
in accordance with sfas  we will apply the prospective method of accounting and will expense all future employee stock options and similar awards over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  the primary objective of which is to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights 
variable interest entities or vies and to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie the primary beneficiary 
this new model applies when either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without additional financial support 
in addition  fin requires additional disclosures 
we are assessing the impact of this interpretation on our accounting for investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
funds from operations and cash available for distributions we consider funds from operations ffo to be a useful financial performance measure of the operating performance of an equity reit because  together with net income and cash flows  ffo provides investors with an additional basis to evaluate the ability of a reit to incur and service debt and to fund acquisitions and other capital expenditures 
ffo does not represent net income or cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not measure whether cash flow is sufficient to fund all cash needs  including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to stockholders 
further  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of ffo  as described below 
ffo and cash available for distributions should not be considered as alternatives to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
our calculation of ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is as follows net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  less gains or plus losses from sales of depreciable operating properties and items that are classified as extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization of assets uniquely significant to the real estate industry  and plus or minus adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
in addition  our calculation of ffo includes the add back of the transition adjustment of sfas  as this amount does not impact the comparative measurement of our operating performance 

table of contents cash available for distribution cad is defined as funds from operations reduced by non revenue enhancing capital expenditures for building improvements and tenant improvements and lease commissions related to second generation space 
in addition  cad includes both recurring and nonrecurring operating results 
as a result  nonrecurring items that are not defined as extraordinary under gaap are reflected in the calculation of cad

assumes redemption of common units for shares of common stock 
minority interest common unit holders and the stockholders of the company share equally on a per common unit and per share basis  therefore  the per share information is unaffected by conversion 

table of contents inflation in the last five years  inflation has not had a significant impact on us because of the relatively low inflation rate in our geographic areas of operation 
most of the leases require the tenants to pay their share of increases in operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance  thereby reducing our exposure to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the effects of potential changes in interest rates are discussed below 
our market risk discussion includes forward looking statements and represents an estimate of possible changes in fair value or future earnings that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in interest rates 
these disclosures are not precise indicators of expected future losses  but only indicators of reasonably possible losses 
as a result  actual future results may differ materially from those presented 
see management s discussion and analysis of results of operations liquidity and capital resources and the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
to meet in part our long term liquidity requirements  we borrow funds at a combination of fixed and variable rates 
borrowings under our two revolving loans bear interest at variable rates 
our long term debt  which consists of secured and unsecured long term financings and the issuance of unsecured debt securities  typically bears interest at fixed rates 
in addition  we have assumed fixed rate and variable rate debt in connection with acquiring properties 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs

we do not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding that was not protected by interest rate hedge contracts 
if the weighted average interest rate on this variable rate debt is basis points higher or lower during the months ended december   our interest expense would be increased or decreased approximately
