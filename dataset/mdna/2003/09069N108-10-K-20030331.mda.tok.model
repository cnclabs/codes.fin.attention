revenue is primarily derived from the following types of arrangements fee for service

if the company was merely administering plan sponsors network pharmacy contracts in which the company does not assume credit risk  but acts as an agent  the company records only the administrative or dispensing fees as revenue net 
capitated agreements 
approximately of revenues are generated from capitated contracts 
the company s capitated contracts with plan sponsors require the company to provide covered pharmacy services to plan sponsor members in return for a fixed fee per member per month paid by the plan sponsor 
capitated contracts have terms varying from six months to one year 
these contracts are subject to rate adjustment or termination upon the occurrence of certain events 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life  a reserve is established for these estimated losses 
there are currently no expected loss contracts 
co payments 
when prescriptions are filled and the company is the participating pharmacy  the company is entitled to receive co payments from members and record these co payments as revenue when the amounts are deemed collectible and reasonably estimable 
when prescriptions are filled through its retail pharmacy networks  the company is not entitled to these amounts and does not account for co payments in its financial statements as these amounts are never billed or collected by the company and it has no legal right or obligation to co payments collected by the retail pharmacies 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
rebates manufacturers rebates are recorded as estimates until such time as the rebate monies are received 
these estimates are based on historical results and trends as well as the company s forecasts 
in january  the company adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future eitf

income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes

deferred tax assets deferred tax assets are recognized based on temporary differences between book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is recorded against these assets when  in the opinion of the company  it is uncertain that the company will realize the benefit from its deferred tax assets 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of an asset may not be recoverable 
the measurement of possible impairment is based on the ability to recover the balance of assets from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
impairment losses  if any  would be determined based on the present value of the cash flows using discount rates that reflect the inherent risk of the underlying business 
it is the company s belief that no such impairment existed as of december  and results of operations specialty management and distribution services the following table provides details for the segment for the years ended december   and specialty management and distribution services in thousands inc dec inc dec revenues    cost of revenues    gross profit    gross profit percentage year ended december  vs

the tenncare r program operates under a demonstration waiver from the united states center for medicare and medicaid services cms 
that waiver is the basis of the company s ongoing service to those mcos in the tenncare r program 
the waiver expires on december  while the company believes that pharmacy benefits will continue to be provided to medicaid and other eligible tenncare r enrollees through mcos in one form or another through at least december   should the funding sources and or conditions for the tenncare r program change significantly  the tenncare r program s ability to pay the mcos  and in turn the mco s ability to pay the company  could materially and adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenues from the tenncare r program for the years  and were  and  respectively of total revenue 
historically  as a result of providing capitated pbm services to certain tenncare r mcos  the company s pharmaceutical claims costs had been subject to significant increases from october through february  which the company believes is due to the need for increased medical attention to  and intervention with  mcos members during the colder months 
the resulting increase in pharmaceutical costs impacted the profitability of capitated contracts 
currently  the company has no capitated pbm arrangements with mcos participating in the tenncare r program 
fee for service arrangements mitigate the adverse effect on profitability of higher pharmaceutical costs incurred under capitated contracts  as higher utilization positively impacts profitability 
the company presently anticipates that approximately of its total revenues for will be derived from capitated arrangements 
generally  loss contracts arise only on capitated or other risk based contracts and primarily result from higher than expected pharmacy utilization rates  higher than expected inflation in drug costs and the inability of the company to restrict its mco clients formularies to the extent anticipated by the company at the time contracted pbm services are implemented  thereby resulting in higher than expected drug costs 
at such time as management estimates that a contract will sustain losses over its remaining contractual life  a reserve is established for these estimated losses 
there are currently no loss contracts and management does not believe that there is an overall trend towards losses on its existing capitated contracts
