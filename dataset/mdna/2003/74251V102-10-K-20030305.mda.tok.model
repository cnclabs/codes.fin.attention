critical accounting policies the increasing complexity of the business environment and applicable authoritative accounting guidance requires us to closely monitor our accounting policies 
we have identified three critical accounting policies that are complex and require significant judgment 
a summary of our critical accounting policies is intended to enhance the reader s ability to assess our financial condition and results of operations and the potential volatility due to changes in estimates and changes in guidance 
valuation of invested assets valuation policies 
we classify our investments into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
we determine the appropriate classification of fixed maturity securities at the time of purchase 
fixed maturity securities include bonds  mortgage backed securities and redeemable preferred stock 
we classify our fixed maturity securities as either available for sale or trading and  accordingly  carry them at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to available for sale securities are reflected in stockholders equity net of related deferred policy acquisition costs and applicable taxes 
unrealized gains and losses related to trading securities are reflected in net income as net realized unrealized capital gains losses 
the cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts  both computed using the interest method 
the cost of fixed maturity securities is adjusted for declines in value that are other than temporary 
impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary are reported in net income as a component of net realized unrealized capital gains losses 
for loan backed and structured securities  we recognize income using a constant effective yield based on currently anticipated prepayments as determined by broker dealer surveys or internal estimates and the estimated lives of the securities 
equity securities include mutual funds  common stock and non redeemable preferred stock 
the cost of equity securities is adjusted for declines in value that are other than temporary 
impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary are reported in net income as a component of net realized unrealized capital gains losses 
equity securities are classified as available for sale and  accordingly  are carried at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses related to available for sale securities are reflected in stockholders equity net of related deferred policy acquisition costs and applicable taxes 
real estate investments are reported at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the initial cost bases of properties acquired through loan foreclosures are the lower of the fair market values of the properties at the time of foreclosure or the outstanding loan balance 
buildings and land improvements are generally depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of improvements  and tenant improvement costs are depreciated on the straight line method over the term of the related lease 
we recognize impairment losses for our properties when indicators of impairment are present and a property s expected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the property s carrying value 
in such cases  the cost bases of the properties are reduced to fair value 
real estate expected to be disposed is carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell  with valuation allowances established accordingly and depreciation no longer recognized 
any impairment losses and any changes in valuation allowances are reported in net income as net realized unrealized capital gains losses 
commercial and residential mortgage loans are generally reported at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accrual of discounts  computed using the interest method  and net of valuation allowances 
residential mortgage loans held for sale and commercial mortgage loans held for sale are carried at lower of cost or fair value  less cost to sell  and reported as mortgage loans in the statements of financial position 
mortgage loans on real estate are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when we determine that a loan is impaired  a provision for loss is established for the difference between the carrying amount of the mortgage loan and the estimated value 
estimated value is based on either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or fair value of the collateral 
the provision for losses is reported as a net realized unrealized capital loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for losses  and subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for losses 
the allowance for losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by us to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
our periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses is based on our past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may change 
we sell commercial mortgage loans to an unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity which then issues mortgage backed securities 
we may retain immaterial interests in the loans by purchasing portions of the securities from the issuance 
gain or loss on the sales of the mortgages is reported as fees and other revenues and depends in part on the previous carrying amounts of the financial assets involved in the transfer  which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
fair values are determined by quoted market prices of external buyers of each class of security purchased 
the retained interests are thereafter carried at fair value with other fixed maturity investments and classified as available for sale 
we also sell residential mortgage loans and retain servicing rights which are retained interests in the sold loans 
gain or loss on the sales of the loans is reported as fees and other revenues and depends in part on the previous carrying amounts of the loans sold and the interests retained based on their relative fair values at the date of the transfer 
to obtain fair values  quoted market prices are used if available 
however  quotes are generally not available for retained interests  so we estimate fair value based on the present value of the future expected cash flows using our best estimates of assumptions we believe market participants would use to value such interests 
corporate private placement bonds represent a primary area of credit risk exposure 
the corporate private placement bond portfolio is diversified by issuer and industry 
we monitor the restrictive bond covenants which are intended to regulate the activities of issuers and control their leveraging capabilities 
valuation models and assumptions 
since many of the fixed maturity securities that we invest in are private market assets  there are not readily available market quotes available to determine the fair market value of these assets 
these assets are valued by discounting future cash flows 
the discount rate is based on a treasury curve sourced from bloomberg  credit spreads provided by capital management sciences  and a liquidity spread add on determined by us 
the spreads used are unique by credit rating for each asset 
we also determine the credit ratings used in the process 
we must also determine the fair value of our non exchange traded derivative contracts 
many of these values are calculated via models built in bloomberg and are validated by confirmations with the counterparties and our valuation model 
assumptions including prepayment speeds  defaults  and losses are used in the assessment of both the base case and subsequent testing of yields and valuations of asset backed securities and commercial mortgage backed securities 
the assessment of the other than temporary losses and write downs of invested assets private bonds  mortgages  and real estate also involves significant judgment 
both the recognition of a triggering event timing and the market value of private assets involves subjective assessments by us 
in addition  the determination of the calculation and the adequacy of the mortgage loan reserve are also subjective 
our assessment of the adequacy of this reserve is based on our past experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying security  composition of the portfolio  and current economic conditions 
insurance reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs insurance reserves 
contractholder and policyholder liabilities contractholder funds  future policy benefits and claims and other policyholder funds include reserves for investment contracts and reserves for universal life  limited payment  participating and traditional life insurance policies 
investment contracts are contractholders funds on deposit with us and generally include reserves for pension and annuity contracts 
reserves on investment contracts are equal to the cumulative deposits less any applicable charges plus credited interest 
reserves for universal life insurance contracts are equal to cumulative premiums less charges plus credited interest which represents the account balances that accrue to the benefit of the policyholders 
reserves for non participating term life insurance contracts are computed on a basis of assumed investment yield  mortality  morbidity and expenses  including a provision for adverse deviation  which generally varies by plan  year of issue and policy duration 
investment yield is based on our experience 
mortality  morbidity and withdrawal rate assumptions are based on our experience and are periodically reviewed against both industry standards and experience 
reserves for participating life insurance contracts are based on the net level premium reserve for death and endowment policy benefits 
this net level premium reserve is calculated based on dividend fund interest rate and mortality rates guaranteed in calculating the cash surrender values described in the contract 
the amount of dividends to policyholders is approved annually by principal life s board of directors 
the amount of dividends to be paid to policyholders is determined after consideration of several factors including interest  mortality  morbidity and other expense experience for the year and judgment as to the appropriate level of statutory surplus to be retained by principal life 
at the end of the reporting period  principal life establishes a dividend liability for the pro rata portion of the dividends expected to be paid on or before the next policy anniversary date 
some of our policies and contracts require payment of fees in advance for services that will be rendered over the estimated lives of the policies and contracts 
these payments are established as unearned revenue reserves upon receipt and included in other policyholder funds in the consolidated statements of financial position 
these unearned revenue reserves are amortized to operations over the estimated lives of these policies and contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profit margins 
the liability for unpaid accident and health claims is an estimate of the ultimate net cost of reported and unreported losses not yet settled 
this liability is estimated using actuarial analyses and case basis evaluations 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that the liability for unpaid claims is adequate 
these estimates are continually reviewed and  as adjustments to this liability become necessary  such adjustments are reflected in current operations 
reserves are liabilities representing estimates of the amounts that will come due  at some point in our future  to our contractholders 
the methods of establishing reserves are prescribed by us gaap  allowing for some degree of managerial judgment 
as a basis for making management decisions  we conduct studies of our experience mortality  morbidity  investment and expense 
we compare our results to that of the industry to ensure actuarial credibility 
once this information is gathered  following common industry practices  the reserves are set 
our reserve levels are reviewed throughout the year using internal analysis  the annual audit  and statutory asset adequacy analysis 
to the extent experience indicates a potential redundancy deficiency  reserves would be released increased 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
commissions and other costs underwriting  issuance and agency expenses and first year bonus interest that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance policies and investment contract business are capitalized to the extent recoverable 
maintenance costs and acquisition costs that are not deferrable are charged to operations as incurred 
deferred policy acquisition costs for universal life type insurance contracts and participating life insurance policies and investment contracts are being amortized over the lives of the policies and contracts in relation to the emergence of estimated gross profit margins 
this amortization is adjusted retrospectively when estimates of current or future gross profits and margins to be realized from a group of products and contracts are revised 
the deferred policy acquisition costs of non participating term life insurance policies are being amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing policyholder liabilities 
deferred policy acquisition costs are subject to recoverability testing at the time of policy issue and loss recognition testing at the end of each accounting period 
deferred policy acquisition costs would be written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profit margins would not be adequate to cover related losses and expenses 
excluding non participating term life insurance policies  the deferred policy acquisition cost asset is amortized in relation to the gross profits of the underlying policies  over the expected lifetime of these policies 
at issue  the pattern of expected gross profits is established based on our expectation of future profit margins 
these profit margins contain assumptions relating to mortality  morbidity  investment yield and expenses 
as actual experience emerges  the profit margins may vary from those expected either in magnitude or timing 
for our universal life and investment contracts  we are required by accounting practice to reflect the actual gross profits of the underlying policies 
in addition  we are required to revise our assumptions regarding future experience as soon as the current assumptions become no longer actuarially credible 
both actions  reflecting actual experience and changing future estimates  can cause changes in the amount of the asset and the pattern of future amortization 
mortgage loan servicing rights mortgage loan servicing rights represent the cost of purchasing or originating the right to receive cash flows from servicing mortgage loans 
servicing rights are recorded at the time of sale of the underlying mortgage loans where the servicing is retained 
the total cost of the mortgage loans  which includes the cost to acquire the servicing rights  is allocated to the mortgage loans and the servicing rights based on their relative fair values at the date of sale 
cost basis also includes adjustments resulting from the application of hedge accounting 
capitalized servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
the capitalized value is amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net servicing income 
capitalized mortgage loan servicing rights are periodically assessed for impairment based on the estimated fair value of those rights 
fair values are estimated using estimates of discounted future net cash flows over the expected life using loan prepayment  discount rate  ancillary fee income and other economic factors we believe market participants would use to value such assets 
for purposes of performing our impairment evaluation  we stratify the servicing portfolio on the basis of certain predominant risk characteristics  including loan type and note rate 
to the extent that the carrying value of the servicing rights exceeds fair value for any stratum  a valuation allowance is established  which may be adjusted in the future as the value of the servicing rights increase or decrease 
this valuation allowance is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the period in which impairment occurs 
we must exercise certain judgments and make estimates in the application of this policy 
we have some discretion in determining interest rate assumptions to use in its estimates  but we are guided by the benchmark curve of libor swap term structure  the volatility of interest rates derived from historical volatility in libor swap rates  and the addition of mortgage spread to the modeled year swap rate to derive the mortgage refinancing rate 
we develop prepayment models internally by examining the historical prepayment experience of our portfolio  given the historical interest rate environment 
servicing cost assumptions are derived from budgeted costs  interest differential  and foreclosure losses based on historical evidence  and amortization based on expected non discounted cash flows 
servicing revenue assumptions are derived from historical experience and include principal and interest float  escrow float  prepayment float  late charges collected  and ancillary income

dig b addresses whether sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas requires bifurcation of a debt instrument into a debt host contract and an embedded derivative if the debt instrument incorporates both interest rate risk and credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the issuer of that instrument 
dig has been exposed for comment by the fasb 
it is not expected to be finalized by the fasb until sometime in the second quarter of we are currently reviewing our contracts and assessing the impact of the emerging guidance 
we do not anticipate that this will result in a material impact to our financial results  financial position or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which provides guidance related to identifying variable interest entities and determining whether such entities should be consolidated 
fin is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and effective rd quarter for any variable interest entities existing on or before january  we have initiated an assessment and are currently evaluating interests in entities that may be considered variable interest entities 
we have currently identified one variable interest entity  which meets the definition of fin and was created before january  the impact would be the consolidation of billion in assets and billion of liabilities  unless the current structure is modified 
the ultimate impact of adopting fin on the consolidated financial statements is still being reviewed 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin which requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value instead of when a loss is probable and reasonably estimated 
fin also requires disclosures even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote

in addition  the decrease reflected a million decrease from the life and health insurance segment  primarily related to the reclassification of revenues from our group universal life insurance product from premiums to fee revenues and the shift in customer preference from individual traditional life insurance products to individual universal and variable universal life insurance products  partially offset by strong disability insurance sales in the decrease also reflected a million decrease from the us asset management and accumulation segment  primarily a result of a decrease in premiums from single premium group annuities with life contingencies  which are typically used to fund defined benefit pension plan terminations 
the premium income we receive from these contracts fluctuates due to the variability in the number and size of pension plan terminations in the market  the interest rate environment and our ability to attract new sales 
fees and other revenues increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase from the mortgage banking segment primarily resulting from mortgage loan production fee revenues  reflecting the increase in mortgage loan production volume 
the increase was also due to a million increase from the life and health insurance segment  primarily related to the reclassification of revenues from our group universal life insurance product and growth in our individual universal and variable universal life insurance business 
the increase also related to a million increase from the us asset management and accumulation segment primarily related to higher fee income from improved cash flows and a reduction in losses from market value fee adjustments on our participating business from pension products 
in addition  the increases reflected a million increase from the international asset management and accumulation segment primarily as a result of an increase in the number of retirement plan participants due to the acquisition of zurich afore in mexico 
net investment income decreased million  or  to  million for the year ended december   from  million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to a decrease in investment yields 
the yield on average invested assets and cash was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this reflects a decrease in investment gains on real estate due to lower sales of certain real estate held for sale  compared to an unusually high volume of sales during in addition  the decrease reflects lower average investment yields due in part to a lower interest rate environment and to a lesser extent  due to a decrease in commercial mortgage loan prepayment fee income 
the decrease was partially offset by a  million  or  increase in average invested assets and cash 
net realized unrealized capital losses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the million capital gain realized as the result of the sale of our investment in coventry in february and the million loss on the sale of our operations in spain in  a million decrease in losses on fixed maturity securities sales  and a million decrease in losses on equity securities sales 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in other than temporary impairments of fixed maturity securities  a million increase in the other than temporary declines in the value of equity securities  an increase of million in mark to market losses on certain seed money investments  and an increase of million in losses on derivatives

liquidity and capital resources the holding companies liquidity describes the ability of a company to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
our parent holding company  principal financial group  inc  is a delaware business corporation  whose assets primarily consist of the outstanding capital stock of its subsidiaries 
as a holding company  principal financial group inc s ability to meet cash requirements  including the payments of dividends on common stock and the repurchase of stock  substantially depends upon dividends from subsidiaries  primarily principal life 
the payment of stockholder dividends by principal life to its parent company is limited by iowa laws 
under iowa laws  principal life may pay dividends only from the earned surplus arising from its business and must receive the prior approval of the insurance commissioner of the state of iowa the commissioner to pay a stockholder dividend if such a stockholder dividend would exceed certain statutory limitations 
the current statutory limitation is the greater of o of principal life s statutory policyholder surplus as of the previous year end  or o the statutory net gain from operations from the previous calendar year 
iowa law gives the commissioner discretion to disapprove requests for dividends in excess of these limits 
based on this limitation and statutory results  principal life could pay approximately million in stockholder dividends in without exceeding the statutory limitation 
principal life was able to pay approximately million in statutory dividends in based on its statutory financial results without being subject to the restrictions on payment of extraordinary stockholder dividends 
total stockholder dividends paid by principal life to its parent company in and were million and million  respectively 
another source of liquidity is issuance of our common stock 
in  proceeds from the issuance of our common stock were million 
in  net proceeds from our ipo totaled  million  of which we retained million for working capital  payment of dividends  and other general corporate purposes 
the remaining  million was contributed to principal life principally to fund demutualization compensation to policyholders in the form of policy credits and cash  and to cover certain expenses related to our demutualization 
in addition  net proceeds from the issuance of additional shares for the exercise of the over allotment options granted to the underwriters in the ipo  totaled million  all of which we retained for repurchase of shares issued in the exercise of the over allotment options 
in  we paid million in dividends to shareholders 
we paid a dividend of per share on december   to shareholders of record as of november in the last two years  our board of directors has authorized various repurchase programs under which we are allowed to purchase shares of our outstanding common stock 
shares repurchased under these programs are accounted for as treasury stock  carried at cost and reflected as a reduction to stockholders equity 
on november   our board of directors authorized a third repurchase program of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
the repurchases will be made in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions  from time to time  depending on market conditions 
no purchases were made under this program as of december  earlier in  our board of directors authorized two repurchase programs that were completed with the purchase of million shares in the open market at an aggregate cost of million 
on november   our board of directors authorized a repurchase program of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock 
this program was completed by december   with the purchase of million shares through an accelerated share repurchase program and million shares through the open market and privately negotiated transactions at an aggregate cost of million 
the million shares purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program were subject to a future contingent purchase price adjustment 
the adjustment was based upon the difference between the market price of our common stock as of december   and its volume weighted average price over an extended trading period as outlined in the forward stock purchase contract 
settlement of this contract occurred in february with a cash payment of million 
sources of liquidity also include facilities for short term and long term borrowing as needed  arranged through our intermediate holding company  principal financial services inc pfsi  and its subsidiaries 
see contractual obligations and commercial commitments below 
principal life historically  the principal cash flow sources for principal life have been premiums from life and health insurance products  pension and annuity deposits  asset management fee revenues  administrative services fee revenues  income from investments  proceeds from the sales or maturity of investments  long term debt and short term borrowings 
cash outflows consist primarily of payment of benefits to policyholders and beneficiaries  income and other taxes  current operating expenses  payment of dividends to policyholders  payments in connection with investments acquired  payments made to acquire subsidiaries  payment of dividends to parent  and payments relating to policy and contract surrenders  withdrawals  policy loans  interest expense and repayment of short term borrowings and long term debt 
principal life maintains investment strategies generally intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments 
products having liabilities with longer lives  such as life insurance and full service payout pension products  are matched with assets having similar estimated lives such as mortgage loans  long term bonds and private placement bonds 
shorter term liabilities are matched with investments such as short and medium term fixed maturities 
in addition  highly liquid  high quality short term investments are held to fund anticipated operating expenses  surrenders  withdrawals and development and maintenance expenses associated with new products and technologies 
our privately placed fixed maturity securities  commercial mortgage loans and real estate investments are generally less liquid than our publicly traded fixed maturity securities 
as of december  and  these asset classes represented approximately and  respectively  of the value of our consolidated invested assets 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk for a discussion of duration matching 
life insurance companies generally produce a positive cash flow from operations  as measured by the amount by which cash inflows are adequate to meet benefit obligations to policyholders and normal operating expenses as they are incurred 
the remaining cash flow is generally used to increase the asset base to provide funds to meet the need for future policy benefit payments and for writing and acquiring new business 
it is important to match the investment portfolio maturities to the cash flow demands of the type of annuity  investment or insurance product being provided 
principal life continuously monitors benefits  surrenders and maturities to provide projections of future cash requirements 
as part of this monitoring process  principal life performs cash flow testing of many of its assets and liabilities under various scenarios to evaluate the adequacy of reserves 
in developing its investment strategy  principal life establishes a level of cash and securities which  combined with expected net cash inflows from operations  maturities of fixed maturity investments and principal payments on mortgage backed securities and commercial mortgage loans  are believed adequate to meet anticipated short term and long term benefit and expense payment obligations 
there can be no assurance that future experience regarding benefits and surrenders will be similar to historic experience since withdrawal and surrender levels are influenced by such factors as the interest rate environment and the claims paying ability and financial strength ratings of principal life 
principal life takes into account asset liability management considerations in the product development and design process 
contract terms of and of principal life s universal and variable universal life insurance products as of december  and  respectively  include surrender and withdrawal provisions which mitigate the risk of losses due to early withdrawals 
these provisions generally do one or more of the following limit the amount of penalty free withdrawals  limit the circumstances under which withdrawals are permitted  or assess a surrender charge or market value adjustment relating to the underlying assets 
the market value adjustment feature in principal life s fixed annuity products adjusts the surrender value of a contract in the event of surrender prior to the end of the contract period to protect principal life against losses due to higher interest rates at the time of surrender 
our gics and funding agreements contain provisions limiting early surrenders  including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements 
put provisions give customers the option to terminate a contract prior to maturity  provided they give a minimum notice period 
the following table presents us gaap reserves for guaranteed investment contracts and funding agreements by withdrawal provisions as of december  and as of december  in millions book value out puttable less than days put to days put to days put more than days put no active put provision total puttable surrenderable book value out without surrender charge book value out with surrender charge total surrenderable total book value out market value out less than days notice to days notice to days notice  more than days notice   no active surrender provision total market value out   not puttable or surrenderable   total gics and funding agreements   book value out the amount equal to the sum of deposits less withdrawals with interest accrued at the contractual interest rate

international operations we expect to receive approximately million of proceeds from our sale of substantially all of bt financial group to westpac 
this amount includes cash proceeds  expected tax benefits  and a gain from unwinding the hedged asset associated with debt used to acquire bt financial group in an additional future contingent receipt of million may by received in  if westpac experiences growth in their retail assets under management 
as of december   we have received million of the expected proceeds 
our brazilian and chilean operations  along with one of our mexican companies  produced positive cash flow from operations for the years ended december  and these cash flows have been historically maintained at the local country level for strategic expansion purposes 
our international operations have required an infusion of capital of million for the year ended december   primarily to fund our acquisitions of zurich afore and afore tepeyac in mexico 
we have also required infusions of capital of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily to meet the cash outflow requirements of our international operations

sources and uses of cash of consolidated operations net cash provided by operating activities was  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively

net cash used in investing activities was  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in compared to was primarily due to an increase during in the volume of net mortgage loans purchased and sold 
also contributing to the increase in cash used was the decline in real estate sales from the prior year 
offsetting these increases in cash used was the sale of substantially all of bt financial group  as well as the sale of our shares of coventry stock

the increase in net cash used in compared to is primarily from the non recurrence of the impact from the prior year s ipo  in addition to the repurchase of shares or our common stock and payments of dividends in partially offsetting the increases in cash used was an increase in investment contract deposits  net of withdrawals 
the decrease in cash used in compared to was primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds from issuance of common stock in conjunction with our ipo 
partially offsetting this decrease in cash used were payments made to eligible policyholders as part of our demutualization and the repurchase of shares of our common stock 
given the historical cash flow of our subsidiaries and the financial results of these subsidiaries  we believe the cash flow from our consolidated operating activities over the next year will provide sufficient liquidity for our operations  as well as satisfy interest payments and any payments related to debt servicing

off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into certain contracts to fund residential mortgage loan production  and sell qualifying delinquent residential mortgage loans 
as appropriate under us gaap  the contracts involve special purpose entities spes or trusts that are not reported on our consolidated statement of financial position 
residential mortgage loan production 
in june  our mortgage banking segment created a special purpose bankruptcy remote entity  principal residential mortgage capital resources  llc prmcr  to provide an off balance sheet source of funding for our residential mortgage loan production 
we sell eligible residential mortgage loans to prmcr  where they are warehoused until sold to the final investor 
we sold approximately billion and billion in mortgage loans to prmcr in and  respectively 
the maximum amount of mortgage loans  which can be warehoused in prmcr  has increased from billion at inception to billion as of december  prmcr held billion and billion in mortgage loans held for sale as of december  and  respectively 
the portfolio of loans held for sale by prmcr must meet portfolio criteria  eligibility representations  and portfolio aging limitations 
based on these eligibility representations  we are required to repurchase ineligible loans from prmcr 
during  we repurchased million of ineligible loans from prmcr 
prmcr is capitalized by equity certificates owned by third party investors not affiliated with us or our affiliates  directors  or officers and thus  is not consolidated 
the equity holders bear the risk of loss on defaulted mortgages 
at december  and  prmcr had outstanding equity certificates of million 
prmcr also issues short term secured liquidity notes as well as medium term notes to provide funds for its purchase of mortgage loans from us 
at december   prmcr had outstanding secured liquidity notes of billion  three year fixed term notes of million and five year variable term notes of million 
at december   prmcr had outstanding secured liquidity notes of billion  three year fixed term notes of million and five year variable term notes of million 
all borrowings are collateralized by the assets of prmcr 
we paid a commitment fee to prmcr based on the overall warehouse limit 
prmcr used a portion of the fee to fund a cash collateral account maintained at prmcr 
these funds are available as additional collateral to cover credit related losses on defaulted mortgage loans 
the balance in the account was million at december  and  and is reflected in other assets on our consolidated statements of financial position 
we maintain a right to the servicing of the mortgage loans held by prmcr and retain servicing upon the sale of the majority of the mortgage loans to the final investors 
as the servicer  we receive a monthly servicing fee and may earn additional incentive servicing fees upon successful completion of our servicing responsibilities 
we received million and million in servicing and incentive servicing fees from prmcr in and  respectively 
any unpaid and earned incentive fees as well as any remaining amounts in the cash collateral account will be returned to us upon the termination of prmcr 
additionally  as the servicer  we are required to advance to prmcr those payments due from borrowers  but not received  as of specified cutoff dates 
in addition  we perform certain secondary marketing  accounting and various administrative functions on behalf of prmcr 
in order to hedge interest rate risk and non credit related market value risk associated with its inventory of mortgage loans held for sale  prmcr entered into swaps with counterparties not affiliated with us or prmcr 
the swap counterparties are required to maintain certain minimum ratings as approved by the rating agencies 
through separate swap agreements with the swap counterparties that mirror the original swaps with prmcr  the interest rate risk and non credit related market value components are swapped back to us 
delinquent residential mortgage loan funding 
in october  our mortgage banking segment created a wholly owned  unconsolidated qualifying special purpose entity  principal residential mortgage funding  llc prmf  to provide an off balance sheet source of funding for up to million of qualifying delinquent mortgage loans 
the limit was increased to million in december we sell qualifying delinquent fha and va mortgage loans to prmf which then transfers the loans to principal residential mortgage ebo trust trust  an unaffiliated delaware business trust 
the trust funds its acquisitions of mortgage loans by selling participation certificates  representing an undivided interest in the trust  to commercial paper conduit purchasers  who are not affiliated with us or any of our affiliates  directors or officers 
at december  and  the trust held million and million in mortgage loans  respectively 
and had outstanding participation certificates of million and million  respectively 
residential mortgage loans typically remain in the trust until they are processed through the foreclosure claim process  are paid off or reinstate 
mortgage loans that reinstate are no longer eligible to remain in the trust and are required to be removed at fair market value by us at the monthly settlement date following reinstatement 
we are retained as the servicer of the mortgage loans and also perform accounting and various administrative functions on behalf of prmf  in our capacity as the managing member of prmf 
as the servicer  we receive a servicing fee pursuant to the pooling and servicing agreement 
we may also receive a successful servicing fee only after all other conditions in the monthly cash flow distribution are met 
we received million and million in servicing and successful servicing fees from prmf in and  respectively 
at december  and  our residual interest in such cash flows was million and million  respectively  and was recorded in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position 
the value of the residual interest was based on the net present value of expected cash flows from prmf  reduced by estimates of foreclosure losses associated with the related loans 
we are required to advance funds for payment of interest on the participation certificates and other carrying costs  if sufficient cash is not available in the trust collection account to meet this obligation 
we and the trust are parties to a cost of funds hedge agreement 
we pay the weighted average cost of funds on the participation certificates plus fees and expenses and receive weighted average coupon of mortgage loans in the trust less a spread 
guarantees and indemnifications our fundamental business approach is to avoid guarantees or other commitments to or on behalf of affiliated companies of principal financial group  inc affiliates are encouraged to operate as autonomously as possible  however  there are instances where a rated entity within principal financial group  inc provides a guarantee to or on behalf of an affiliate 
the guarantees typically supplement a partially secured transaction  but require the additional enhancement provided by the guarantee to make the transaction more economical for our organization 
various businesses throughout our organization have a range of standard guarantees and commitments to or on behalf of affiliated entities within the organization in connection with managing the risks of these businesses 
we continually manage liabilities that have any acceleration  additional collateral support  changes in terms  or creation of additional financial obligations in our regular liquidity analysis 
we have found all of these obligations to be manageable and do not believe they materially impact our liquidity or capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we have provided guarantees to third parties primarily on behalf of real estate associates  a former subsidiary and joint ventures 
these agreements generally expire from through the estimated maximum exposure under these agreements is approximately million  however  we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required and therefore have not accrued for a liability on our consolidated statement of financial position 
should we be required to perform under these guarantees  we could recover a portion of the loss from third parties through recourse provisions included in agreements with such parties  the sale of assets held as collateral that can be liquidated in the event that performance is required under the guarantees or other recourse available to us  minimizing the impact to our results of operations 
we are also subject to certain indemnification obligations under agreements with previously sold subsidiaries and other transactions arising under the normal course of business 
while we are unable to estimate with certainty the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to these indemnifications  we believe the likelihood is remote that material payments would be required under such indemnifications and therefore would not result in a material adverse affect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
investments we had total consolidated assets as of december   of billion  of which billion were invested assets 
the rest of our total consolidated assets are comprised primarily of separate account assets for which we do not bear investment risk 
because we generally do not bear any investment risk on assets held in separate accounts  the discussion and financial information below does not include such assets 
of our invested assets  billion were held by our us operations and the remaining billion were held by our international asset management and accumulation segment 
us investment operations our us invested assets are managed by principal global investors  a subsidiary of principal life 
our primary investment objective is to maximize after tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters 
we seek to protect policyholders benefits by optimizing the risk return relationship on an ongoing basis  through asset liability matching  reducing the credit risk  avoiding high levels of investments that may be redeemed by the issuer  maintaining sufficiently liquid investments and avoiding undue asset concentrations through diversification 
we are exposed to three primary sources of investment risk o credit risk  relating to the uncertainty associated with the continued ability of a given obligor to make timely payments of principal and interest  o interest rate risk  relating to the market price and or cash flow variability associated with changes in market yield curves  and o equity risk  relating to adverse fluctuations in a particular common stock 
our ability to manage credit risk is essential to our business and our profitability 
we devote considerable resources to the credit analysis of each new investment 
we manage credit risk through industry  issuer and asset class diversification 
our investment committee  appointed by our board of directors  establishes all investment policies and reviews and approves all investments 
as of december   there are eleven members on the investment committee  one of whom is a member of our board of directors 
the remaining members are senior management members representing various areas of our company 
we also seek to reduce call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates in individual investments 
we limit our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer  and we require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk that the issuer will exercise such option 
we assess option risk in all investments we make and  when we take that risk  we price for it accordingly 
our fixed income securities committee  consisting of fixed income securities senior management members  approves the credit rating for the fixed maturity securities we purchase 
teams of security analysts organized by industry focus either on the public or private markets and analyze and monitor these investments 
in addition  we have teams who specialize in residential mortgage backed securities  commercial mortgage backed securities and public below investment grade securities 
we establish a credit reviewed list of approved public issuers to provide an efficient way for our portfolio managers to purchase liquid bonds for which credit review has already been completed 
issuers remain on the list for six months unless removed by our analyst 
our analysts monitor issuers on the list on a continuous basis with a formal review documented every six months or more frequently if material events affect the issuer 
the analysis includes both fundamental and technical factors 
the fundamental analysis encompasses both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the issuer 
the qualitative analysis includes an assessment of both accounting and management aggressiveness 
in addition  technical indicators such as stock price volatility and credit default swap levels are monitored 
our fixed income securities committee also reviews private transactions on a continuous basis to assess the quality ratings of our privately placed investments 
we regularly review our investments to determine whether we should re rate them  employing the following criteria o material declines in the issuer s revenues or margins  o significant management or organizational changes  o significant uncertainty regarding the issuer s industry  o debt service coverage or cash flow ratios that fall below industry specific thresholds  o violation of financial covenants  and o other business factors that relate to the issuer 
a dedicated risk management team is responsible for centralized monitoring of the commercial mortgage portfolio 
we apply a variety of strategies to minimize credit risk in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
when considering the origination of new commercial mortgage loans  we review the cash flow fundamentals of the property  make a physical assessment of the underlying security  conduct a comprehensive market analysis and compare against industry lending practices 
we use a proprietary risk rating model to evaluate all new and a majority of existing loans within the portfolio 
the proprietary risk model is designed to stress projected cash flows under simulated economic and market downturns 
our lending guidelines are designed to encourage or less loan to value ratios and a debt service coverage ratio of at least times 
we analyze investments outside of these guidelines based on cash flow quality  tenancy and other factors 
the weighted average loan to value ratio at origination for brick and mortar commercial mortgages in our portfolio was and the debt service coverage ratio at loan inception was times as of december  we have limited exposure to equity risk in our common stock portfolio 
equity securities accounted for only of our us invested assets as of december  our investment decisions and objectives are a function of the underlying risks and product profiles of each primary business operation 
in addition  we diversify our product portfolio offerings to include products that contain features that will protect us against fluctuations in interest rates 
those features include adjustable crediting rates  policy surrender charges and market value adjustments on liquidations 
for further information on our management of interest rate risk  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
overall composition of us invested assets us invested assets as of december   were predominantly of high quality and broadly diversified across asset class  individual credit  industry and geographic location 
as shown in the following table  the major categories of us invested assets are fixed maturity securities and commercial mortgages 
the remainder is invested in real estate  equity securities and other assets 
in addition  policy loans are included in our invested assets

our residential mortgage backed securities are managed to reduce the risk of prepayment by holding securities that trade close to par 
this active management has resulted in the realization of capital gains and losses with respect to such investments 
fixed maturity securities fixed maturity securities consist of short term investments  publicly traded debt securities  privately placed debt securities and redeemable preferred stock  and represented of total us invested assets as of december  and as of december  the fixed maturity securities portfolio was comprised  based on carrying amount  of in publicly traded fixed maturity securities and in privately placed fixed maturity securities as of december   and in publicly traded fixed maturity securities and in privately placed fixed maturity securities as of december  included in the privately placed category as of december   were billion of securities eligible for resale to qualified institutional buyers under rule a under the securities act of fixed maturity securities were diversified by category of issuer as of december   and december   as shown in the following table us invested assets fixed maturity securities by type of issuer as of december  as of december  carrying of carrying of amount total amount total in millions us treasury securities and obligations of us government corporations and agencies states and political subdivisions foreign governments corporate public   corporate private   residential pass through securities   commercial mbs   asset backed securities   total fixed maturities   we held  million of mortgage backed and asset backed securities as of december   and  million as of december  we believe that it is desirable to hold residential mortgage backed securities due to their credit quality and liquidity as well as portfolio diversification characteristics 
our portfolio is comprised of gnma  fnma and fhlmc pass through securities and is actively managed to reduce the risk of prepayment by holding securities that are trading close to par 
commercial mortgage backed securities provide high levels of credit protection  diversification  reduced event risk and enhanced liquidity 
commercial mortgage backed securities are predominantly comprised of rated large pool securitizations that are individually and collectively diverse by property type  borrower and geographic dispersion 
we purchase asset backed securities  abs  to diversify the overall credit risks of the fixed maturity securities portfolio and to provide attractive returns 
the principal risks in holding asset backed securities are structural and credit risks 
structural risks include the security s priority in the issuer s capital structure  the adequacy of and ability to realize proceeds from the collateral and the potential for prepayments 
credit risks involve issuer servicer risk where collateral values can become impaired in the event of servicer credit deterioration 
our abs portfolio is diversified both by type of asset and by issuer 
we actively monitor holdings of asset backed securities to ensure that the risk profile of each security improves or remains consistent 
if we are not receiving an adequate yield for the risk  relative to other investment opportunities  we will attempt to sell the security 
prepayments in the abs portfolio are  in general  insensitive to changes in interest rates or are insulated to such changes by call protection features 
in the event that we are subject to prepayment risk  we monitor the factors that impact the level of prepayment and prepayment speed for those asset backed securities 
to the extent we believe that prepayment risk increases  we may attempt to sell the security and reinvest in another security that offers better yield relative to the risk 
in addition  we diversify the risks of asset backed securities by holding a diverse class of securities  which limits our exposure to any one security 
in accordance with our asset liability risk management techniques  we manage the expected lives of us invested assets to be similar to the lives of our liabilities 
significant amounts of our liabilities have an expected life of six years or less 
therefore  comparable amounts of assets have a similar expected life 
the international exposure in our us invested assets totaled  million  or  of total fixed maturity securities  as of december   comprised of corporate and foreign government fixed maturity securities 
of the  million as of december   investments totaled  million in the united kingdom  million in the continental european union  million in asia  million in australia  million in south america and million in japan 
the remaining million was invested in other countries 
all international fixed maturity securities held by our us operations are either denominated in us dollars or have been swapped into us dollar equivalents 
our international investments are analyzed internally by country and industry credit investment professionals 
we control concentrations using issuer and country level exposure benchmarks  which are based on the credit quality of the issuer and the country 
our investment policy limits total international fixed maturity securities investments to of total statutory general account assets with a limit in emerging markets 
exposure to canada is not included in our international exposure due to its treatment by the naic 
as of december   our investments in canada totaled  million 
as of december   no individual non government issuer represented more than of us invested assets 
the securities valuation office of the naic evaluates most of the fixed maturity securities that we and other us insurance companies hold 
the securities valuation office evaluates the bond investments of insurers for regulatory reporting purposes and assigns securities to one of six investment categories 
the naic designations closely mirror the nationally recognized securities rating organizations credit ratings for marketable bonds 
naic designations and include bonds considered investment grade by such rating organizations 
bonds are considered investment grade when rated baa or higher by moody s  or bbb or higher by standard poor s 
naic designations through are referred to as below investment grade 
bonds are considered below investment grade when rated ba or lower by moody s  or bb or lower by standard poor s 
we also monitor the credit drift of our corporate fixed maturity securities portfolio 
credit drift is defined as the ratio of the percentage of rating downgrades  including defaults  divided by the percentage of rating upgrades 
we measure credit drift once each fiscal year  assessing the changes in our internally developed credit ratings that have occurred during the year 
standard poor s annual credit ratings drift ratio measures the credit rating change  within a specific year  of companies that have been assigned ratings by standard poor s 
the annual internal credit drift ratio on corporate fixed maturity securities we held in our general account was times compared to the standard poor s drift ratio of times  as of december  the following table presents our total fixed maturity securities by naic designation and the equivalent ratings of the nationally recognized securities rating organizations as of december   and december   as well as the percentage  based on estimated fair value  that each designation comprises us invested assets total fixed maturity securities by credit quality as of december  as of december  of of rating total total naic agency amortized carrying carrying amortized carrying carrying rating equivalent cost amount amount cost amount amount in millions aaa aa a     baa     ba     b caa and lower in or near default total fixed maturities     we believe that our long term fixed maturity securities portfolio is well diversified among industry types and between publicly traded and privately placed securities 
each year we direct the majority of our net cash inflows into investment grade fixed maturity securities 
our current policy is to limit the percentage of cash flow invested in below investment grade assets to of cash flow 
as of december   we had invested of new cash flow for the year in below investment grade assets 
while the general account investment returns have improved due to the below investment grade asset class  we manage its growth strategically by limiting it to of the total fixed maturity securities portfolios 
we invest in privately placed fixed maturity securities to enhance the overall value of the portfolio  increase diversification and obtain higher yields than are possible with comparable quality public market securities 
generally  private placements provide broader access to management information  strengthened negotiated protective covenants  call protection features and  where applicable  a higher level of collateral 
they are  however  generally not freely tradable because of restrictions imposed by federal and state securities laws and illiquid trading markets

we define problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities i as to which principal and or interest payments are in default or ii issued by a company that went into bankruptcy subsequent to the acquisition of such securities 
we define potential problem securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities included on an internal watch list for which management has concerns as to the ability of the issuer to comply with the present debt payment terms and which may result in the security becoming a problem or being restructured 
the decision whether to classify a performing fixed maturity security as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by our management as to the likely future industry conditions and developments with respect to the issuer 
we define restructured securities in our fixed maturity portfolio as securities where a concession has been granted to the borrower related to the borrower s financial difficulties that would not have otherwise been considered 
we determine that restructures should occur in those instances where greater economic value will be realized under the new terms than through liquidation or other disposition and may involve a change in contractual cash flows

residential mortgages comprised  million and  million  or and  of total mortgage loan investments as of december   and december   respectively 
principal residential mortgage  inc and principal bank hold the majority of residential loans 
principal residential mortgage  inc holds residential loans as part of its securitization inventory and principal bank holds residential loans to comply with federal thrift charter requirements 
commercial mortgage loans 
commercial mortgages play an important role in our investment strategy by o providing strong risk adjusted relative value in comparison to other investment alternatives  o enhancing total returns  and o providing strategic portfolio diversification 
as a result  we have focused on constructing a solid  high quality portfolio of mortgages 
our portfolio is generally comprised of mortgages with conservative loan to value ratios  high debt service coverages and general purpose property types with a strong credit tenancy 
our commercial loan portfolio consists of primarily non recourse  fixed rate mortgages on fully or near fully leased properties 
the mortgage portfolio is comprised of general purpose industrial properties  manufacturing office properties and credit oriented retail properties 
california accounted for of our commercial mortgage loan portfolio as of december  we are  therefore  exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of catastrophes  such as earthquakes  that may affect the region 
like other lenders  we generally do not require earthquake insurance for properties on which we make commercial mortgage loans 
with respect to california properties  however  we obtain an engineering report specific to each property 
the report assesses the building s design specifications  whether it has been upgraded to meet seismic building codes and the maximum loss that is likely to result from a variety of different seismic events 
we also obtain a report that assesses by building and geographic fault lines the amount of loss our commercial mortgage loan portfolio might suffer under a variety of seismic events 
our commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified by borrower 
as of december   of the us commercial mortgage loan portfolio was comprised of mortgage loans with principal balances of less than million 
the total number of commercial mortgage loans outstanding as of december  and december  was  and  respectively 
the average loan size of our commercial mortgage portfolio was million as of december  as of such dates  all such loans were performing 
we actively monitor and manage our commercial mortgage loan portfolio 
substantially all loans within the portfolio are analyzed regularly  based on a proprietary risk rating cash flow model  in order to monitor the financial quality of these assets and are internally rated 
based on ongoing monitoring  mortgage loans with a likelihood of becoming delinquent are identified and placed on an internal watch list 
among criteria which would indicate a potential problem are imbalances in ratios of loan to value or contract rents to debt service  major tenant vacancies or bankruptcies  borrower sponsorship problems  late payments  delinquent taxes and loan relief restructuring requests 
we state commercial mortgage loans at their unpaid principal balances  net of discount accrual and premium amortization  valuation allowances and write downs for impairment 
we provide a valuation allowance for commercial mortgage loans based on past loan loss experience and for specific loans considered to be impaired 
mortgage loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement may not be collected 
when we determine that a loan is impaired  we establish a valuation allowance for loss for the excess of the carrying value of the mortgage loan over its estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
we record increases in such valuation allowances as realized investment losses and  accordingly  we reflect such losses in our consolidated results of operations 
such increases decreases in valuation allowances aggregated million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we review our mortgage loan portfolio and analyze the need for a valuation allowance for any loan which is delinquent for days or more  in process of foreclosure  restructured  on the watch list  or which currently has a valuation allowance 
we categorize loans  which are delinquent  loans in process of foreclosure and loans to borrowers in bankruptcy as problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans placed on an internal watch list for which management has concerns as to the ability of the borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms and which may result in the loan becoming a problem or being restructured 
the decision whether to classify a performing loan as a potential problem involves significant subjective judgments by management as to the likely future economic conditions and developments with respect to the borrower 
we categorize loans for which the original terms of the mortgages have been modified or for which interest or principal payments have been deferred as restructured loans 
we also consider matured loans that are refinanced at below market rates as restructured 
we charge mortgage loans deemed to be uncollectible against the allowance for losses and credit subsequent recoveries to the allowance for losses 
we maintain the allowance for losses at a level management believes to be adequate to absorb estimated probable credit losses 
management bases its periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for losses on our past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of the underlying collateral  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and other relevant factors 
the evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimating the amounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impaired loans that may change

we own real estate  real estate acquired upon foreclosure of commercial mortgage loans and interests  both majority owned and non majority owned  in real estate joint ventures 
equity real estate is categorized as either real estate held for investment or real estate held for sale 
real estate held for investment totaled  million as of december   and million as of december  the carrying value of real estate held for investment is generally adjusted for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
such impairment adjustments are recorded as realized investment losses and accordingly  are reflected in our consolidated results of operations 
for the years ended december  and december   there were no such impairment adjustments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures and risk management market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse fluctuations in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates  although we also have exposures to changes in equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the active management of market risk is an integral part of our operations 
we manage our overall market risk exposure within established risk tolerance ranges by using the following approaches o rebalance our existing asset or liability portfolios  o control the risk structure of newly acquired assets and liabilities  or o use derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets or liabilities or assets expected to be purchased 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate risk stems largely from our substantial holdings of guaranteed fixed rate liabilities in our us asset management and accumulation segment 
we manage the interest rate risk inherent in our assets relative to the interest rate risk inherent in our liabilities 
one of the measures we use to quantify this exposure is duration 
to calculate duration  we project asset and liability cash flows 
these cash flows are discounted to a net present value basis using a spot yield curve  which is a blend of the spot yield curves for each of the asset types in the portfolio 
duration is calculated by re calculating these cash flows and re determining the net present value based upon an alternative level of interest rates  and determining the percentage change in fair value 
as of december   the difference between the asset and liability durations on our primary duration managed portfolio was years 
this duration gap indicates that as of this date the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is greater than that of the fair value of our liabilities 
our goal is to minimize the duration gap 
currently  our guidelines dictate that total duration gaps between the asset and liability portfolios must be within years 
the value of the assets in this portfolio was  million as of december  for products such as whole life insurance and term life insurance that are less sensitive to interest rate risk  and for other products such as single premium deferred annuities  we manage interest rate risk based on a modeling process that considers the target average life  maturities  crediting rates and assumptions of policyholder behavior 
as of december   the weighted average difference between the asset and liability durations on these portfolios was years 
this duration gap indicates that as of this date the sensitivity of the fair value of our assets to interest rate movements is less than that of the fair value of our liabilities 
we attempt to monitor this duration gap consistent with our overall risk reward tolerances 
the value of the assets in these portfolios was  million as of december  we also have a block of participating general account pension business that passes the actual investment performance of the assets to the customer 
the investment strategy of this block is to maximize investment return to the customer on a best efforts basis  and there is little or no attempt to manage the duration of this portfolio since there is little or no interest rate risk 
the value of the assets in these portfolios was  million as of december using the assumptions and data in effect as of december   we estimate that a basis point immediate  parallel increase in interest rates increases the net fair value of our portfolio by million 
the following table details the estimated changes by risk management strategy as of risk management december  net fair value strategy value of total assets change in millions primary duration managed  duration monitored  non duration managed  total  we are also exposed to interest rate risk in our mortgage banking segment 
we manage this risk by striving to balance our loan origination and loan servicing operations  the two of which are generally counter cyclical 
in addition  we use various financial instruments  including derivatives contracts  to manage the interest rate risk specifically related to committed loans in the pipeline and mortgage servicing rights 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management policies is to offset changes in the values of these items resulting from changes in interest rates 
we do not speculate on the direction of interest rates in our management of interest rate risk 
we manage interest rate risk on our mortgage loan pipeline by buying and selling mortgage backed securities in the forward markets  over the counter options on mortgage backed securities  us treasury and eurodollar futures contracts and options on futures contracts 
we also use interest rate floors  futures contracts  options on futures contracts  swaps and swaptions  mortgage backed securities and principal only strips in hedging a portion of our portfolio of mortgage servicing rights from prepayment risk associated with changes in interest rates 
we measure pipeline interest rate risk exposure by adjusting the at risk pipeline in light of the theoretical optionality of each applicant s rate price commitment 
the at risk pipeline  which consists of closed loans and rate locks  is then refined at the product type level to express each product s sensitivity to changes in market interest rates in terms of a single current coupon mbs duration benchmark interest rate 
suitable hedges are selected and a similar methodology applied to this hedge position 
the variety of hedging instruments allows us to match the behavior of the financial instrument with that of the different types of loans originated 
price sensitivity analysis is performed at least once daily 
the face amount of the loans in the pipeline as of december   was billion 
due to the impact of our hedging activities  we estimate that a basis point immediate and sustained increase in the benchmark interest rates decreases the december   net position value by million 
the financial risk associated with our mortgage servicing operations is the risk that the fair value of the servicing asset falls below its us gaap book value 
to measure this risk  we analyze each servicing risk tranche s us gaap book value in relation to the then current fair value for similar servicing rights 
we perform this valuation using option adjusted spread valuation techniques applied to each risk tranche 
we produce tranche fair values at least monthly and model our net servicing hedge position at least daily 
the fair value of the servicing asset declines as interest rates decrease due to possible mortgage loan servicing rights impairment that may result from increased current and projected future prepayment activity 
the change in value of the servicing asset due to interest rate movements is partially offset by the use of financial instruments  including derivative contracts that typically increase in aggregate value when interest rates decline 
based on values as of december   a basis point immediate parallel and sustained decrease in interest rates produces a million decline in value of the servicing asset of our mortgage banking segment  net of the impact of these hedging vehicles  due to the differences between fair values and us gaap book values 
cash flow volatility cash flow volatility arises as a result of several factors 
one is the inherent difficulty in perfectly matching the cash flows of new asset purchases with that of new liabilities 
another factor is the inherent cash flow volatility of some classes of assets and liabilities 
in order to minimize cash flow volatility  we manage differences between expected asset and liability cash flows within pre established guidelines 
we also seek to minimize cash flow volatility by restricting the portion of securities with redemption features held in our invested asset portfolio 
these asset securities include redeemable corporate securities  mortgage backed securities or other assets with options that  if exercised  could alter the expected future cash inflows 
in addition  we limit sales liabilities with features such as puts or other options that may change the cash flow profile of the liability portfolio 
derivatives we use various derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  including interest rate swaps  principal only swaps  interest rate floors  swaptions  us treasury futures  treasury rate guarantees  interest rate lock commitments and mortgage backed forwards and options 
we use interest rate futures contracts and mortgage backed forwards to hedge changes in interest rates subsequent to the issuance of an insurance liability  such as a guaranteed investment contract  but prior to the purchase of a supporting asset  or during periods of holding assets in anticipation of near term liability sales 
we use interest rate swaps and principal only swaps primarily to more closely match the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities 
they can be used to change the sensitivity to the interest rate of specific assets and liabilities as well as an entire portfolio 
occasionally  we will sell a callable liability or a liability with attributes similar to a call option 
in these cases  we will use interest rate swaptions or similar products to hedge the risk of early liability payment thereby transforming the callable liability into a fixed term liability 
we also seek to reduce call or prepayment risk arising from changes in interest rates in individual investments 
we limit our exposure to investments that are prepayable without penalty prior to maturity at the option of the issuer  and we require additional yield on these investments to compensate for the risk that the issuer will exercise such option 
an example of an investment we limit because of the option risk is residential mortgage backed securities 
we assess option risk in all investments we make and  when we assume such risk  we seek to price for it accordingly to achieve an appropriate return on our investments 
we have increased our credit exposure through credit default swaps by investing in subordinated tranches of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation 
the outstanding notional amount as of december  was million and the mark to market value was million pre tax 
we also invested in credit swaps creating replicated assets with a notional of million and mark to market value of million as of december  in conjunction with our use of derivatives  we are exposed to counterparty risk  or the risk that counterparty fails to perform the terms of the derivative contract 
we actively manage this risk by o establishing exposure limits which take into account non derivative exposure we have with the counterparty as well as derivative exposure  o performing similar credit analysis prior to approval on each derivatives counterparty that we do when lending money on a long term basis  o diversifying our risk across numerous approved counterparties  o limiting exposure to a credit or better  o conducting stress test analysis to determine the maximum exposure created during the life of a prospective transaction  and o daily monitoring of counterparty credit ratings 
all new derivative counterparties are approved by the investment committee 
we believe the risk of incurring losses due to nonperformance by our counterparties is manageable 
the notional amounts used to express the extent of our involvement in swap transactions represent a standard measurement of the volume of our swap business 
notional amount is not a quantification of market risk or credit risk and it may not necessarily be recorded on the balance sheet 
notional amounts represent those amounts used to calculate contractual flows to be exchanged and are not paid or received  except for contracts such as currency swaps 
actual credit exposure represents the amount owed to us under derivative contracts as of the valuation date

as of december   the fair value of our equity securities was million 
a decline in the value of the equity securities would result in an unrealized loss of million 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
this risk arises from our international operations and foreign currency denominated funding agreements issued to non qualified institutional investors in the international market 
the notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign denominated liabilities as of december   was  million 
we also have fixed maturity securities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
however  we use derivatives to hedge the foreign currency risk  both interest payments and the final maturity payment  of these funding agreements and securities 
as of december   the fair value of our foreign currency denominated fixed maturity securities was million 
we use currency swap agreements of the same currency to hedge the foreign currency exchange risk related to these investments 
the notional amount of our currency swap agreements associated with foreign denominated fixed maturity securities as of december   was million 
with regard to our international operations  we attempt to do as much of our business as possible in the functional currency of the country of operation 
at times  however  we are unable to do so  and in these cases  we use foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the resulting risks 
we estimate that as of december   a immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed would result in no change to the net fair value of our foreign currency denominated instruments identified above  including the currency swap agreements 
the selection of a immediate unfavorable change in all currency exchange rates should not be construed as a prediction by us of future market events  but rather as an illustration of the potential impact of such an event 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation  in the united states or in the other countries in which we operate  has had a material effect on our consolidated operations over the past five years 
in the future  however  we may be affected by inflation to the extent it causes interest rates to rise
