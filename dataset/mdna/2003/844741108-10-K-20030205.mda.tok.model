item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year in review in  southwest posted a profit for the th consecutive year 
while the company s profitability fell short of our historical standards  this performance was remarkable given that the major airlines collectively reported losses in the billions of dollars 
from a financial perspective  was one of the worst years  if not the worst  in the history of commercial aviation 
it was a year that included dramatic increases in aviation insurance costs  increased passenger security costs resulting from continually evolving security laws and directives  airline industry downsizing  rising energy prices  and a recessionary airline revenue environment 
however  the company s business strategy predominantly shorthaul  high frequency  low fare  point to point  high quality customer service  low costs continued to serve southwest well throughout the year 
the company has been able to combat many of these higher exogenous costs by lowering distribution costs and implementing other cost reduction measures 
throughout the difficult period beginning with the september  terrorist attacks the company has been profitable every quarter 
during  southwest successfully met the challenge of dramatic changes in airport security 
initially  these security changes dramatically altered airport checkin procedures resulting in longer checkin times for customers 
the company invested in additional airport facilities  new technology  changed processes and added employees 
these actions  at most airports  restored checkin times to normal durations 
specific changes to the way customers and baggage are processed included the implementation of computer generated baggage tags to electronically track bags checked by customers  computer generated boarding passes from multiple points in the airport  and the installation of self service rapid check in kiosks at airports 
although the transportation security administration has successfully assumed responsibility for passenger and baggage screening  and has complied with all federal security mandates as required by the aviation and transportation security act  the company is currently unable to predict what impact future mandates  if any  will have on the company s ongoing operations and future financial performance 
although the company did not open any new cities in  it did improve its quality of service between cities already served and added new aircraft to facilitate this growth 
these additions  along with the retirement of three older aircraft  resulted in a net capacity increase of percent  and brought the company s all fleet to aircraft at the end of the company ended serving airports in states 
available seat mile asm capacity is expected to grow approximately four percent in with the planned net addition of aircraft 
the company currently has new boeing s scheduled for delivery during the year and plans to retire six of the company s older s

operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or percent compared to consolidated results for and included million and million  respectively  in gains that the company recognized from grants under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act air stabilization act 
consolidated results for also included million in additional passenger revenue from a reduction in estimated refunds and exchanges  contributing to an increase in forfeited tickets included in air traffic liability 
consolidated results for also included special pre tax charges of approximately million arising from the terrorist attacks 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that comparative analysis of results can be enhanced by excluding the impact of these special items

following the terrorist attacks  all us commercial flight operations were suspended for approximately three days 
however  the company continued to incur nearly all of its normal operating expenses with the exception of certain direct trip related expenditures such as fuel  landing fees  etc the company canceled approximately  flights before resuming flight operations on september  although it did not resume its normal pre september flight schedule until september  after operations were fully resumed  load factors and passenger yields were severely impacted  and ticket refund activity increased 
the company estimates that from september through september   it incurred operating losses in excess of million 
operating revenues consolidated operating revenues decreased million  or 
percent  primarily due to a million  or 
percent  decrease in passenger revenues 
the decrease in passenger revenues was due to lower load factors revenue passenger miles or rpms divided by available seat miles or asms attributable to the post september  reduction in demand for air travel  and from lower passenger yields passenger revenue divided by rpms caused by a decline in full fare traffic 
the company s load factor for was percent  compared to percent for  resulting from a capacity asm increase of percent versus an rpm increase of only percent 
excluding special items  passenger yields for were 
compared to 
in  a decrease of percent 
in  there continued to be heavy fare discounting by the company and the airline industry in general to stimulate demand 
the increase in capacity  as measured by asms  was due to the net addition of aircraft during net of three aircraft retirements 
for the full year  the company experienced a percent decrease in revenue passengers carried and a percent increase in average length of passenger haul rpms divided by revenue passengers carried 
the company s load factor was attained only through heavy promotional activities and aggressive revenue management 
load factors thus far in january and bookings for february and march have been satisfactory 
however  we expect the air fare environment to continue to be weak  relative to pre september  performance  through the first quarter if current booking and revenue trends continue  first quarter unit revenues should  however  exceed first quarter s unit revenue of 
consolidated freight revenues decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a percent decrease in mail revenues 
following the terrorist attacks  the united states postal service shifted a portion of the mail that commercial carriers had previously carried to freight carriers 
the mail decrease more than offset an percent increase in other freight revenues 
other revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored first usa r visa card 
operating expenses consolidated operating expenses for increased million  or percent  compared to the percent increase in capacity 
operating expenses per asm decreased percent to  primarily due to decreases in profitsharing expense  average jet fuel costs  and commission expense

cents salaries  wages  and benefits expense per asm increased percent due to a percent increase in salaries and wages per asm and a percent increase in benefits expense per asm  partially offset by a percent decrease in employee retirement plans expense per asm 
the majority of the increase in salaries and wages was due to headcount additions outpacing the company s capacity growth in several operational areas  due in part to additional security requirements at airports 
the remaining portion of the increase in salaries and wages per asm was primarily due to increases in average wage rates 
the increase in benefits expense per asm was primarily due to higher health care costs 
employee retirement plans expense per asm decreased primarily due to the decrease in company earnings available for profitsharing 
in and  earnings available for profitsharing included million and million  respectively  from grants recognized under the air stabilization act 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company also expects to experience an increase in salaries  wages  and benefits per asm in due to the continued impact of headcount additions in excess of capacity growth  higher average wage rates  and higher anticipated health care costs 
the company s mechanics are subject to an agreement negotiated with the international brotherhood of teamsters the teamsters  that became amendable in august the company reached a tentative agreement with the teamsters  which was ratified by its membership in october on january   the aircraft mechanics fraternal association was certified by the national mediation board as the new representative of the mechanics

the company s flight attendants are subject to an agreement with the twu that became amendable in june southwest is currently in negotiations with the twu for a new contract 
fuel and oil expense per asm decreased percent  primarily due to a percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average cost per gallon of jet fuel in was 
compared to 
in  excluding fuel related taxes but including the effects of hedging activities 
the company s and average jet fuel costs are net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities  respectively 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has hedges in place for approximately percent of its anticipated fuel consumption in  including all of its anticipated requirements for first quarter considering current market prices and the continued effectiveness of the company s fuel hedges  the company is forecasting first quarter average fuel cost per gallon to be in the 
to 
range 
the majority of the company s near term hedge positions are in the form of option contracts  which protect the company in the event of rising jet fuel prices 
the company should also benefit  to a large extent  in the event of a decline in jet fuel prices 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in airframe expense resulting from fewer outsourced heavy maintenance events versus more heavy maintenance events were performed internally in  resulting in the costs associated with those events being reflected in salaries and wages 
currently  the company expects an increase in maintenance materials and repairs expense per asm in first quarter and full year  versus  due to an increase in contract rates from outside vendors as well as the number of engine inspections and repairs scheduled 
the majority of the company s engine maintenance work is outsourced 
agency commissions per asm decreased percent  primarily due to a change in the company s commission rate policy 
effective october   the company reduced the commission paid to travel agents from eight percent for ticketless bookings and five percent for paper ticket bookings  to five percent with no cap  regardless of the type of ticket sold 
in addition  the mix of tickets sold through travel agents declined from percent in to percent in  thereby reducing commissionable revenues and commission expense 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
approximately percent of the company s aircraft were under operating lease at december   compared to percent at december  based on the company s current new aircraft delivery schedule  scheduled aircraft retirements for  and financing plans  the company expects a decline in aircraft rental expense per asm in  including the first quarter 
landing fees and other rentals per asm increased percent primarily as a result of airport rate increases throughout the company s system 
moreover  following the terrorist attacks  most other major airlines reduced their flight schedules due to the drop in air travel 
since southwest did not reduce its flights  the company incurred higher airport costs based on a greater relative share of total flights and passengers 
depreciation expense per asm increased percent primarily due to growth in the company s owned aircraft fleet 
the company received delivery of new aircraft during  all of which were purchased 
other operating expenses per asm decreased percent despite a per asm increase of more than percent in aviation insurance costs 
the insurance cost increases were more than offset through various cost control measures implemented immediately following the prior year terrorist attacks  including reductions in personnel related expenses and office expenses excluding insurance expense  other operating expenses per asm decreased percent 
following the terrorist attacks  commercial aviation insurers significantly increased the premiums and reduced the amount of war risk coverage available to commercial carriers 
the federal government then stepped in to provide supplemental third party war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers  for renewable days periods  at substantially lower premiums than prevailing commercial rates during and for levels of coverage not available in the commercial market 
in november  congress passed the homeland security act of  which mandated the federal government provide third party  passenger and hull war risk insurance coverage to commercial carriers through august   and which permits such coverage to be extended by the government through december  the company is unable to predict whether the government will extend this insurance coverage past august   whether alternative commercial insurance with comparable coverage will become available at reasonable premiums  and what impact the outcome will have on the company s ongoing operations or future financial performance 
as a result of recently concluded negotiations for commercial insurance coverage and the additional coverage provided by the government  the company currently expects per asm insurance costs to decrease compared to for at least the near term  including first quarter other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense increased million  or percent compared to the prior year  due to higher debt levels 
in fourth quarter  the company issued million in long term debt in the form of pass through certificates 
in first quarter  the company issued million in unsecured notes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these two borrowings 
the increase in expense caused by these borrowings was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt and the july redemption of million of unsecured notes 
capitalized interest decreased million  or percent  primarily as a result of lower progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries  compared to based on the company s current schedule of progress payments and aircraft deliveries  the company expects progress payment balances  and corresponding capitalized interest  to increase in compared to interest income decreased million  or percent  as higher invested cash balances for the year were more than offset by lower rates 
other gains in and primarily resulted from million and million  respectively  received as the company s share of government grant funds under the air stabilization act

operating income for was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to operating revenues consolidated operating revenues decreased million  or percent  primarily due to a percent decrease in passenger revenues 
the decrease in passenger revenues was a direct result of the terrorist attacks 
from january through august  passenger revenues were higher by million  or percent  than the same period in primarily due to an increase in capacity  as measured by asms  of percent 
this capacity increase was due to the addition of aircraft during all prior to september and its revenue effects were partially offset by a decrease of percent in passenger yield 
passenger yield decreased as a result of fare discounting by the company and the airline industry in general as the united states economy weakened throughout the company s load factor rpms divided by asms over this time period was percent  compared to percent for the same period in from september through december  passenger revenues were million  or percent  lower than the same period of capacity increased percent and the company s load factor fell to percent  compared to percent during the same period of passenger yields were percent lower during this period  versus the same period in  due to aggressive fare sales following the terrorist attacks 
for the full year  the company experienced a percent increase in revenue passengers carried  a percent increase in revenue passenger miles rpms  and a percent increase in asms 
the company s load factor for was off points  to percent  and there was a percent decrease in passenger yield 
as a result of weak economic conditions throughout  consolidated freight revenues decreased million  or percent 
there were decreases in both the number of freight shipments and revenue per shipment 
other revenues increased million  or percent  primarily due to an increase in commissions earned from programs the company sponsors with certain business partners  such as the company sponsored first usa visa card

cents salaries  wages  and benefits per asm increased percent due to a percent increase in salaries and wages per asm  and a percent increase in benefits expense per asm  partially offset by a percent decrease in employee retirement plans expense per asm 
the increase in salaries and wages per asm was primarily due to higher average wage rates within certain workgroups and increased headcount due  in part  to the increased security requirements following the september terrorist attacks 
the increase in benefits expense per asm was primarily due to higher benefits costs  primarily health care 
the decrease in employee retirement plans expense per asm was primarily due to the decrease in company earnings available for profitsharing 
this decrease in earnings more than offset an increase in expense due to a fourth quarter amendment made to the company s profitsharing plan 
this amendment enabled the company to take into consideration federal grants under the act and special charges resulting from the terrorist attacks in the calculation of profitsharing 
fuel and oil expense per asm decreased percent  primarily due to a percent decrease in the average jet fuel cost per gallon 
the average cost per gallon of jet fuel in was 
compared to 
in  including the effects of hedging activities 
the company s and average jet fuel prices are net of approximately million and million in gains from hedging activities  respectively 
maintenance materials and repairs per asm decreased percent 
this decrease was primarily due to the company s capacity growth exceeding the increase in expense 
virtually all of the company s capacity growth versus the prior year was accomplished with new aircraft  most of which have not yet begun to incur any meaningful repair costs 
a decrease in engine expense was partially offset by an increase in expense for airframe inspections and repairs 
in addition to an increase in the number of airframe inspections and repairs  the cost per event increased compared to agency commissions per asm decreased percent  primarily due to a change in the company s commission rate policy 
effective january   the company reduced the commission rate paid to travel agents from ten percent to eight percent for ticketless bookings  and from ten percent to five percent for paper ticket bookings 
effective october   the company reduced the commission paid to travel agents to five percent with no cap  regardless of the type of ticket sold 
in addition  the mix of tickets sold through travel agents declined from percent in to percent in  thereby reducing commissionable revenues and commission expense 
aircraft rentals per asm decreased percent primarily due to a lower percentage of the aircraft fleet being leased 
approximately percent of the company s aircraft were under operating lease at december   compared to percent at december  landing fees and other rentals per asm increased percent primarily as a result of the company s expansion of facilities at several airports  including baltimore washington international airport and chicago midway airport 
depreciation expense per asm increased percent primarily due to the growth in the company s aircraft fleet prior to the terrorist attacks 
the company had received delivery of new aircraft prior to september  bringing the percentage of owned aircraft in the company s fleet to percent by the end of compared to percent at the end of other operating expenses per asm increased percent primarily due to a significant increase in aviation insurance costs following the terrorist attacks 
the company s insurance carriers canceled their war risk and terrorism insurance policies following the terrorist attacks and reinstated such coverage at significantly higher rates than before 
other other expenses income included interest expense  capitalized interest  interest income  and other gains and losses 
interest expense was flat compared to following the terrorist attacks  the company borrowed the full million available under its revolving credit facility and issued million in long term debt in the form of pass through certificates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in expense caused by these borrowings was offset by a decrease in interest rates on the company s floating rate debt and the july redemption of million of unsecured notes 
capitalized interest decreased million  or percent  primarily as a result of lower progress payment balances for scheduled future aircraft deliveries as compared to the lower progress payments were due in part to the deferral of boeing aircraft firm orders and options following the terrorist attacks 
interest income increased million  or percent  primarily due to higher invested cash balances  partially offset by lower rates 
other gains in primarily resulted from million received as the company s share of government grant funds under the air stabilization act  intended to offset the company s direct and incremental losses caused by the terrorist attacks  through the end of see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the air stabilization act and grants from the government 
income taxes the provision for income taxes  as a percentage of income before taxes  decreased slightly to percent in from percent in the decrease primarily resulted from lower effective state tax rates in liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to billion in the decrease in operating cash flows was primarily due to the decrease in net income and the deferral of approximately million in excise tax payments until january  as provided for in the air stabilization act 
cash flows used in investing activities in totaled million compared to million in investing activities in both years consisted primarily of payments for new aircraft delivered to the company and progress payments for future aircraft deliveries 
of the new aircraft the company put into service during  were recorded on the consolidated statement of cash flows and on the consolidated balance sheet through the consolidation of a special purpose trust the trust during see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the trust 
a total of eight new aircraft were recorded through consolidation of the trust during the remaining four new aircraft delivered to the company in were purchased directly from boeing 
the trust was dissolved prior to december  net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to cash generated by financing activities of billion in cash used in financing activities during was primarily for the repayment of the company s million revolving credit facility that the company drew down in september and for the repayment of the trust 
these uses were partially offset by cash generated from the issuance of million in unsecured notes in march financing cash flows in were generated from borrowings the company made from its million revolving credit facility and the issuance of million in long term debt 
these borrowings were partially offset by the redemption of million unsecured notes in see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on these financing activities 
cash generated in and in was primarily used to finance aircraft related capital expenditures and provide working capital 
the company has various options available to meet its capital and operating commitments  including cash on hand at december   of billion  internally generated funds  and a million bank revolving line of credit 
in addition  the company will also consider various borrowing or leasing options to maximize earnings and supplement cash requirements 
the company believes it has access to a wide variety of financing arrangements because of its excellent credit ratings  unencumbered assets  modest leverage  and consistent profitability 
the company has an available revolving credit facility from which it can borrow up to million from a group of banks 
one half of the facility is short term and expires on april  if not drawn before that date 
the other one half expires on april  the company expects that it will be able to renew the expiring day facility for an additional day period at reasonable terms 
if the company is unable to renew  the company s available credit facility will be reduced 
the company currently has outstanding shelf registrations for the issuance of up to billion in public debt securities and pass through certificates  which it may utilize for aircraft financings in the future 
in  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases are made in accordance with applicable securities laws in the open market or in private transactions from time to time  depending on market conditions  and may be discontinued at any time 
as of december   in aggregate  million shares had been repurchased at a total cost of million  of which million was completed in no shares were repurchased in or in contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments southwest has contractual obligations and commitments primarily with regards to future purchases of aircraft  payment of debt  and lease arrangements

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  tickets sold are initially deferred as air traffic liability 
passenger revenue is recognized and air traffic liability is reduced when the service is provided ie  when the flight takes place 
air traffic liability primarily represents tickets sold for future travel dates and estimated future refunds  exchanges  or forfeitures of tickets sold for past travel dates 
the company s air traffic liability balance at december  was million 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
tickets that are sold but not flown on the travel date can be reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is refundable 
a small percentage of tickets or partial tickets expire unused 
fully refundable tickets are rarely forfeited 
air traffic liability includes an estimate of the amount of future refunds  exchanges  and forfeitures for all unused tickets once the flight date has passed 
these estimates are based on historical experience over many years 
the company and members of the airline industry have consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from forfeited tickets at the date travel is provided 
estimated future refunds and exchanges included in the air traffic liability account are constantly evaluated based on subsequent refund and exchange activity to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets 
events and circumstances outside of historical fare sale activity or historical customer travel patterns can result in actual refunds  exchanges or forfeited tickets differing significantly from estimates  however  these differences have historically not been material 
additional factors that may affect estimated refunds include  but may not be limited to  the company s refund and exchange policy  the mix of refundable and nonrefundable fares  and fare sale activity 
the company s estimation techniques have been consistently applied from year to year  however  as with any estimates  actual refund and exchange activity may vary from estimated amounts 
since september  the company has experienced fluctuations in estimated refunds and exchanges  and correspondingly  forfeited tickets  due to many of the factors described above 
following the terrorist events of september   and the subsequent temporary shutdown of us air space  southwest temporarily suspended its normal refund policy in order to provide the highest service to the company s customers  including the refunding of nonrefundable tickets upon customer request 
as a result  the company experienced refunds during september and through december far above historical refund levels and in excess of the company s contractual obligations 
in evaluating passenger revenue through third quarter  based on these unusually high refund levels  the company estimated that approximately million of these refunds related to revenue previously recognized for estimated forfeited tickets 
as a result  the company reduced third quarter passenger revenue by million and restored air traffic liability  accordingly 
subsequent to third quarter and through second quarter  the company experienced a higher than usual mix of low fare  nonrefundable ticket sales 
the company also experienced changes in customer travel patterns resulting from various factors including new airport security measures  concerns about further terrorist attacks  and an uncertain economy 
consequently  the company recorded million in additional passenger revenue in second quarter as customers required fewer refunds and exchanges  resulting in more forfeited tickets 
while the company believes the current estimates included in air traffic liability and passenger revenue are reasonable  these estimates may continue to change based on refund  exchange and forfeiture activity varying from pre september patterns 
accounting for long lived assets as of december   the company had approximately billion of long lived assets  including billion in flight equipment and related assets 
in accounting for long lived assets  the company must make estimates about the expected useful lives of the assets  the expected residual values of the assets  and the potential for impairment based on the fair value of the assets and the cash flows they generate 
in estimating the lives and expected residual values of its aircraft  the company has primarily relied upon actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and recommendations from boeing  the manufacturer of the company s aircraft 
subsequent revisions to these estimates  which can be significant  could be caused by changes to the company s maintenance program  changes in utilization of the aircraft actual flight hours during a given period of time  governmental regulations on aging aircraft  and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions each reporting period and  when warranted  adjusts these estimates and assumptions 
generally  these adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense  as required by gaap 
the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets for impairment 
factors that would indicate potential impairment include  but are not limited to  significant decreases in the market value of the long lived asset s  a significant change in the long lived asset s physical condition  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
while the airline industry as a whole has experienced many of these indicators  southwest has continued to operate all of its aircraft and continues to experience positive cash flow 
consequently  the company has not identified any impairments related to its existing aircraft fleet 
the company will continue to monitor its long lived assets and the airline operating environment 
financial derivative instruments the company utilizes financial derivative instruments to manage its risk associated with changing jet fuel prices  and accounts for them under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas see qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk for more information on these risk management activities 
sfas requires that all derivatives be marked to market fair value and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the company s financial derivative instruments recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of december   was million 
since the majority of the company s financial derivative instruments are not traded on a market exchange  the company estimates their fair values 
depending on the type of instrument  the values are determined by the use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
also  since there is not a reliable forward market for jet fuel  the company must estimate the future prices of jet fuel in order to measure the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting changes to those prices  as required by sfas forward jet fuel prices are estimated through the observation of similar commodity futures prices such as crude oil and heating oil and adjusted based on historical variations to those like commodities 
fair values for financial derivative instruments and forward jet fuel prices are both estimated prior to the time that the financial derivative instruments settle  and the time that jet fuel is purchased and consumed  respectively 
however  once settlement of the financial derivative instruments occur and the hedged jet fuel is purchased and consumed  all values and prices are known and are realized in the financial statements 
based on these actual results once all values and prices become known  the company s estimates have proved to be materially accurate 
furthermore  since the majority of the company s hedges settle within to months from the time the company enters into the contract for the derivative financial instrument  the estimates being made are relatively short term 
estimating the fair value of these fuel hedging derivatives and forward prices for jet fuel will also result in changes in their values from period to period and thus determine how they are accounted for under sfas to the extent that the period to period change in the estimated fair value of a fuel hedging instrument differs from a period to period change in the estimated price of the associated jet fuel to be purchased  ineffectiveness of the fuel hedge will result  as defined by sfas this could result in the immediate recording of charges or income  even though the derivative instrument may not expire until a future period 
historically  the company has not experienced significant ineffectiveness in its fuel hedges accounted for under sfas see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on sfas and the company s fuel hedging activities 
forward looking statements some statements in this form k or otherwise made by the company or on the company s behalf from time to time in other reports  filings with the securities and exchange commission  news releases  conferences  world wide web postings or otherwise which are not historical facts may be forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of and the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements include statements about southwest s estimates  expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies for the future  and the assumptions underlying these forward looking statements

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk southwest has interest rate risk in that it holds floating rate debt instruments and has commodity price risk in that it must purchase jet fuel to operate its aircraft fleet 
the company purchases jet fuel at prevailing market prices  but seeks to minimize its average jet fuel cost through execution of a documented hedging strategy 
southwest has market sensitive instruments in the form of fixed rate debt instruments and derivative instruments used to hedge its exposure to jet fuel price increases 
the company also operates aircraft under operating and capital leases 
however  leases are not considered market sensitive financial instruments and  therefore  are not included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis below 
commitments related to leases are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on the company s accounting for its hedging program and note to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the company s financial derivative instruments 
fuel hedging 
the fair values of outstanding financial derivative instruments related to the company s jet fuel market price risk at december   were a net asset of million 
the current portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is classified as fuel hedge contracts in the consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of these financial derivative instruments  or million  is included in other assets 
the fair values of the derivative instruments  depending on the type of instrument  were determined by use of present value methods or standard option value models with assumptions about commodity prices based on those observed in underlying markets 
an immediate ten percent increase or decrease in underlying fuel related commodity prices from the december   prices would correspondingly change the fair value of the commodity derivative instruments in place by approximately million 
changes in the related commodity derivative instrument cash flows may change by more or less than this amount based upon further fluctuations in futures prices as well as related income tax effects 
this sensitivity analysis uses industry standard valuation models and holds all inputs constant at december  levels  except underlying futures prices 
financial market risk 
airline operators are inherently capital intensive as the vast majority of the company s assets are expensive aircraft  which are long lived 
the company s strategy is to capitalize conservatively and grow capacity steadily and profitably 
while the company uses financial leverage  it has maintained a strong balance sheet and an a credit rating on its senior unsecured fixed rate debt with standard poor s and fitch ratings agencies  and a baa credit rating with moody s rating agency 
the company s aircraft secured notes and french credit agreements do not give rise to significant fair value risk but do give rise to interest rate risk because these borrowings are floating rate debt 
although there is interest rate risk associated with these secured borrowings  the risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the company may prepay this debt on any of the semi annual principal and interest payment dates 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on the material terms of the company s short term and long term debt 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company had outstanding senior unsecured notes totaling million at december  in addition  as disclosed in note  the company had outstanding long term fixed rate debt totaling million in the form of pass through certificates certificates  which are secured by aircraft the company owns 
the total of the company s long term unsecured notes represented percent of total noncurrent assets at december  the unsecured long term debt currently has a weighted average maturity of years at fixed rates averaging percent at december   which is comparable to average rates prevailing for similar debt instruments over the last ten years 
the certificates bear interest at a combined weighted average rate of percent 
the company does not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on its unsecured long term debt or its certificates because the interest rates are fixed and the financial leverage is modest 
the company also has some risk associated with changing interest rates due to the short term nature of its invested cash  which was billion at december  the company invests available cash in certificates of deposit  highly rated money markets  and investment grade commercial paper that generally have maturities of three months or less  therefore  the returns earned on these investments parallel closely with floating interest rates 
the company has not undertaken any additional actions to cover interest rate market risk and is not a party to any other material market interest rate risk management activities 
a hypothetical ten percent change in market interest rates as of december   would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
a change in market interest rates could  however  have a corresponding effect on the company s earnings and cash flows associated with its aircraft secured notes  french credit agreements  and invested cash because of the floating rate nature of these items 
assuming floating market rates in effect as of december   were held constant throughout a month period  a hypothetical ten percent change in those rates would correspondingly change the company s net earnings and cash flows associated with these items by approximately million 
using these assumptions and considering the company s cash balance and floating rate debt outstanding at december   an increase in rates would have a net positive effect on the company s earnings and cash flows  while a decrease in rates would have a net negative effect on the company s earnings and cash flows 
however  a ten percent change in market rates would not impact the company s earnings or cash flow associated with the company s publicly traded fixed rate debt  or its certificates 
the company is also subject to various types of liquidity and financing risk included in agreements with financial institutions that process credit card transactions on behalf of the company  the company s revolving credit facility  and outstanding debt agreements 
such risks included the company maintaining minimum credit ratings  the company s assets for secured debt maintaining minimum fair values  and the company achieving minimum covenant ratios with regard to its available or outstanding debt agreements 
the company met or exceeded the minimum standards set forth in these agreements as of december  however  if conditions change and the company failed to meet the minimum standards set forth in the agreements  it could reduce the availability of cash under the agreements or increase the costs to keep the agreements intact as written
