item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references to  and mean the fiscal years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
recent developments on january   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of privately held pennsylvania crusher corporation penn crusher 
as a result of this purchase  we also acquired jeffrey specialty equipment corporation jeffrey  a wholly owned subsidiary of penn crusher 
the purchase price consisted of a combination of  in cash   in unsecured promissory notes and a post closing cash payment of  based on penn crusher s consolidated shareholders equity at december  with respect to the payment of the cash portion of the purchase price and related acquisition costs  we financed  through a  secured credit facility with penn crusher as the borrower the additional  is available for working capital and general corporate purposes  subject to certain limitations 
this facility is directly with penn crusher  and the lender has no recourse against k tron with respect to any amounts borrowed thereunder 
additionally  we borrowed  from a us bank through a k tron wholly owned subsidiary and used these funds to pay part of the purchase price 
this obligation was guaranteed by k tron  and k tron also issued the  of unsecured promissory notes 
penn crusher and jeffrey had consolidated revenues of  which were more than fifty percent of k tron s total revenues in with regard to the operation of penn crusher and jeffrey  we expect that they will be operated on a stand alone basis  with no significant financial or operational synergies between them and k tron 
as noted above  k tron and penn crusher incurred substantial debt as a result of the penn crusher acquisition  which debt is described in more detail in the liquidity and capital resources section below  however  k tron and penn crusher expect to have sufficient cash flow to cover all required principal and interest payments and  in particular  penn crusher s cash flow should be adequate to cover required principal and interest payments on its secured credit facility 
results of operations in  and  k tron reported net income of   and  respectively 
revenues for declined from and levels even after excluding the july  sale of our hasler heavy feeder business  which is described below  and the november  acquisition of pneumatic conveying systems limited pcs  reflecting a weaker global economy and a steep decline in capital equipment spending in the process industries we serve 
the improvement in net income in versus was largely the result of two factors i the sale of our hasler heavy feeder business in the third quarter of and ii the benefits of a lower cost structure resulting from the globalization and cost reduction initiatives that we implemented in the second half of we are an international company  and we derived approximately  and of our  and revenues  respectively  from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities located outside the united states  primarily in europe 
since we operate globally  we are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange rates  which can affect both the translation of financial statement items into us dollars as well as transactions where the revenues and related expenses may initially be accounted for in different currencies  such as sales made from our swiss manufacturing facility in currencies other than the swiss franc 
on july   we sold our hasler heavy feeder business to our largest distributor of hasler equipment and recorded a pretax loss of  the assets sold were primarily inventory and fixed assets 
the buyer took over operation of our hasler leased sales office in neuchatel  switzerland and leased from us a company owned facility in lengerich  germany 
the purchase price consisted of a combination of  swiss francs cash  promissory notes in the principal amount of  swiss francs  which bear interest and amortize over seven years  and a less than equity position in the buyer 
we retained all of the hasler receivables and payables at the time of the sale as well as the building in lengerich  germany  which  as noted above  is being leased to the buyer 
the buyer has made all required payments on the promissory notes  and the principal amount was reduced to  swiss francs at the end of 
the us dollar numbers mentioned in this paragraph reflect the swiss franc us dollar exchange rate at the dates referred to  which were july  and december  in december  we sold our swiss machine and welding shops to an independent swiss machine shop company and recorded a pretax gain of  the purchase price consisted of a combination of  swiss francs cash  and a  swiss franc obligation  which is supported by a bank guaranty 
the following table sets forth our results of operations expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year total revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development operating income interest income before income taxes year end backlog at year end foreign exchange rates  in thousands backlog including hasler business    backlog excluding hasler business sold july     as previously noted  more than half of our revenues in recent years has been derived from activities in foreign jurisdictions 
consequently  our results can be significantly affected by changes in foreign exchange rates  particularly in us dollar exchange rates with respect to the swiss franc  euro and british pound sterling and  to a lesser degree  the singapore dollar and other currencies 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales decreases 
when the non us dollar weakens against these currencies  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales increases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  since we typically receive a majority of our revenues in currencies other than the us dollar  we generally benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide  especially those identified above 
in particular  a general weakening of the us dollar against other currencies would positively affect our revenues  gross profit and operating income as expressed in us dollars provided that the gross profit and operating income numbers from foreign operations are not losses  since in the case of a loss  the effect would be to increase the loss  whereas a general strengthening of the us dollar against such currencies would have the opposite effect 
in addition  our revenues and income with respect to particular transactions may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates where sales are made in currencies other than the functional currency of the facility manufacturing the product subject to the sale  including in particular the us dollar swiss franc for inter company transactions and the swiss franc euro and swiss franc british pound sterling for sales from the company s swiss manufacturing facility exchange rates 
for  and  the changes in certain key exchange rates were as follows fiscal year average us dollar equivalent of one swiss franc change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average us dollar equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one euro change vs 
prior year average swiss franc equivalent of one british pound sterling change vs 
prior year with the acquisition of penn crusher and jeffrey  we will be less affected in the future by foreign exchange rates since most of their sales are in us dollars 
nevertheless  between and of our revenues will likely be from products manufactured in  and services performed from  our facilities outside the united states  so that we will continue to have significant sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
total revenues decreased by  or increased by  or without hasler in compared to the increase in revenues without hasler was driven by twelve full months of revenues in from the november  acquisition of pcs versus one month in and the positive effect of a weaker us dollar when translating the revenues of foreign operations into us dollars  partially offset by lower revenues in emea asia and the americas due to a weaker global economy with reduced capital equipment spending in the process industries we serve 
if the average foreign exchange rates for were applied to  total revenues for would have decreased by  or decreased by  or without hasler 
total revenues decreased by  or  or without hasler in compared to most of the revenue decrease was attributable to north america  reflecting the weak economy and a steep decline in capital equipment spending in the plastics and chemical industries  with a small portion of the decrease resulting from a reduction in hasler revenues in western europe 
the effect of foreign exchange translation was minimal when comparing with gross profit as a percent of total revenues increased to in as compared to in the improvement in gross profit was primarily due to the improved sales mix as a result of the july  sale of the hasler business and to reductions in fixed costs  including the cost reductions made in the second half of and the elimination of goodwill expense as we adopted sfas no 
on december  goodwill amortization for was  gross profit as a percent of total revenues decreased to in as compared to in the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to geographic and product sales mix 
another factor was the deterioration in economic conditions discussed above  which led to fixed costs being absorbed over a smaller revenue base 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased by  or in compared to a decrease of approximately  or after excluding hasler sg a  the loss on sale of the hasler business and the gain on sale of the swiss machine and welding shops discussed above 
the decrease in sg a was primarily due to the elimination of hasler sg a after the sale of hasler on july   fewer employees and the benefits realized from one time costs associated with cost reductions implemented in the second half of  offset in part by the effect of higher foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased by  or in compared to  or after excluding the loss on sale of the hasler business and gain on sale of the swiss machine and welding shops discussed above 
the decrease in sg a was primarily due to lower commissions on reduced revenues  fewer employees and the elimination of hasler sg a after july   offset in part by a  net loss on the assets sold 
as a percent of total revenues  sg a was in  in and in research and development r d expenditures decreased by  or in compared to and by  or in compared to r d decreased in and as compared to and  respectively  due to lower staff costs  partly resulting from the sale of the hasler business 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in tooling costs and by the effect of higher foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar 
r d expense as a percent of total revenues was in and in and interest expense decreased by  or in versus and by  or in as compared to the decrease was due to lower interest rates and debt reductions of  in switzerland  at constant foreign exchange rates and  in the united states  partially offset by higher foreign exchange rates a weaker us dollar 
the decrease was due to lower interest rates and debt reductions 
interest expense as a percent of total revenues was in  in and in income before income taxes was  in   in and  in the changes during the periods were the result of the items discussed above  with the income before income taxes improving versus  despite lower revenues in  primarily as a result of the hasler sale and the benefits of the globalization and cost reductions initiatives which we implemented during the latter half of the  and provisions for income tax of   and  respectively  related primarily to our results in the united states and switzerland in and the united states and germany in and the effective tax rates were in  in and in the higher effective tax rate in was primarily due to an increase in foreign taxable income in as compared to  which included a loss in both switzerland and germany on the sale of the hasler business 
on july   new jersey approved legislation for corporation income tax reform 
the changes made to the law accounted for an increase in the tax provision for of approximately  after the related federal income tax benefit 
the lower effective tax rate in versus was primarily due to a one time benefit from a german tax law change 
we have foreign and us state tax loss carryforwards that total  and  respectively  which  if realized  would have an estimated future net income benefit of  and  respectively 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations during the last three years 
our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates decreased by at the end of compared to due to the very weak capital equipment spending environment that existed during all of  and it reflected fewer orders received at our feeder group facilities in switzerland and the united states 
the bulk of the year end backlog consisted of orders that should be ready for delivery in less than days 
our backlog at constant foreign exchange rates decreased by without the hasler business at the end of compared to  primarily due to reduced orders from customers in the united states 
liquidity and capital resources recent developments to finance the penn crusher acquisition described earlier  we borrowed  from two us banks  and we also issued  in unsecured promissory notes to the penn crusher stockholders 
we borrowed  from a bank through k tron s us manufacturing subsidiary  which loan was combined with an outstanding term loan see existing debt below from that bank to that subsidiary 
monthly principal payments of  plus interest at a fixed rate of on approximately half the loan and at a variable rate of one month libor plus on the other half at december  began february  with the final principal payment of approximately  plus interest being due in january this loan is secured by substantially all of the assets of the us manufacturing subsidiary and is guaranteed by k tron international  inc penn crusher borrowed  from another us bank consisting of an aggregate of  term debt  with a five year term and  with a six year term and  under a five year revolving credit facility 
subject to certain conditions  the revolving credit facility provides for up to an additional  of availability 
quarterly term debt principal payments of  begin march  and increase each year by  per quarter or  per year in the aggregate through december   with final quarterly payments of  in interest is from one to six month libor plus to  and the to can be reduced to to upon meeting certain financial ratios 
in january  penn crusher entered into an interest rate swap related to the entire  five year term loan where interest will not exceed for the full term of the loan and can be reduced to upon meeting certain financial ratios 
the interest rates on the  million term loan and  revolving credit facility were and  respectively  as of january  the penn crusher debt is guaranteed by jeffrey and secured by substantially all of the assets of penn crusher and jeffrey  but it is not guaranteed by any other k tron company 
in addition  k tron issued  of unsecured promissory notes to the penn crusher stockholders as part of the penn crusher purchase price  which notes are payable in three equal  annual installments on the second  third and fourth anniversaries of the closing date 
interest at per annum is payable quarterly 
as stated previously  k tron and penn crusher are expected to have sufficient cash flow to cover all required principal and interest payments on the foregoing debt 
other debt on march   our us manufacturing subsidiary borrowed  under a term loan facility with a us bank  and we used these funds  together with  of available cash and a borrowing of  on a  revolving credit facility with the same bank  to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
the  term loan was originally payable in equal monthly installments of principal plus accrued interest over a four year period and was secured by liens on the same collateral which secures the revolving credit loan and also a separate mortgage loan from the same us bank 
one half of the term loan bore interest at the fixed rate of for the first two years and from february  until the refinancing of this loan on december  was subject to a variable rate of interest equal to one month libor plus percent at december   and the other half was subject to the same variable rate basis of interest equal to one month libor plus percent at december  
at december   there was  outstanding under this term loan 
on december   we refinanced the outstanding balance of this loan and borrowed an additional  to finance the january  acquisition of penn crusher  which refinancing was described above under recent developments 
both the original term loan facility and the refinanced facility require that we maintain certain specific ratios of consolidated debt to net worth and minimum annual debt coverage  and a minimum level of net worth  calculated at the end of each fiscal year 
in and  we were in compliance with these covenants 
at december   our swiss subsidiary had separate credit facilities totaling million swiss francs million with three swiss banks

in july  the annual interest rate was reduced to 
beginning august   the loan is repayable in eighty three monthly principal and interest payments of  with a final payment of  plus interest on august  at december   the remaining amount owed under this borrowing was  also in june  our us manufacturing subsidiary entered into a two year secured revolving credit facility with a us bank that provided for a maximum borrowing of  since reduced to  this facility has been extended through july at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under this line  and  was available for future borrowings 
the annual interest rate as of december  was

the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
judgments and estimates of uncertainties are required in applying the company s accounting policies in certain areas 
following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates determination of an asset s useful life  estimates of allowances for bad debts  cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  estimates of realizability of deferred tax assets  warranty cost  and legal contingencies 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
we base our critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates which we believe to be reasonable 
certain of the more critical assumptions include depreciable lives of plant and equipment changes in technology wear and tear changes in market demand bad debt risk credit worthiness of specific customers and aging of customer balances contractual rights and obligations general and specific economic conditions asset impairment determinations intended use of assets and expected future cash flows industry specific trends and economic conditions customer preferences and behavior patterns impact of regulatory initiatives deferred taxes expected future profitability and cash flows impact of regulatory initiatives timing of reversals of existing temporary differences between book and taxable income warranty cost new product introduction past experience legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions  or the effectiveness of our strategies  related to these proceedings

we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
a wide range of factors could materially affect our future performance and financial and competitive position  including the following i increasing price and product service competition by domestic and foreign competitors  including new entrants  ii the mix of products services sold by us  iii rapid technological changes and developments and our ability to continue to introduce competitive new products on a timely and cost effective basis  iv changes in us and global financial and currency markets  including significant interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  v protection and validity of patent and other intellectual property rights held by us and our competitors  vi the cyclical nature of our business as a capital goods supplier  vii possible future litigation and governmental proceedings  viii the availability of financing and financial resources in the amounts  at the times and on the terms required to support our future business  including capacity expansions and possible acquisitions  ix the loss of key customers  employees or suppliers  x the failure to carry out marketing and sales plans  xi the failure to integrate acquired businesses without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems  xii economic  business and regulatory conditions and changes which may affect the level of new investments and purchases made by customers  including general economic and business conditions that are less favorable than expected  xiii domestic and international political and economic conditions  and xiv the outcome of any legal proceedings in which we are involved
