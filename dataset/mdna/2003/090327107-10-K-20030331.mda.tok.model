item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
see business special note regarding forward looking statements contained elsewhere herein 
overview see the discussion above under item  general  for an overview of our business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
revenue recognition most of our revenues are from sales of licenses of our software and maintenance service agreements typically a one year term with the license purchase 
we also generate revenue from sales of consulting and training services 
our service revenue has increased in recent periods as the size of our installed base has grown 
we sell our products principally through both our direct sales force  which includes our direct sales and telesales personnel  as well as through indirect channels  such as distributors  vars and oems 
we follow american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition sop and statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  in accounting for revenues 
we primarily license our software products under perpetual licenses 
revenues are recognized under these arrangements once the following criteria are met i a written purchase order  license agreement or contract has been executed  ii software  or software license authorization code in situations where the customer previously received evaluation software  has been delivered to the customer  iii license agreements with no significant vendor obligations or customer acceptance rights outstanding have been issued to the customer  iv the license fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the fee is probable  and v vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price generally charged when an element is sold separately or the renewal rate for maintenance agreements in subsequent years 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence does not exist  and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  revenue is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement 
if installation is essential to the functionality of the software  revenue is deferred until completion of the installation 
certain of these items may require the application of judgment when evaluating specific business arrangements in a changing environment against our normal business practices 
revenues from maintenance contracts and other related services are reported as service revenue 
customers generally purchase a one year maintenance agreement in conjunction with their licensing of the company s software products and may elect to purchase multiple years of maintenance 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term 
the portion of maintenance contract revenues not yet recognized as revenues is reported as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred maintenance revenue does not include any amounts that have not been collected from customers 
in addition to deferred maintenance  deferred revenues include consulting and training services which have been billed but not performed and license contracts which did not meet the aforementioned revenue recognition criteria 
sales made through distributors  vars  and oems are recognized upon execution of a written purchase order  license agreement or contract with either the reseller or end user and after all revenue recognition criteria previously noted have been met 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations and assessments of the financial viability of our customers  including distributors  vars and oems  in determining whether or not collection of the fee is probable 
stock options we follow accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  in accounting for our employee stock options  which generally provides that no compensation expense is recognized when options are granted with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the date of the grant 
income taxes we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances may also be provided based upon subjective evaluations of facts  circumstances and expectations  which may change over the course of time and may result in significant changes in our tax provision 
accounts receivable and provision for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is considered doubtful 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  review our collection efforts and analyze our payment experience with specific customers in order to determine whether or not collection is doubtful 
there may be a significant fluctuation in our provision for doubtful accounts to the extent our subjective evaluation of the facts  circumstances and expectations change 
results of operations year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for were million compared with million in the year over year decline primarily related to the decrease in license sales of our products for novell platforms  partially offset by increased license sales of our products for microsoft platforms and higher services revenues 
license revenues for were million  or percent of total revenues  down from million in services revenues for were million  or percent of total revenues  up from million in during  revenues from our products for microsoft based platforms totaled million  an increase of percent over revenues from these products accounted for approximately percent of total revenues in  up from percent of total revenues for we expect revenues from our software products on microsoft based platforms will continue to grow as a percentage of total revenues 
revenues from our products for novell based platforms for the current year were million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million in  or percent of total revenues 
revenues from these products have been declining over the past year  reflecting both the maturity and our penetration of the novell market 
while we expect our novell revenues will continue to decline in the future  we expect that the rate of decline will be modest over the next few quarters and that the decline will be offset by revenue growth from our other product platforms 
sales of our security focused bv control product line accounted for approximately percent of our license revenue in compared with percent in sales of our system administration focused bv admin product line accounted for approximately percent of our license revenue in compared with percent in no customer accounted for more than percent of our revenues in and revenues recognized from sales to customers outside north america  primarily in europe  accounted for approximately percent of total revenues in compared with percent in gross profit 
gross profit for was million  compared with million for the decline in gross profit reflected the decrease in license revenues  partially offset by a slight improvement in gross margin 
the expansion in gross margin reflected the improvement in operating leverage of the company s technical support and professional services units 
gross margin for was percent  up from percent in operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses for totaled million  down from million for these costs include restructuring and asset impairment charges of million in and million in these charges related to restructuring plans to improve operating efficiency  improve sales and marketing effectiveness and accelerate our return to profitability 
excluding these charges  our operating costs and expenses were million lower in than the preceding year 
sales and marketing expenses for decreased percent to million  from million for  primarily related to actions taken to improve sales efficiency and marketing effectiveness 
these actions included a rationalization of our sales force and marketing programs relative to the market opportunity 
as a result  we closed or downsized a number of our foreign sales offices and reduced the size of our enterprise sales force  which were focused exclusively on large enterprise transactions 
we also redirected our marketing efforts on enhancing our product marketing capabilities and improving our sales opportunity generation capabilities 
we expect sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues to be lower in as a result of our initiatives to date to improve operating leverage and sales and marketing effectiveness and anticipated revenue growth 
research and development expenses for were million  down from million in this decrease primarily related to the closing or downsizing of our development offices in boston  massachusetts and arlington  virginia and transferring those activities to our lower cost development centers in houston  texas and pune  india 
we also transferred development responsibilities for certain of our legacy products from houston  texas to pune  india and expect to continue leveraging that development center in the future 
as a result of these initiatives and anticipated revenue growth  we expect future research and development expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative expenses for were million  down from million for this decrease primarily related to the reduction in administrative expenses related to our restructuring initiatives and higher provisions for consulting fees  sales tax accruals and bad debts in we expect future general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues as a result of our restructuring initiatives to date to improve operating efficiencies  as well as anticipated revenue growth 
restructuring costs were million in and million in the restructuring charge in included an upward adjustment of million in our accrual for leaseholds that were abandoned in primarily related to the deteriorating sublease commercial real estate market in houston  texas 
in july we approved a restructuring plan to improve operating efficiency and improve sales and marketing productivity 
the original estimate for the cost of this plan totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of i involuntary employee separation for approximately employees a reduction in workforce of approximately percent  ii closing the company s boston development center and certain european sales offices  iii reserves for leasehold abandonment  and iv various non personnel related cuts 
the costs of the plan were based on our best estimate utilizing information available at the time 
subsequent to recording the charge in september  we increased the amount of the charge by million due to lower expected sublease rental rates related to deterioration in the commercial real estate market in houston  texas  offset by lower costs associated with employee severance 
these changes are reflected below in the adjustments column and were included in the transaction and restructuring line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
the restructuring expenses and amounts charged against the provision as of december  were as follows in thousands cash remaining accrual at charges adjustments expenditures december  employee severance lease commitments other in connection with the restructuring plan  we also determined that certain leasehold improvements related to the downsized or closed offices were impaired and recognized an asset impairment of million 
in  we completed a corporate reorganization and implemented a number of cost cutting measures to improve operating efficiency and to accelerate our return to profitability 
the cost of this plan totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of i involuntary employee separation expenses for approximately employees a reduction in workforce of approximately percent  ii downsizing or closing of our boston and arlington development centers and certain of our european sales offices  iii reserves for leasehold abandonment  and iv various non personnel related costs 
the restructuring costs included a million charge related to asset impairments of leasehold improvements  equipment and other assets of the closed or downsized offices 
the costs of the plan were based on our best estimate utilizing information available at that time 
due to the economic downturn experienced in the commercial real estate market in houston  texas during  our estimates for sublease rentals were decreased 
this change is reflected in the adjustments column below and was recorded in the transaction and restructuring line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
the accrued restructuring expenses and amounts charged against the provision as of december  were as follows in thousands remaining remaining accrual at cash accrual at charges december  adjustments expenditures december  employee severance  lease commitments    office closure costs asset impairments  other restructuring costs separate from the restructuring charge  we also recognized in an asset impairment charge of million  relating to a million write off of software and computer equipment and a million impairment of certain intangible assets 
the majority of the software and computer equipment write off related to an enterprise wide asset management system acquired in that will not be installed or utilized in the future 
the intangible assets consisted primarily of customer lists and non compete agreements acquired in that were deemed to have no future value 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled million in and million in in  other income expense was primarily comprised of i the receipt of a million insurance settlement of a business interruption business claim made in and ii interest income of million 
in  other income expense was primarily comprised of i a write off of a million equity investment in a uk based software distribution and consulting firm and ii interest income of million 
the write off of the million equity investment was based on an independent appraisal of the current fair value of the investment and management s assessment of the value that would be derived from a future sale 
this software distribution and consulting firm has filed for bankruptcy in the uk in the year over year decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances in provision benefit for income taxes 
in  we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million in accordance with financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as in its prior assessments  we considered current and previous performance and other relevant factors in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowance 
objective factors  such as current and previous operating losses  were given substantially more weight than our outlook for future profitability 
we remain optimistic about the future prospects of our business and the industry and continue to believe that over time  as the market improves  we should generate sufficient taxable income to utilize a substantial portion of our net operating loss carryforwards 
until such time as a consistent pattern of sufficient profitability is established  no tax benefit will be recognized associated with our pre tax accounting losses and a full income tax provision will not be provided on any future pre tax accounting income 
net loss 
due to the factors described above  net loss for was million compared with million for outlook for our outlook for attempts to take into account the current uncertainty in market and economic conditions that may result from the risks and uncertainties set forth in the cautionary statements below as well as changes and investments in our sales and marketing strategies recently implemented 
we are investing in sales territories that have historically underperformed and which we expect to provide reasonable opportunities for growth in  specifically europe  latin america and federal government 
complementing these investments  we have restructured our go to market strategies to include a tiered sales focus on enterprise  named  and emerging accounts  and a consolidated business line approach to our bv admin  bv control and bindview policy center solutions including accountability for product line profitability  marketing and r d investments 
for  we expect revenues to equal or exceed million and have sized the organization to achieve profitability and positive cash flow at million in revenues 
our ability to achieve or exceed these estimates will depend on the level of it security spending for  as well as on our ability to execute our business plan  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so successfully 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  revenues 
revenues for were million compared with million in this year over year decline was primarily due to the global decline in it spending in  which adversely affected sales to large enterprise and european customers 
license revenues for were million  or percent of total revenues  down from million for service revenues in were million  or percent of total revenues  up from million in  reflecting an increase in our installed customer base and a higher focus on consulting services

gross profit for was million  compared with million for virtually all of the decline was due to the decrease in license revenues in gross margin for was percent  down from percent in  reflecting a shift in business mix toward services revenues  which have a lower gross margin than license revenues 
additionally  the cost of services has increased as a result of increases in the cost of technical support staff servicing our growing customer base and increases in the cost of professional services and training staff 
operating costs and expenses

the charges for were primarily merger and transaction costs related to the merger with entevo corporation and to a lesser extent costs associated with the closing of one of our product development offices 
excluding these charges  our operating costs and expenses were up million in primarily as a result of higher sales and marketing expenses related to infrastructure investments made in the second half of and carried through the first half of  as well as higher administrative expenses mainly related to an increase in our bad debt reserve 
sales and marketing expenses for increased percent to million  from million for primarily related to i building and maintaining an enterprise sales force focused exclusively on increasing sales to large enterprise customers and ii expanding our european sales offices 
these and other investments in sales and marketing added over million in quarterly sales expense in the fourth quarter of and the first two quarters of because of the difficult operating environment  these investments did not generate sufficient revenues to justify their cost and were significantly reduced as part of our restructuring that took place in mid as a result of this restructuring  we reduced our quarterly sales and marketing expenses to pre build up levels 
research and development expenses for were million  down from million in this decrease primarily related to the closing or downsizing of our development offices in boston  massachusetts and arlington  virginia and consolidating most of their development activities into existing development centers in houston  texas and pune  india 
general and administrative expenses for were million  up from million for this increase primarily related to i million in bad debt expense incurred during the second quarter of in connection with a review of our collections efforts and experience with specific customers as well as our overall customer base in light of the weaker economy and our decision to reposition the company in its market and to reposition various sales force deployments and ii an increased investment in administrative staff made during the first half of in  we completed a corporate reorganization and implemented a number of cost cutting measures to improve operating efficiency and to accelerate our return to profitability 
the cost of this plan totaled approximately million and consisted primarily of i involuntary employee separation expenses for approximately employees a reduction in workforce of approximately percent  ii downsizing or closing of our boston and arlington development centers and certain of our european sales offices  iii reserves for leasehold abandonment  and iv various non personnel related costs 
the restructuring costs included a million charge related to asset impairments of leasehold improvements  equipment and other assets of the closed or downsized offices 
the costs of the plan were based on our best estimate utilizing information available at that time 
due to the economic downturn experienced in the commercial real estate market in  our estimates for sublease rentals were decreased 
this change is reflected in the adjustments column below and was recorded in the transaction and restructuring line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss 
the accrued restructuring expenses and amounts charged against the provision as of december  were as follows in thousands remaining remaining accrual at cash accrual at charges december  adjustments expenditures december  employee severance  lease commitments    office closure costs asset impairments  other restructuring costs separate from the restructuring charge  we also recognized in an asset impairment charge of million  relating to a million write off of software and computer equipment and a million impairment of certain intangible assets 
the majority of the software and computer equipment write off related to an enterprise wide asset management system acquired in that will not be installed or utilized in the future 
the intangible assets consisted primarily of customer lists and non compete agreements acquired in that were deemed to have no future value 
during  we merged with entevo corporation in a stock for stock transaction accounted for as a pooling of interests 
transaction costs of million and restructuring costs of million were incurred in connection with the merger 
the transaction costs consisted of investment banking fees of million and professional fees and other miscellaneous expenses of million 
at the time of the merger  management approved restructuring plans to eliminate duplicate positions and integrate entevo s and our operations 
these restructuring costs consisted of employee severance and relocation costs of million and other miscellaneous integration and restructuring costs of million 
as of december   there were no actions remaining under the plan

in connection with this realignment  we determined certain capitalized software costs  prepaid royalties and equipment were impaired and recognized an asset impairment charge  which was included in operating costs and expenses  totaling million 
in connection with this corporate product realignment  we approved restructuring plans to eliminate certain positions and to close our operations in fremont  california 
these restructuring costs consisted of employee severance costs of million and other miscellaneous integration and restructuring costs of million 
as of december   there were no actions remaining under the plan 
other income expense 
other income expense totaled million in and million in the decline in other income was the result of i a write off of a million equity investment in a uk based software distribution and consulting firm and ii lower investment income due to lower interest rates and lower investment balances during the period 
the write off of the million equity investment was based on an independent appraisal of the current fair value of the investment and management s assessment of the value that would be derived from a future sale 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for was million an effective tax rate of percent  compared with million an effective tax rate of percent for our effective tax rate includes the effects of state and foreign income taxes and certain foreign losses for which no tax benefits have been provided  as well as the portion of entevo transaction costs incurred in which are not deductible for tax purposes 
this rate reflected management s expectation that the current year net operating losses nol would be realized by the company in its future federal income tax returns as a reduction of the future income tax payable prior to the expiration of the carryforward period 
as previously noted above  we subsequently provided for a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets during net loss 
due to the factors described above  net loss for was million compared with million for recent pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations be accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and changes the criteria for recognition of intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
the provisions of sfas no

sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  however  these assets must be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
the standard also establishes specific guidance for testing for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
amends existing accounting guidance on asset impairment and provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
among other provisions  the new rules change the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale 
the standard also broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations  and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for our fiscal year the interim disclosure requirements are effective for the second quarter of our fiscal year we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital requirements have principally related to working capital needs and capital expenditures 
these requirements have been met through a combination of issuances of securities and internally generated funds 
the company had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  compared with million at december  the major reasons for the decrease were the purchase of million shares of the company s common stock for million and capital expenditures of million 
this decrease was partially offset by cash flows from operating activities of million and million in proceeds primarily from the sale of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
cash flows provided by used in operating activities were million in and million in the increase in operating cash flows from operating activities reflected improvements in operating leverage and improvements in working capital management 
cash flows provided by investing activities were million in and million in the decrease in cash generated from investing activities related to a decrease in proceeds generated from the maturity of investments 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in and million in the major use of cash in financing activities in was for the repurchase of million shares of its common stock for million 
this use was partially offset by proceeds of million primarily from the sale of common stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
we conduct operations in leased facilities under operating leases expiring at various dates through the remaining contractual obligations under these lease commitments were comprised of the following as of december  contractual and obligation total beyond operating leases      sub leasing arrangements   we have sub leased portions of these facilities under operating leases 
anticipated cash receipts from these executed sub lease arrangements have been taken into account when deriving expected cash outflow on operating lease commitments in the preceding table 
our expected principal cash requirements for are i capital expenditures between million and million  primarily for computer and software equipment  ii to fund our working capital requirements  and iii payment of accrued restructuring expenses of approximately million and million 
we believe that there is sufficient cash on hand to meet these cash requirements  as well as our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
proprietary rights see the discussion below under the headings cautionary statements other companies might try to misappropriate our technology and cautionary statements we might be accused of misappropriating a third party s technology 
cautionary statements in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors in particular which are not listed in any particular order of importance should be carefully considered when you evaluate bindview and its business 
there may be other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  which could also impair our business operations 
as discussed in more detail below  if one or more of the following risks actually occur  it is possible our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
demand for our products may be weak in the current economy 
our product sales are significantly concentrated 
we may face future competition from established companies entering our market  and or from consolidated companies 
our products could be rendered obsolete by operating system and application program software vendors 
our product sales usually require long lead times 
our quarterly sales are significantly back end loaded  which can lead to uncertainty about meeting expectations and to lower sales prices 
our sales are somewhat seasonal 
our products may not be able to prevail in comparative evaluations against our competitors products 
recent refinements to our sales compensation structure have yet to be proved successful 
ongoing refinements to our sales organization may result in transitional inefficiencies 
we do not maintain a significant backlog 
our international sales are subject to certain additional risks 
we may be subject to foreign currency risks 
we are dependent upon continued growth of the market for windows system software 
we are likely to continue to be confronted by rapidly changing markets 
our r d efforts may not be sufficient to keep up with changing markets 
our software could contain errors that are hard to detect and costly to fix 
we could be subject to liability claims if our software has errors 
we rely on certain third party relationships  and our business could be hurt if those relationships were to be impaired 
we license certain third party software for inclusion in our product  and such software may not always be available for our use 
our revenue bases may change with the market 
we are affected by the migration rate to windows other companies might try to misappropriate our technology 
we might be accused of misappropriating a third party s technology 
our cost structure is fixed to a certain extent  which may limit our ability to reduce costs if sales decrease 
we may be required to defer increasing amounts of revenue in the future 
our stock price has a history of volatility 
the loss of one or more of our key individuals could hurt our business 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management team and board of directors 
our corporate governance structure includes certain anti takeover provisions 
our network and web site may be targeted for intentional disruption 
natural disasters and other infrastructure problems may hurt our ability to operate 
acquisitions may pose additional risks 
demand for our products may be weak in the current economy 
in the us economy was widely viewed as having entered a recession  which was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september in  a recovery was believed by some to have commenced  but the recovery may be delayed by the war recently begun in iraq 
in such a general economic downturn  our customers are apt to curtail it expenses 
this can result in lower sales  lower sales revenues and a lengthening of sales cycles during these periods 
the economy may go into a so called double dip recession 
even if the recession is ending  our customers it spending still may not increase immediately 
our product sales are significantly concentrated 
a majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of licenses and maintenance for our bv control software products 
we anticipate these products will account for a majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
if our bv control products become uncompetitive for any reason  our business could be substantially damaged 
although we currently plan to broaden our product line  we cannot be certain we will be able to reduce our product concentration 
we may face future competition from established companies entering our market  and or from consolidated companies 
we expect competition in our market to increase significantly as current competitors expand their product lines and services and as new companies enter the market 
many of these existing and potential competitors are likely to enjoy substantial competitive advantages  including greater resources that can be devoted to the development  promotion and sale of their products  more established sales channels  greater software development experience  and greater name recognition 
in addition  we have noted what appears to be a recent trend of consolidation in our market through mergers and acquisitions 
for example  symantec corporation acquired axent technologies and thereby began competing with us in one area of our market 
other examples from recent years include quest software s acquisition of fastlane technologies inc and netiq corporation s mergers with mission critical software and pentasafe  inc this could result in the creation of new competitors and or enhancement of the competitive capabilities of existing competitors 
if these present and future competitors are successful  we are likely to lose market share and our revenue would likely decline 
our products could be rendered obsolete by operating system and application program software vendors 
we believe vendors of operating system and application program software we support  particularly microsoft and novell  could enhance their software to include functionality we provide in our own software 
microsoft has a well established track record of successfully entering and competing in markets in which it becomes interested  in recent years  microsoft has publicly announced it intends to focus more intensely on computer and internet related security issues 
if such other vendors were to offer greater functionality than they currently do  then even if our software were clearly better  there would still be a substantial risk many customers would elect to use good enough functionality in the operating system or application program software instead of buying and or continuing to pay maintenance fees for our software 
if this risk were to come to pass  our license and maintenance revenues could be seriously affected 
our product sales usually require long lead times 
the sales cycles for our products are typically long 
the extended sales cycles are due to a variety of reasons  including but not necessarily limited to the following 
our customers must complete their own internal evaluation and budget approval procedures 
because our software is used in network management  customers often require that several people evaluate the software 
sometimes such people are in different functional and geographic areas and may have different and perhaps conflicting requirements  this can increase the time needed for customer evaluation 
in addition  we have recently expanded our product offerings and have been working to sell more enterprise wide licenses involving multiple bindview products  this likewise can increase time required for customer review 
some customers intentionally delay purchases for reasons such as budgetary constraints  concerns about the general economy  or a desire to wait until new products are announced  either by us  by our competitors  or by underlying infrastructure vendors such as microsoft or novell 
moreover  in recent quarters we have experienced longer budget and purchasing review cycles from some of our customers as a result of the us economic slowdown 
our quarterly sales are significantly back end loaded  which can lead to uncertainty about meeting expectations and to lower sales prices 
we generally record a significant portion of our revenues near the end of each fiscal quarter  due in part to customer buying patterns 
many companies negotiate large purchase agreements near the end of the quarter 
we believe these companies expect that by doing so  they can negotiate lower prices and better terms at a time when publicly traded vendors are conscious of the need to make their numbers for the quarter 
in any given quarter  such customer behavior can make it difficult for us to forecast our ability to meet the expectations of investors and analysts 
we may make some end of quarter sales at lower prices than originally offered  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
our sales are somewhat seasonal 
our customers sometimes make significant license and maintenance purchases at the end of the year  possibly because they have budget dollars left and wish to spend those dollars rather than lose them 
in addition  some of our sales compensation policies are based on achievement of certain annual revenue goals 
as a result  our fourth quarter has historically tended to be the strongest in sales  which in turn has meant the following first quarter is often weaker in sales 
our first quarter sales in any given fiscal year do not necessarily indicate we will achieve higher sales in any subsequent quarter 
our products may not be able to prevail in comparative evaluations against our competitors products 
our customers often conduct beauty contests in which they evaluate not only our products but those of our competitors 
we believe our products usually fare very well in such head to head contests  but the possibility always exists that we may lose any given such contest for one or more reasons  some of which may be beyond our control 
for example  if our product does not have a certain functionality that is particularly important to a customer  and if a competitor s product does have such functionality  then we may not be able to win that customer s business 
recent refinements to our sales compensation structure have yet to be proved successful 
we recently made changes to our sales compensation structure based on the recommendation of a consulting firm that studied our sales operations 
we expect these changes will result in more closely aligning the personal financial interests of our sales force with the financial interests of the company  but if not  our business could be adversely affected 
ongoing refinements to our sales organization may result in transitional inefficiencies 
we are currently refining our sales organization to increase our ability to support enterprise wide sales 
some of these refinements may require additional training for some of our sales personnel whose job duties are changed  which can result in temporary inefficiencies as these personnel learn their new duties 
we do not maintain a significant backlog 
we normally do not operate with a backlog because we ship our products shortly after orders are received 
consequently  if new orders dry up  we will not be able to cushion the resulting lack of sales with backlog sales 
our international sales are subject to certain additional risks 
during   and  we derived approximately percent  percent  and percent of our revenues  respectively  from sales outside north america  both with our own international sales force who generally are employed by our foreign subsidiaries and by resellers and distributors 
we cannot be certain we will be able to attract third parties that will be able to market our products effectively or to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
our reseller arrangements generally provide that resellers may carry competing product offerings 
we cannot be certain any distributor or reseller will continue to represent our products 
if we are unable to recruit or retain sales personnel  distributors  or resellers  that inability could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to generate increased sales using our international sales force  our costs will be higher without corresponding increases in revenue  resulting in lower operating margins for our international operations 
in addition  employment law and policies vary among countries outside the united states  which may reduce our flexibility in managing headcount and  in turn  managing personnel related expenses 
if we do not address the risks associated with international sales in a cost effective and timely manner  our international sales growth will be limited  operating margins could be reduced and our business could be materially adversely affected 
even if we are able to successfully expand our international operations  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or increase international market demand for our products 
we may be subject to foreign currency risks 
to an increasing extent  our international business likely will be conducted in foreign currencies  especially the euro 
the exchange ratio of foreign currencies for us dollars has fluctuated in the past and is likely to do so in the future  but we cannot predict the extent to which this will happen 
such fluctuations may lead to our experiencing currency losses 
we have not adopted a formal hedging program to protect us from risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
we are dependent upon continued growth of the market for windows system software 
we depend upon the success of microsoft s windows nt and windows operating systems  and to a lesser extent on the success of novell s netware operating system and of microsoft s exchange software 
in particular  market acceptance of our products depends on the increasing complexity of these software products and the advantages that our own software provides in managing those products 
there may be times when the growth of one or more of these software products flattens out or even declines  especially if it spending becomes  or stays  generally flat 
to a certain extent  the growth in the windows system software products comes at the expense of the corresponding novell products  meaning that even if we gain customers on the windows side  we may lose customers on the novell side 
we are likely to continue to be confronted by rapidly changing markets 
the markets in which we do business can often be subject to rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands  and evolving industry standards 
our products could be rendered obsolete if new products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to react to  and ideally to anticipate  these changes 
our r d efforts may not be sufficient to keep up with changing markets 
to deal successfully with market changes  we must periodically enhance our existing products  develop and introduce new products  and sometimes discontinue an existing product 
our products are inherently complex  as a result  our new products and product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
when we undertake a project along these lines  we must make resource investments that often are significant in scope 
we may experience various delays and other difficulties in any given project  if that happens  it increases the chances that a competitor might beat us to the market and thereby achieve a potential first to market advantage  this in turn could hinder our efforts to persuade customers to buy our products  which could damage our business 
we have  on occasion  experienced delays in our planned introduction of new or enhanced products and cannot be sure such delays will not occur again 
in short  we cannot be certain  as our market evolves  we will be able to introduce new and or updated products customers will want to buy or continue to use  or if we do  that we will earn enough money to recoup or realize a return on our investments 
our software could contain errors that are hard to detect and costly to fix 
our software products are complex and usually are installed and used in large computer networks having a wide variety of equipment and networking configurations 
we try to test our new products and product enhancements thoroughly and to work with customers through our customer support services organization to identify and correct errors bugs 
even so  we might first become aware of a particular error in a product or product enhancement only after we had released it for general licensing availability 
depending on severity  such errors could cost us substantial time and money to fix  possibly delaying our work on other new products or product enhancements 
in addition  such errors could damage our reputation  possibly hurting our ability to sell not only the product or product enhancement in question but perhaps other products as well 
moreover  the operating system or applicable program software with which our products operate could itself have bugs  this could result in problems being incorrectly blamed on our software  which in turn could result in our having to spend time and money addressing the problems even though they ultimately proved not to have been of our making 
we could be subject to liability claims if our software has errors 
conceivably  errors in our software could lead to warranty claims and or to product liability claims 
such claims could require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
most of our license agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims  but it is possible that these provisions may not prove effective in limiting our liability 
any such claims  whether or not ultimately successful  could damage our reputation and our business 
we rely on certain third party relationships  and our business could be hurt if those relationships were to be impaired 
we rely to a considerable extent on our relationships with microsoft and novell  for example  we attempt to coordinate our product offerings with the future releases of their operating systems 
these companies may not notify us of feature enhancements prior to new releases of their operating systems in the future 
if that were to happen  we might not be able to introduce new products and product enhancements on a timely basis to capitalize on other companies new releases and feature enhancements 
this could lead to one or more competitors  having better relationships with these companies  pulling ahead of us in the marketplace 
we license certain third party software for inclusion in our product  and such software may not always be available for our use 
we license certain third party software to perform certain functions in certain of our own software products 
so far we have been able to renew the required licenses on terms we regard as satisfactory 
it is possible that in the future we may not be able to renew one or more of those licenses on acceptable terms 
if that were to occur  we might be forced to stop shipping the affected product s until we could find or build a replacement for the third party software  this could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our revenue bases may change with the market 
the percentages of our revenues attributable to software licenses for particular operating system or application software platforms can change from time to time 
a number of factors outside our control can cause these changes  including changing market acceptance and penetration of the various operating system and application software platforms we support and the relative mix of development and installation by vars of application software operating on such platforms 
we are affected by the migration rate to windows our ability to sell licenses for some of our bv admin migration products depends in part on the rate at which customers elect to migrate their networks to microsoft s windows operating system 
some observers have noted this migration rate has been slower than expected 
if the migration rate continues to remain comparatively slow  it could materially and adversely affect our revenues from such migration products 
other companies might try to misappropriate our technology 
we attempt to protect our technology with a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
we license our software products primarily under click wrap licenses agreements 
we believe  however  these measures afford only limited protection 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information we regard as proprietary 
we have found historically that a few customers use our software for more than they have paid for  representing a loss of revenue for us 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states  and we may be subject to unauthorized use of our products in those countries 
any legal action that we may bring to protect proprietary information could be expensive and may distract management from day to day operations 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect our products and technology from unauthorized copying 
in addition  competitors may be able to independently develop similar or superior technology 
we might be accused of misappropriating a third party s technology 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights is not uncommon in the software industry 
we expect software product developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
we are not aware that we are infringing any proprietary rights of third parties 
from time to time  however  third parties may claim we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  could result in costly litigation  could divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays  or could require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if a third party alleges we have infringed its intellectual property rights  we may choose to litigate the claim and or seek an appropriate license from the third party 
the mere fact a third party makes such an allegation could damage our reputation and hurt our ability to sell our products  and we might have little or no practical recourse even if the allegation is baseless 
if someone were successfully to make a claim of infringement against us  and if we could not or did not obtain a license or develop alternative technology on a timely basis  our business could be materially adversely affected 
our cost structure is fixed to a certain extent  which may limit our ability to reduce costs if sales decrease 
we base our expenses to a significant extent on our estimates of future sales revenues 
as a result  many of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
if our future sales do not match our estimates  we might embark on certain cost cutting measures which could include but are not limited to employee reductions  office closings and product consolidations  but we might not be able to cut costs quickly and effectively enough to prevent our business from being adversely affected 
we may be required to defer increasing amounts of revenue in the future 
as our sales transactions and product mix becomes more complex  revenue recognition principles stated in sop or sop could require us to defer a significant portion of our transaction revenues and to recognize the deferred revenue in future periods  rather than in the period in which the sales transactions occurred 
our stock price has a history of volatility 
there have been times when the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile like that of many other technology companies 
we expect our stock price will continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to our company  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  to the relatively low volume of trading in our common stock in recent months  or to factors affecting the computer industry or the securities markets in general 
we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year financial comparisons are not necessarily meaningful indicators of our future operating results and should not be relied on as an indication of future performance  nevertheless  if our quarterly and annual operating results should fail to meet market expectations  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively impacted 
our quarterly and annual operating results have varied substantially in the past and may vary substantially in the future due to a number of factors described elsewhere in this report  which could lead to significant changes in our stock price 
the loss of one or more of our key individuals could hurt our business 
if a senior executive or other key employee leaves the company  dies  or becomes disabled  that could hurt our business  especially if he or she joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us 
we have employment agreements and or change of control agreements with most of our senior executives 
these agreements establish an at will employment relationship  they do not require the executives to work for us for any particular period of time 
these agreements include provisions restricting the use of our confidential information and  in most cases  requiring the senior executive not to compete with us for specified periods of time  but enforcement of such agreements is generally time consuming  expensive  and uncertain in result especially so in the case of covenants not to compete 
we do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our personnel 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management team and board of directors 
several of our senior executives and members of our board of directors are comparatively new with the company 
our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to assimilate these changes in our leadership team 
our corporate governance structure includes certain anti takeover provisions 
certain aspects of our corporate governance structure  like that of many other technology companies  are typically regarded as anti takeover provisions 
such provisions likely would make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of our company  even if the change in control might be beneficial to our stockholders 
this could discourage potential takeover attempts and could hurt the market price of our common stock 
our network and web site may be targeted for intentional disruption 
as a leading provider of security related software  we anticipate that  from time to time  our corporate computer network and our web site may be targeted for intentional disruption by black hat hackers 
we believe we have taken sufficient precautions to prevent such disruption  but we cannot be certain we will succeed in preventing all such disruption 
if such disruption is successful  it could hurt our business activities  if successful disruption becomes publicly known  it could also damage our reputation and that of our products and services 
natural disasters and other infrastructure problems may hurt our ability to operate 
in june  tropical storm alison caused massive flooding throughout the houston area 
while our houston offices were not significantly damaged  the infrastructure of the building in which our offices were located was severely damaged by the flooding 
as a result  we were unable to occupy our offices for several weeks and were required to operate from temporary offices with temporary phone systems  computer network facilities  etc 
these events highlighted our reliance on our telephone system  computer network  and data center infrastructure for internal communications  communications with customers and partners  direct sales of our software products  sales lead generation  and direct provision of fee based services 
those systems may be vulnerable to damage from human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss and other facility failures  fire  flood  telecommunications failure  sabotage  terrorist attacks  vandalism and similar events 
despite precautions  a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems could result in interruptions in our service or significant damage 
in addition  failure of any of our telecommunications providers to provide consistent data communications capacity could result in interruptions in our services and thus in our ability to provide service to our customers 
acquisitions may pose additional risks 
in the past we have made  and we may continue to make  investments in complementary companies  technologies  services or products if we find appropriate opportunities 
if we were to buy a company  we could have difficulty assimilating the personnel and operations of the acquired company 
if we were to make other types of acquisitions  assimilating the technology  services or products into our operations could be difficult 
acquisitions could disrupt our ongoing business  distract management and other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures 
we might not succeed in overcoming these risks or in any other problems we might encounter in connection with any future acquisitions 
we cannot be certain we would be able to successfully integrate acquired products and technology into our sales model or product offerings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and changes in the market value of its investments 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
see business special note regarding forward looking statements contained elsewhere herein 
foreign currency exchange rates we operate globally and the functional currency for most of our non us enterprises is the local currency 
for the years ended december   and  approximately percent  percent and percent of our consolidated revenues  respectively  were generated from customers outside of north america  substantially all of which were billed and collected in foreign currencies 
similarly  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our foreign currency exchange instruments outstanding at december   we estimate a near term change in foreign currency rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  we used a value at risk var model to measure potential fair value losses due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur 
interest rate risk we adhere to a conservative investment policy  whereby our principal concern is the preservation of liquid funds while maximizing our yield on liquid assets 
cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments including restricted cash approximated million and million at december  and  respectively 
such amounts were invested in different types of investment grade securities with the intent of holding these securities to maturity 
although our portfolio is subject to fluctuations in interest rates and market conditions  no gain or loss on any security would actually be recognized in earnings unless the instrument was sold 
we estimate that a near term change in interest rates would not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows for the year ended december  we used a var model to measure potential market risk on our marketable securities due to interest rate fluctuations 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
the var model is a risk estimation tool  and as such  is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we will incur
