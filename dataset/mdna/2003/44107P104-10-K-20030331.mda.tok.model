item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion includes forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements and as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview host marriott corporation  a maryland corporation  is the owner of hotel properties  which operate primarily in the luxury and upper upscale hotel segments 
we conduct our operations as an umbrella partnership reit through our direct and indirect subsidiaries  including host marriott  lp  a delaware limited partnership of which we are the sole general partner and hold approximately of the partnership interests 
as of february  the national association of real estate investment trust ranks us as the largest lodging reit 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry including marriott  ritz carlton  four seasons  hilton and hyatt 
our properties are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort convention locations 
our portfolio depends on revenue from large and small group business  business travel  as well as leisure and discount travelers 
the target profile of our portfolio includes upper upscale and luxury properties in hard to duplicate locations that may allow us to maintain room rate and occupancy premiums over our competitors 
we seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management  by directing the managers of our hotels to reduce operating costs and increase revenues and by completing selective capital improvements 
our hotel sales traditionally experienced moderate seasonality 
additionally  hotel revenues in the fourth quarter typically reflect a greater proportion of our annual revenues than each of the prior quarters because our fourth quarter reflects sixteen weeks of results compared to twelve weeks for the first three quarters of the fiscal year 
see business and properties seasonality 
our results of operations primarily represent hotel level sales  which are room  food and beverage and other ancillary income such as telephone  parking and other guest services 
operating expenses consist of the costs to provide these services as well as depreciation  management fees  real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent  property insurance  income taxes of our consolidated taxable reit subsidiaries and other costs 
the operating environment during presented many challenges and was influenced significantly by reduced airline travel  weak economic conditions and general international unrest as a result of the threat of further terrorist activity and the potential for war in the middle east 
as a result  the lodging industry and our company experienced significant declines in revenues and operating profits because of reduced demand and rising operating expenses  including increased insurance costs 
we expect these conditions to persist into we are expecting revpar in to be generally comparable to levels or modestly lower  though revpar is likely to decline in the first half of we also expect continuing pressure on operating margins as we expect that certain important components of our operating costs  such as wages  benefits and insurance  will increase at a rate greater than estimated inflation in thus  operating profits and margins for will likely be below levels  especially if economic conditions do not improve 
we have a significant fixed cost component and expenses associated with owning and operating hotels  which do not necessarily decrease when circumstances such as market factors cause a reduction in revenue for the property 
as a result  changes in revpar can result in a greater percentage change in our earnings and cash flows 
in response to the decline in the operations of our hotels in and  we have been working with our hotel managers to achieve cost reductions at the properties  and we believe that these efforts have slowed the decrease in our operating margins 
although some of these cost savings may not be permanent  we believe that we have achieved some meaningful long term efficiencies 
in the future  margin improvement will generally be dependent upon revenue growth as additional cost reductions may be difficult to obtain and  as noted above  we expect that certain of our costs will increase at a rate greater than inflation in as of december   we were under the to ebitda to cash interest coverage ratio required under the senior notes indenture 
as a result  dividends on both common and preferred shares were restricted to the minimum amount of distributions required to maintain our reit status 
required distributions for were satisfied in part by payment of dividends on the preferred shares in we believe that the remaining distribution requirement should largely be satisfied by the payment of dividends expected to be declared on preferred shares in the first  second and third quarters of we may  however  also need to pay a nominal common dividend in to the extent necessary to satisfy any remaining distribution requirement 
the payment of any additional dividends on either common or preferred shares will depend on operating performance and its impact on taxable income and whether our ebitda to cash interest coverage ratio is at least to coverage for results of operations beginning january   we reported gross property level sales from the majority of our hotels  and our expenses included all property level costs including depreciation  management fees  real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent  property insurance and other costs 
our revenues for represent rental income on leases of our hotels 
expenses during represent specific owner costs  including real estate and property taxes  property insurance and ground and equipment rent 
as a result  our and results are not comparable to the historical reported amounts for compared to revenues 
hotel sales declined million  or  to approximately  million for from  million in the million decrease in hotel sales for primarily reflects the decrease in revpar for our properties of to 
while the decrease in revpar is due in part to the reduction in business and leisure travel  it is also the result of the change in business mix at our properties 
transient business  which includes the corporate and premium business segments  which generally pay the highest average room rates  has decreased by over since as a percentage of room sales 
our managers have partially offset this decline with additional group and contract business and other segments that have lower average room rates 
as a result  while occupancy has increased slightly  the average room rate has declined significantly 
we believe these trends will continue to affect our operations until the economy strengthens and business travel increases 
rental income decreased million  or  to million for from million in rental income for and includes lease income from our limited service hotel leases of million and million  respectively  lease income from full service hotel leases of million and million  respectively  and office space rental income of million for both years 
we repurchased the lessee entities with respect to four of the remaining five full service hotels leased to third parties effective june  and terminated those leases for financial reporting purposes 
as a result  we currently record rental income with respect to only one full service hotel 
operating costs and expenses 
operating costs and expenses decreased million  or  to  million in compared to this decrease is primarily the result of our efforts and those of our managers to control operating costs at the hotels and the overall decline in occupancy 
however  overall our comparable hotel operating profit margin decreased percentage points 
rental expense during and for our limited service hotel leases was million and million  respectively  and office space expense was million for both periods 
these expenses are included in other property level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
as previously discussed  we believe that operating margins will likely decline in as a result of total costs increasing at a rate greater than total revenues 
in particular  we expect that costs such as wages  benefits and insurance will increase at a rate greater than inflation 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses decreased by million  or  to million in compared to the decrease in expenses was principally due to a decrease in stock based compensation 
we have stock based compensation plans under which we may award to participating employees options to purchase shares of our common stock  deferred shares of our common stock or restricted shares of our common stock as well as an employee stock purchase plan 
the restricted shares issued to certain officers and key executives vest over a three year period in annual installments based on continued employment and the attainment of performance criteria established by our compensation policy committee 
these shares are subject to market adjustments that result in compensation expense benefit on a quarterly basis 
as a result of the decline in our stock price and our operations in  certain performance thresholds were not met  and a portion of these shares previously granted were forfeited  resulting in the reversal of expense previously recognized and a reduction in overall expenses 
minority interest expense 
for and  we recognized minority interest expense of million and million  respectively 
the variance is primarily due to the decline in our results of operations over the course of discontinued operations 
during january  we transferred the st 
louis marriott pavilion to the mortgage lender in a non cash transaction 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which we adopted january   we classified the hotel s operating results as discontinued operations in all periods presented 
as a result  at december  and  we recorded income  net of taxes  of million and a loss of million  respectively  as discontinued operations 
extraordinary gain 
during  we recorded an extraordinary gain  net of tax  of million  representing the extinguishment of debt on the st 
louis marriott pavilion 
during  we recorded an extraordinary loss  net of tax  of million representing the write off of deferred financing costs and certain fees paid to our lender in connection with renegotiations of the credit facility  as well as the refinancing of the mortgage debt on our canadian properties 
compared to revenues 
as discussed above  our revenues and operating profit for are not comparable to  due to our acquisition of the lessee entities by our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary 
the table below presents gross hotel sales for the years ended december  and for  gross hotel sales were used as the basis for calculating rental income 
the data is presented in order to facilitate an investor s understanding and comparative analysis of the operations of our properties and does not represent our revenues for these periods 
year ended december  december  in millions hotel sales rooms food and beverage other total hotel sales the million decrease in hotel sales for primarily reflects the decrease in revpar for our properties of to 
room sales also declined as a result of the loss of sales from the new york marriott world trade center and the new york marriott financial center due to the terrorist acts of september  the declines were partially offset by incremental revenues provided by the room expansion at the orlando marriott  which was placed in service in june  and the addition of three hotels as a result of our consolidation of rockledge hotel properties  inc rockledge and fernwood hotel assets  inc fernwood as of march  the decline in revpar during was generally due to a decrease in occupancy of percentage points and a decrease in room rates for the year 
as a result of decreased hotel sales  we directed our managers to implement cost cutting measures and revenue enhancement programs at the property level during the second quarter in order to stabilize operating profit margins 
these measures included increasing labor efficiency  particularly at the managerial level and in the food and beverage area at the hotels  reducing discretionary expenses in rooms  food and beverage  and repairs and maintenance and reducing energy consumption 
while we believe these measures were moderately successful  profit margins on our portfolio of hotels still decreased percentage points for corporate expenses 
corporate expenses decreased by million  or  as a result of corporate cost cutting during and a decrease of million in compensation expense related to employee stock plans 
lease repurchase expense 
in connection with the definitive agreement with crestline in november for the purchase of the leasehold interests with respect to hotels  we recorded a nonrecurring loss provision of million 
in  as a result of the purchase of four additional leasehold interests  we recognized a loss of million 
minority interest expense 
for and  we recognized minority interest expense of million and million  respectively 
the variance is primarily due to the decrease in the minority interest ownership of the operating partnership from at december  to at december  the decline is also a reflection of the decrease in our results of operations 
equity in earnings of affiliates 
equity in earnings of affiliates decreased million  or  to million for the decrease is principally due to the acquisition and consolidation of rockledge and fernwood on march  provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of million  a change of million  from the million income tax benefit in the change is primarily due to the million benefit taken during due to the recognition of the income tax asset as a result of the purchase of the leasehold interests with respect to hotels 
also  during and  we favorably resolved certain tax matters and recognized million and million  respectively  related thereto as a benefit to our tax provision 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash are cash from operations  the sale of assets  borrowings under our credit facility and our ability to obtain additional financing through various financial markets 
our principal uses of cash are for payments of debt  capital expenditures  asset acquisitions  operating costs  corporate expenses and distributions to our equity holders and minority owners of the operating partnership 
we believe our sources of cash will be sufficient to meet our current liquidity needs 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  which was an increase of million over our december  balance 
in addition  we have million of restricted cash as a result of lender and management agreement restrictions 
additionally  approximately million of our available cash and cash equivalents is held by our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
the distribution of this cash to the operating partnership could  under certain circumstances  increase our current or future income tax expense and or the amounts we are required to distribute to maintain our status as a reit 
on july   we completed the renegotiation of the management and other agreements on of our marriott and ritz carlton branded hotels  providing us with expanded approval rights over operating and capital budgets 
in addition to these modifications  we expanded the pool of hotels subject to an existing agreement that allows us to sell assets unencumbered by a marriott management agreement without the payment of termination fees 
the revised pool includes assets  measured by ebitda of which may be sold over approximately a ten year or greater period and measured by ebitda of which may be sold unencumbered by the marriott brand 
these changes were effective as of december  we have also completed the renegotiation of the management agreements on our four swiss tel management contracts  and have the ability to terminate two management agreements immediately and the remaining two over the next five years 
we believe that the modifications to the swiss tel agreements together with our revised agreements with marriott international will enhance our ability to dispose of our non core assets more efficiently 
as part of the renegotiation with marriott international  we also reduced the amount of working capital required and expanded an existing agreement that allowed us to fund furniture  fixtures and equipment expenditures as incurred from one account that we control rather than depositing funds into individual escrow accounts for each hotel 
as a result  an additional million in cash became available for our general use effective july  at that time  approximately million of funds returned to us were previously held in furniture  fixtures and equipment escrows to fund capital expenditures 
while we continue to be obligated to fund capital expenditures as such expenditures are approved by us  this modification has enabled us to use the available funds for general corporate purposes 
we will continue to maintain higher than normal cash balances in because we believe that the war in iraq could adversely affect the economy and in particular the lodging industry  which would result in further decline in our operations 
we believe that increased operating performance levels  specifically increased levels of business travel demand  would signal an opportunity to lower our cash balances through debt prepayments or asset acquisitions 
while we currently have million of availability under our credit facility and have no amounts outstanding thereunder  our forecast of operations indicates that we may fail to meet certain maintenance covenants for the credit facility during the second quarter of as a result  we expect to modify our financial covenants in the credit facility 
approximately million of our mortgage debt matures  and million of regularly scheduled amortization on our mortgage debt occurs  prior to we have no other significant refinancing requirements until we remain interested in pursuing single asset and portfolio acquisitions and have discussed the possibility of these transactions with several interested parties 
we believe there will be opportunities over the next several years to acquire assets that are consistent with our target profile of upper upscale and luxury properties in hard to duplicate urban  convention and resort locations 
however  we cannot be certain as to the size or timing of acquisition opportunities or of our ability to obtain transaction financing 
we will continue to pursue opportunities to dispose of non core assets that are not consistent with our portfolio strategy 
during  we expect to continue to have discussions with potential buyers for certain of our non core hotels 
we believe that  if consummated  sales of non core properties transactions could result in net proceeds of between million to million 
we intend to use the proceeds from dispositions to repay debt  though we could also elect to invest in our current portfolio or to acquire additional hotels 
however  there can be no assurance that these dispositions will occur 
cash provided by operations 
during  our cash provided by operations increased by million when compared to the increase over the prior year is partly due to an agreement we negotiated with marriott international under which million in cash became available to us because of a reduction in working capital requirements under our revised management agreements and the use of million of operating cash in for the purchase of the lessee interests previously leased to crestline 
the overall increase in cash provided by operations was partially offset by the declining operating results at the hotels during cash used in investing activities 
based on our assessment of the current operating environment and to conserve capital  we continued our disciplined approach to capital expenditures during as a result  renewal and replacement capital expenditures at our properties have decreased by approximately million  or  when compared to the same period in despite these decreases  we have focused on property maintenance and selected improvements designed to maintain appropriate levels of quality 
as a result of the changes in our agreements with marriott international  approximately million of funds previously held in escrow accounts for capital expenditures at certain properties has been returned to us 
on june   we acquired the boston marriott copley place in boston  massachusetts for a purchase price of million  which included the assumption of million of mortgage debt 
we completed the sale of the ontario airport marriott on january  for million to the westbrook fund iv acquisitions  llc 
we used the proceeds of this sale to retire certain of our debt 
the following table summarizes significant investing activities which were completed during the first quarter of and for the years and in millions transaction date description of transaction sale investment price january sale of ontario airport marriott june purchase of the  room boston marriott copley place january development of the room golf lodge at the ritz carlton  naples december sale of vail marriott mountain resort and the pittsburgh city center june addition of a spa facility at the marriott harbor beach resort june purchase of minority ownership interest april addition of a spa facility at the ritz carlton  naples march purchase of of the voting interest in rockledge and fernwood the limited partner interests relate to seven full service hotels 
the voting interests were previously held by the host marriott statutory employee charitable trust 
prior to the acquisition  we held a non voting interest in each company 
as a result of the acquisition  we consolidated three full service hotels  one of which was transferred to the lender in cash used in financing activities 
during  the cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of principal repayments on debt of million and preferred stock dividend payments of million 
on december   we announced that our board of directors had declared a dividend of per share of preferred stock  which was paid on january  to shareholders of record on december  we did not declare a dividend on our common stock during we are aware that certain of our outstanding senior notes are currently trading at a discount to their respective face amounts 
to reduce future cash interest payments  as well as future amounts due at maturity or upon redemption  we may from time to time purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or by conducting a tender offer 
our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our senior notes from the proceeds of any dispositions 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
during march  we purchased million of our senior notes at par 
the following table summarizes significant financing activity  except for the credit facility  payment of dividends  and non cash equity transactions all of which are discussed below  during the first quarter of and for the years  and in millions transaction date description of transaction transaction amount march retired a portion of senior notes in january partial prepayment of ritz carlton  naples and buckhead mortgage loan september retired senior notes due in january purchase of interest rate cap december issuance of series h senior notes october retired san antonio marriott riverwalk mortgage loan august proceeds from the canadian mortgage loan august retired ritz carlton  amelia island mortgage loan march issuance of class c cumulative redeemable preferred stock we retired the remaining million of these senior notes at approximately of par 
we recorded a nominal loss on the retirement 
this agreement caps the floating interest rate at for the swap agreement for the series i senior notes 
proceeds from the series h senior notes were used to repay the outstanding balance on the credit facility 
additionally  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with regards to this principal balance  as discussed below 
these notes were exchanged in june for series i senior notes on a one for one basis and are substantially identical to the series h senior notes and are freely transferable by the holders 
a canadian subsidiary entered into a financing agreement pursuant to which it borrowed million 
the calgary marriott  toronto airport marriott  toronto marriott eaton centre and toronto delta meadowvale hotels serve as collateral 
the proceeds from this financing were used to refinance existing indebtedness on these hotels  as well as to repay the million mortgage note on the ritz carlton  amelia island hotel 
on march   we issued approximately million shares of class c cumulative redeemable preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
holders of the class c preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions at a rate of per year of the per unit liquidation preference 
debt 
as of december   our total consolidated debt was approximately billion 
we have million in principal amortization and debt maturities due during and billion in principal amortization and debt maturities due over the next five years 
the weighted average interest rate of all our debt is approximately and our current average maturity is years 
additionally  of our debt has a fixed rate of interest as of december  over time  we expect to increase the proportion of floating rate debt in our capital structure to to of our total debt  although there can be no assurances that we will be able to achieve this result on terms acceptable to us 
in december  in order to take advantage of low  short term interest rates  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement described in derivative instruments to convert the fixed rate of the series h senior notes  which were subsequently exchanged into series i senior notes  to a floating rate 
in january  we entered into a separate cap arrangement to limit our exposure to interest rate increases on this floating rate swap described in derivative instruments 
we continue to evaluate our mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt and  to the extent we deem it appropriate  we may enter into additional interest rate swap agreements related to some of our fixed rate debt 
in march  we purchased million of senior notes due in at par and we immediately retired the notes 
on january   we prepaid million of mortgage debt related to two of our ritz carlton properties 
on september   we called million of senior notes due in may at of par 
we immediately retired the notes and recorded an extraordinary loss of  on the early retirement of the debt  which is presented in the statement of operations  net of million extraordinary gain on extinguishment of debt related to the transfer of the st 
louis marriott pavilion to the lender 
on june   we entered into a credit facility that provides an aggregate revolving loan commitment amount of up to million million of which is available currently  with the balance becoming available to the extent that our leverage ratio meets a specified level 
the credit facility has an initial three year term with an option to extend for an additional year if certain conditions are met 
interest on borrowings under the credit facility will be calculated based on a spread over libor ranging from to 
the rate will vary based on our leverage ratio 
we are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee that will vary based on the amount of unused capacity under the credit facility 
currently  the commitment fee is 
on an annual basis for available capacity and 
on additional capacity 
as of march   we have not drawn on the credit facility 
in addition to the customary affirmative and negative covenants and restrictions  the credit facility contains covenants that require us to maintain leverage ratios below specified levels as well as interest  fixed charges and unsecured interest coverage ratios above specified levels 
while we are currently in compliance with these maintenance covenants  our current forecasts indicate that we may fail to meet certain of these ratios during the second quarter of as a result  we expect to modify the financial covenants in our credit facility 
we do not have any amounts outstanding under the credit facility in advance of seeking a modification  and we believe that this will facilitate us in reaching an agreement with our lenders with regard to such a modification 
there can be no assurances  however  that we will  in fact  reach such an agreement 
in addition  any additional covenants could have an impact on our ability to conduct our operations 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture and the credit facility  our ability to incur indebtedness is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including an ebitda to cash interest coverage ratio of at least to beginning in the third quarter of  we have not met this interest coverage ratio incurrence test 
as a result  our ability to incur indebtedness is limited to indebtedness specifically permitted under the credit facility and the senior notes indenture  such as borrowings under the credit facility and borrowings in connection with a refinancing of existing debt 
our failure to meet this interest coverage ratio also restricts our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred equity  except to the extent necessary to maintain our status as a reit 
we are currently considering several options to improve our interest coverage 
these options could include  among others  retiring existing debt  swapping certain of our fixed interest rate debt for lower floating interest rate debt or acquiring properties with low or no indebtedness 
there can be no assurance that these options will be available to us  or if available  that these options would be economically justifiable to implement 
we have approximately billion of senior notes outstanding that are currently rated by moody s and standard poor s 
as a result of the significantly reduced operating levels which followed the september  terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown  the ratings on these senior notes and the senior notes issued by many other lodging companies were downgraded and placed on negative credit watch 
on february   standard and poor s downgraded its rating on our senior debt from bb to b 
at the same time standard poor s also downgraded its rating on our preferred stock from b to ccc 
the other rating agency affirmed our rating  but if operating results continue to decline  they will be more likely to downgrade their rating on our debt 
while we have no significant senior note maturities until  if operations were to decline further  or if our credit ratios do not otherwise improve  our senior notes could be downgraded further 
if we were unable to subsequently improve our credit ratings  our cost to issue additional senior notes  to refinance this debt as it comes due or to issue additional preferred stock would likely increase 
all of our mortgage debt is recourse solely to specific assets except for fraud  misapplication of funds and other customary recourse provisions 
we have thirty assets that are secured by mortgage debt 
twelve of these assets are secured by mortgage debt that contains restrictive covenants that require the mortgage servicer or lender to retain and hold in escrow the cash flow after debt service when it declines below specified operating levels 
the impact of these covenants is discussed below 
eight of our hotel properties secure a million mortgage loan that is the sole asset of a trust that issued commercial mortgage pass though certificates  which we refer to as the cmbs loan 
these hotels securing the cmbs loan are the new york marriott marquis  the san francisco airport hyatt regency  the cambridge hyatt regency  the reston hyatt regency  and the swiss tels in boston  new york  atlanta and chicago  which we refer to as the cmbs portfolio 
the cmbs loan contains a provision that requires the mortgage servicer to retain the excess cash from the cmbs portfolio after payment of debt service if net cash flow after payment of taxes  insurance  ground rent and reserves for furniture  fixtures and equipment for the trailing twelve months declines below million 
annual debt service is approximately million 
as a result of the effect on operations of the september  terrorist attacks and the economic slowdown  this provision was triggered beginning in the third quarter of and will remain in effect until the cmbs portfolio generates the necessary minimum cash flow for two consecutive quarters  at which point  the cash that has been escrowed will be returned to us 
as of december   approximately million of cash has been escrowed 
additional amounts will be escrowed  and these amounts may be significant 
there can be no assurance that the cmbs portfolio will reach the minimum cash flow for the required period of time so that the cash will be released 
on july   we modified the terms of the mortgage debt secured by our four canadian properties 
under the terms of this modification  we have agreed to escrow the excess cash flow from these hotels on a retroactive basis effective december  to the extent that cash flow available for debt service for the twelve months ended march  is insufficient to achieve a specified debt service coverage level  some or all of the escrowed excess cash flow will be applied to the outstanding balance of this debt 
thereafter  excess cash flow will continue to be applied to the outstanding balance to the extent necessary to achieve the specified level of debt service coverage 
as of december   approximately million of cash is escrowed in connection with this provision 
the majority of the balance will be applied to the outstanding balance of the indebtedness and the balance of the escrow will be released to us 
thereafter  we do not expect to be required to apply additional amounts of excess cash flow to the outstanding balance of the debt 
however  if actual results fall short of the current forecast  additional amounts may be escrowed  which would result in additional principal repayments being made 
derivative instruments 
historically  our debt has primarily been fixed rate including all of our previous series of senior notes 
we have increased the amount of our exposure to variable rate instruments with the issuance of our series h senior notes  which were subsequently exchanged into series i senior notes  by using a derivative product 
on december   we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  maturing in january under the swap  we receive fixed rate payments at and pay floating rate payments based on one month libor plus on a million notional amount 
on january   in a separate agreement with a different counterparty  we purchased an interest rate cap for million with the same notional amount which caps the floating interest rate at 
our canadian subsidiaries entered into financing agreements pursuant to which they borrowed million due august at a variable rate of libor plus 
since the mortgage loan on these canadian properties is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of the canadian subsidiary is the canadian dollar  we purchased derivative instruments for hedging of the foreign currency investment 
additionally  we purchased a separate interest rate cap relating to million of the debt for approximately  which effectively capped the interest rate at 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for additional information on these derivative instruments 
lease obligations hpt leases 
prior to  we divested certain limited service hotel properties through the sale and leaseback of courtyard by marriott properties and residence inn properties to hospitality properties trust  or hpt 
as part of the reit conversion  the courtyard and residence inn properties were subleased to subsidiaries of crestline 
the properties are managed by marriott international under long term management agreements 
rent payable by crestline under the non cancelable subleases consists of the minimum rent payable under the hpt leases plus an additional percentage rent based upon sales levels and is guaranteed by crestline up to a maximum amount of million 
other lease activities 
we have lease and sublease activity relating to our former restaurant operations for which we remain either directly or contingently liable 
as of december   the expected sublease rental income for the restaurant operations exceeded our lease liability

investments in affiliates we own certain investments which we do not consolidate and  accordingly  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting in accordance with our accounting policies as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have included the table below and the following discussion to provide investors with additional information on these investments 
investments in affiliates consist of the following as of december  ownership interests investment debt assets in millions cbm joint venture llc courtyard hotels jwdc limited partnership jw marriott  washington  dc tiburon golf ventures  lp hole golf course total one of our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries continues to own a interest in a joint venture with marriott international that owns  through two limited partnerships  courtyard by marriott properties totaling approximately  rooms 
the joint venture  cbm joint venture llc  had approximately million of debt at december  this debt is comprised of first mortgage loans secured by the properties owned by each of the two partnerships  senior notes secured by the ownership interest in one partnership and mezzanine debt with a face amount of million 
amortization for the mortgage debt was approximately million for the year ended december  the mezzanine debt is an obligation of the joint venture and was provided by an affiliate of marriott international 
all of the debt is non recourse to  and not guaranteed by  us or any of our subsidiaries 
revpar at the courtyard hotels declined in based on our current forecasts for  we expect that these hotels will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund the respective debt service obligations of the two partnerships 
however  because of seasonality issues  one of the partnerships is expected to make use of a senior note debt service reserve  as well as certain rights to require repayment to the partnership of certain expenses previously paid and subordination provisions for current payments in its ground leases and management agreements 
in addition  we anticipate that the joint venture will defer interest payments on the mezzanine debt at least until the second half of deferral of the interest payments due on the mezzanine debt is not a default 
to the extent deferred  unpaid balances are added to principal and earn interest at 
as of december   the partnerships and the joint venture maintained aggregate cash balances of approximately million

we do incur immaterial expenses related to these investments 
if we are able to dispose of these investments  we will recognize a gain in an amount equal to the proceeds received 
during the second and third quarters of  we sold our general partner interests in the marriott residence inn limited partnership and marriott residence inn ii limited partnership  which owned and residence inn properties  respectively 
for a more detailed discussion of our other real estate investments  which includes a summary of the outstanding debt balances of our affiliates  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
guarantees we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the guarantees are listed below we remain contingently liable for leases on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of rental payments 
the amount is approximately million as of december  in connection with the sale of the el paso marriott hotel in  we provided a guarantee to the city of el paso in the event the purchaser  columbia sussex  defaults on bonds supported by the cash flows from the hotel 
however  the purchaser also provided a standby letter of credit  a corporate guaranty and has been making sinking fund deposits  all of which would serve as collateral to the extent our guarantee was called 
our guarantee supports the million of bonds outstanding as of december  we have elected to exercise our right under the guarantee to require columbia sussex to retire the bonds prior to june  we are obligated to pay a  or  prepayment penalty in connection with the early retirement of this debt at the time of such retirement 
we  through our ownership interest in the operating partnership  are obligated under the partnership agreement and various tax sharing agreements with former affiliated entities to pay all taxes federal  state  local and foreign including any related interest and penalties incurred by us  as well as any liabilities that the irs successfully may assert against us and under certain circumstances against former affiliated entities 
as the potential liability is based in part on a finding by a specific taxing authority  these amounts cannot be estimated at this time 
in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we spun off the partnership as part of crestline in the reit conversion  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by crestline  who is indemnified by the subsequent purchaser of the facility 
insurance insurance recovery and revenue recognition for the terrorist acts 
we are working closely with our insurance companies to resolve our claims related to the destruction of the marriott world trade center and the damage to the new york marriott financial center  including negotiating insurance payments for property damage  as well as business interruption 
at the same time  we are working with the port authority of new york and new jersey  or port authority  and the lower manhattan development corporation to determine how the world trade center site in new york will be redeveloped  though we anticipate that it will be several years before these issues are resolved 
in accordance with accounting rules  we wrote off the million net book value of the world trade center hotel in the fourth quarter of and recorded a corresponding receivable for property insurance proceeds due to us under the terms of our insurance contract 
our property insurance policy covering the marriott world trade center provides payment of full replacement costs to rebuild the hotel 
we are required to rebuild the hotel under the terms of our ground lease with the port authority and are currently developing an estimate of the replacement cost of the hotel 
should the plan developed for the world trade center site not include a hotel  we have two options under our insurance policy first would be to apply the replacement cost to acquiring or constructing a hotel at another location  second would be to accept a lesser amount as defined in the insurance policy and not be required to apply that amount toward the acquisition or development of a hotel 
we have received minimal insurance proceeds for property damage at the marriott world trade center and  to the extent that we receive additional funds  they will be held in escrow by a trustee until there is a final resolution on rebuilding 
we reopened the new york marriott financial center on january  we have received a total of approximately million in insurance proceeds for property damage to this hotel  which have been used to pay for building repairs 
we expect to continue to receive business interruption proceeds for what we believe our operating results would have been at the marriott world trade center absent the terrorist attacks  although the timing of the receipt of some of these proceeds cannot be determined with certainty 
since september   we have received million in business interruption insurance with respect to the two hotels 
these proceeds have been offset by million of operating expenses for the same period  primarily representing net operating losses at the new york marriott financial center  ground lease payments at the marriott world trade center and severance and other payroll costs 
as a result of the resolution of certain contingencies related to a portion of the insurance recoveries  we were able to recognize approximately million of income associated with business interruption insurance on these two properties during  which is recorded in other hotel sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
insurance coverage 
certain of our lenders require us to obtain adequate or full replacement cost all risk property insurance through insurers that maintain certain ratings from standard poor s  am best or other rating agencies 
during the annual renewal of our property insurance policies  which was completed during the second quarter of  our managers and or brokers purchased the property insurance program that was commercially reasonable and available at that time 
however  we were unable to obtain full and complete terrorism insurance coverage for all types of terrorist attacks  although the passage of the terrorism risk insurance act of significantly improved the levels and breadth of coverage available 
further  certain of our insurance carriers did not meet lender rating requirements at the time of the renewal 
as a result of the terrorist attacks of september   the economic downturn and the potential for additional terrorist attacks  one of our major carriers on the marriott international property program was downgraded by the rating agencies  thereby exacerbating the rating non compliance issue 
we have notified our lenders and they have waived the requirement or provided written assurances that they are satisfied with our insurance regarding compliance with these covenants  although the lenders have reserved the right to enforce coverage and ratings requirements at a later date 
if we are required to obtain new or additional insurance  or if the lenders or servicers exercise their rights to purchase such coverage on our behalf and charge us for it  it is likely that the premiums will be higher and the increase in cost could be material 
for further discussion see risk factors risks of operation we may be unable to satisfy the insurance requirements of our lenders given the changes in the insurance industry after the terrorist attacks of september  insurance coverage on mexican properties 
we carry comprehensive insurance coverage for general liability  property  business interruption and other risks with respect to all of our hotels and other properties 
these policies offer coverage features and insured limits that we believe are customary for similar type properties 
one of our properties  the mexico city marriott airport hotel has experienced a measurable amount of settlement during the past several years 
while settlement of buildings in the region of mexico city where the hotel is located is common and widespread  our hotel has shown different degrees of settlement in different parts of the building 
while we have commenced remediation activities at this hotel  there can be no assurance that such remediation will successfully correct the uneven settlement 
if we are unable to correct the uneven settlement to the satisfaction of our insurers  any resulting property loss or loss of ability to use the hotel may not be covered by insurance 
the net book value of the hotel was million at december  ffo and ebitda set forth below are two non gaap financial measures that we use and that we believe are useful to investors comparative funds from operations or ffo available to common stockholders  which we refer to as comparative ffo  and earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization and other non cash items  or ebitda 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminish predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be misleading or uninformative 
the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  adopted the definition of funds from operations  or ffo  in order to promote an industry wide standard measure of reit operating performance that would not have certain drawbacks associated with net income under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
management believes that the presentation of comparative ffo defined below provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it is a measure of our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and expand our business 
however  comparative ffo and ebitda as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other companies 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets  interest expense for ebitda purposes only and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ebitda and comparative ffo presentations 
comparative ffo 
nareit defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate and real estate related depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
comparative ffo consists of ffo adjusted for significant non recurring items such as the tax benefit of the repurchase of the leasehold interests in and and tax refunds in we also adjust ffo to reflect the payment of our preferred dividends as these funds are not available to common shareholders  which is consistent with the calculation of net income available to common shareholders under gaap 
ebitda 
management believes that the presentation of ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because ebitda is useful for evaluating our capacity to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and to expand our business 
specifically  our lenders and rating agencies believe that ebitda is a better measure of unleveraged cash flow that can be isolated by asset and is utilized to determine our ability to service debt 
restrictive covenants in our senior notes indenture and our credit facility each contain incurrence ratios based on ebitda 
management also uses ebitda as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions 
as a result of the decline in operations  ebitda decreased million  or  to million in from million in comparative ffo available to common shareholders also decreased million  or  to million in over the following is a reconciliation of income from continuing operations to ebitda and comparative ffo in millions year ended december  december  income loss from continuing operations ebitda from discontinued operations interest expense dividends on convertible preferred securities depreciation and amortization minority interest expense income taxes lease repurchase expense equity in earnings losses of affiliates other changes  net ebitda of host lp distributions to minority interest partners of host lp ebitda of host marriott ebitda of host lp interest expense dividends on convertible preferred securities dividends on preferred stock income taxes partnership adjustments and other adjustments for discontinued operations tax benefit of lease repurchase tax effect of nonrecurring items comparative funds from operations of host lp available to common unitholders comparative funds from operations of minority partners of host lp comparative funds from operations available to common shareholders of host marriott distributions to minority interest partners of host lp of million in reflect cash distributions made during the year to minority holders of op units and holders of certain preferred op units 
no distributions were made during this adjustment reflects the realization of the income tax benefit from the purchase of leasehold interests at year end and june comparative ffo is adjusted to reflect the effect of non recurring items in the current period tax provision benefit including the resolution of prior year tax matters and other items 
we are the sole general partner in the operating partnership and as of december  and  held approximately and  respectively  of the outstanding op units 
the million and million deducted for and  respectively  represent the comparative ffo attributable to the interests in the operating partnership earned by the minority partners 
our interest coverage  defined as ebitda divided by cash interest expense  was times  times and times for  and  respectively 
the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends was to and to in and  respectively 
in  we had a deficiency of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends of million  primarily due to depreciation expense 
in accordance with securities and exchange commission regulations  the ratio is calculated as the sum of pre tax income from continuing operations before adjustments for minority interest and income loss from equity investments plus amortization of capitalized interest  distributions from equity investments and fixed charges less capitalized interest and dividends on preferred stock divided by fixed charges which is the sum of interest expensed and capitalized  dividends on convertible preferred securities and preferred stock and the estimate of interest within rental expense 
see exhibit inflation 
our properties have been impacted by inflation through its effect on increasing costs 
unlike other real estate  hotels have the ability to set rent room rates levels on a daily basis  so the impact of higher inflation often can be passed on to customers 
however  the current weak economic environment has resulted in a decline in demand and has restricted our managers ability to raise room rates to offset rising costs 
critical accounting policies 
our consolidated financial statements include accounts of the company and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require the use of business judgment or significant estimates to be made determination of fair value of long lived assets 
the determination of the fair value or impairment of assets is based on a number of assumptions including results of future operations and expected cash flows 
judgment is required for determining the growth rate of these properties  the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
additionally  the timing of this determination can be affected by the classification of these assets as held for sale 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets 
amortization expense for leasehold improvements is the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the life of the assets are based on a number of assumptions including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of the assets 
incentive management fees 
incentive management fees due to managers are accrued when earned  whether or not paid  based on stated formulas in management agreements 
however  judgment can be required during interim reporting periods as a result of the change in allocation ratios at specified times or upon the occurrence of certain events 
fees earned on a full year basis are not affected because the management fees are determined annually  however  there can be variation among the quarters which may affect reported results 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
currently  we have investments in entities that in the aggregate own hotel properties and other investments which we record using the equity method of accounting 
the debt on these investments is non recourse to the company and the effect of their operations on our results of operations is not material 
for further detail on our unconsolidated entities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting standards 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
this interpretation requires an existing unconsolidated variable interest entity to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risk among all parties involved or if other parties do not have significant capital to finance activities without subordinated financial support from the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity 
this interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  and no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  for interests in variable interest entities that were acquired prior to february  absent other circumstances  we believe that this interpretation will require us to consolidate the jwdc limited partnership  which owns the jw marriott hotel in washington  dc  during for more detail on our ownership interest in the jwdc limited partnership  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation outlines disclosure requirements in a guarantor s financial statements relating to any obligations under guarantees for which it may have potential risk or liability  as well as clarifies a guarantor s requirement to recognize a liability for the fair value  at the inception of the guarantee  of an obligation under that guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  as of march   we have not provided any guarantees that would require recognition as liabilities under this interpretation 
we have disclosed guarantees in accordance with this interpretation in this report on form k 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or operating results 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the provisions of this standard  which primarily relate to the rescission of statement  eliminate the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items unless it can be considered unusual in nature and infrequent in occurrence 
these provisions are effective in fiscal years beginning after may  we will implement the provisions of sfas no 
beginning in fiscal year at the time of implementation  we will reclassify any gains or losses from debt extinguishments in prior periods as income loss from operations 
we do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or operating results 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to determine when a long lived asset should be classified as held for sale  among other things 
those criteria specify that the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition  subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets  and the sale of the asset must be probable  and its transfer expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  within one year 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that for dispositions after the statement s effective date  gains and losses from the dispositions of investment properties and the properties historical operating results will be treated as discontinued operations  and therefore  be classified separately from income from continuing operations 
prior period operating results of disposed assets previously included in continuing operations must be reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented  although net income is not affected 
as a result of the transfer of the st 
louis marriott pavilion to the mortgage lender in  we have restated the statement of operations for all periods presented to reflect the operations of the property as discontinued operations see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we do not expect the statement to have a significant impact on our financial position or operating results 
change in accounting for stock options at december   we have two stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to our consolidated financial statements 
prior to  we accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost relating to the employee stock option plan is reflected in and net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in addition  no stock based employee compensation cost relating to the employee stock purchase plan is reflected in and net income as the plan was considered non compensatory under apb effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of the financial accounting standards board s sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prospectively to all employee awards granted  modified or settled after january  awards under our employee stock option plan generally vest over four years 
therefore  the cost related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not change the calculation of stock based employee compensation costs for shares granted under our deferred stock and restricted stock plans

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of december  notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

since the requirements for hedge accounting have been met  the swap is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in the fair value recorded to the carrying value of the series i senior notes 
additionally  the amounts paid or received under the swap agreement will be recognized over the life of the agreement as an adjustment to interest expense 
this interest rate swap agreement converted our payment obligations on the million amount from a fixed rate to a floating rate based on one month libor plus 
a change in the libor rate of basis points will result in million increase or decrease in our annual interest expense 
on january   in a separate agreement with a different counterparty  we purchased  for approximately million  an interest rate cap with the same notional amount million which caps the floating interest rate at on the swap agreement for the series i debt 
in august  we purchased an interest rate cap as part of our refinancing of million of debt on our canadian properties 
the interest rate cap was purchased for approximately million and is based on a notional amount million which caps the floating interest rate at 
under sfas  the caps do not qualify for hedge accounting  and  therefore  will be marked to market and the gains and losses from changes in the market value of the caps will be recorded in other income or expense in the current period 
as of december   approximately of our debt bears interest at fixed rates 
this debt structure largely mitigates the impact of changes in the rate of inflation on future interest costs 
we have some financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including our credit facility 
the interest rate on our credit facility is based on a spread over libor  ranging from to 
there were no amounts outstanding on our credit facility at december  the weighted average interest rate for our credit facility was for the year ended december  the weighted average interest rate for the prior credit facility was for the year ended december  the prior credit facility was repaid in full in december with the net proceeds from the offering of the series h senior notes  which were subsequently exchanged for series i senior notes  and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of two properties 
exchange rate sensitivity the table below summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates  including foreign currency forward exchange agreements 
for foreign currency forward exchange agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
these notional amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

in addition  since the mortgage loan on these canadian properties is denominated in us dollars and the functional currency of the canadian subsidiaries is the canadian dollar  the subsidiaries entered into currency forward contracts to hedge the currency exposure of converting canadian dollars to us dollars on a monthly basis to cover debt service payments 
this swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge of the debt service payments  and the forward contracts are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with offsetting changes recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the fair value of the forward contracts is recorded each period 
the weighted average interest rate for this mortgage loan was and  respectively  for the years ended december  and the fair value of the forward contracts was million and million  respectively  at december  and
