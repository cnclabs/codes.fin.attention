critical accounting policies use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management must make use of estimates in the areas discussed below 
revenue recognition the company s systems and services business provides its services under time and materials  cost reimbursable and fixed price contracts including service type contracts 
for time and materials contracts  revenue reflects the number of direct labor hours expended in the performance of a contract multiplied by the contract billing rate  as well as reimbursement of other billable direct costs 
the risk inherent in time and materials contracts is that actual costs differ materially from negotiated billing rates in the contract  which directly affects operating income 
for cost reimbursable contracts  revenue is recognized as costs are incurred and include a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
cost reimbursable contracts specify the contract fee in dollars or as a percentage of estimated costs 
the primary risk on a cost reimbursable contract is that a government audit of direct and indirect costs could result in the disallowance of certain costs  which would directly impact revenue and margin on the contract 
historically  such audits have had no material impact on the company s revenue and operating income 
under fixed price contracts  other than service type contracts  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  on the basis of costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs to complete the contract 
under service type contracts  costs incurred are not indicative of progression toward completion of the contract 
revenue from service type fixed price contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period or by other appropriate output methods to measure services provided  and contract costs are expensed as incurred 
the risk to the 
table of contents company on a fixed price contract is that if actual costs exceed the estimated costs to complete the contract  then profit is eroded or losses are incurred 
for all types of contracts  the company recognizes anticipated contract losses as soon as they become known and estimable 
out of pocket expenses that are reimbursable by the customer are included in contract revenue and cost of contract revenue 
unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process are the amounts of recoverable contract revenue that have not been billed at the balance sheet date 
most of the company s unbilled expenditures and fees relate to revenue that is billed in the month after services are performed 
in certain instances  billing is deferred in compliance with contract terms  such as milestone billing arrangements and withholdings 
costs related to united states government contracts  including applicable indirect costs  are subject to audit by the government 
revenue from such contracts has been recorded at amounts expected to be realized upon final settlement 
valuation allowances the company provides for potential losses against specifically identified accounts receivable and unbilled expenditures and fees on contracts in process based on the company s expectation of a customer s inability to pay 
these amounts are based upon specific identification of potential uncollectible accounts 
in addition  payment to the company for performance on united states government contracts are subject to audit by the defense contract audit agency 
the company provides an estimated reserve for adjustments resulting from rate negotiations and audit findings 
the company routinely provides for these items when they are identified and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the diversity of contracts with the united states government  it is not probable that the company will incur a material loss 
intangible and other long lived assets the company uses assumptions in establishing the carrying value  fair value and estimated lives of intangible and other long lived assets 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by a comparison of the asset s continuing ability to generate positive income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment is recognized in the period of identification and is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the useful lives and related amortization of intangible assets are based on their estimated residual value in proportion to the economic benefit consumed 
the useful lives and related depreciation of other long lived assets are based on the company s estimate of the period over which the asset will generate revenue or otherwise be used by the company 
goodwill the company assesses goodwill for impairment at the segment level at least once per year by applying a fair value test 
goodwill could be impaired due to market declines  reduced expected future cash flows  or other factors or events 
should the fair value of goodwill  as determined by the company at any measurement date  fall below its carrying value  a charge for impairment of goodwill would occur in that period 
business combinations during  the company acquired two companies  hj ford and andrulis 
all assets and liabilities acquired have been recorded at their fair values at the date of the acquisition and the results of operations are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the company has determined the fair value of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company has utilized an independent valuation specialist to determine the fair value of intangible assets acquired in order to allocate a portion of the purchase price related to intangible assets 
pensions accounting and reporting for the company s pension plan requires the use of assumptions  including but not limited to  discount rate  rate of compensation increases and expected return on invested assets 
if these assumptions materially differ from actual results  the company s obligations under the pension plan could also materially differ  requiring the company to record an additional pension liability
