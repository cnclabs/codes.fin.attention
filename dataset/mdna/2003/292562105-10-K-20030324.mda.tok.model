item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following management s discussion and analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of key factors  drivers and risks regarding the company and the building wire industry 
general price competition for electrical wire and cable is intense and the company sells its products in accordance with prevailing market prices 
copper  a commodity product  is the principal raw material used by the company in manufacturing its products 
copper accounted for approximately    and of the company s cost of goods sold during fiscal    and  respectively 
the price of copper fluctuates  depending on general economic conditions and in relation to supply and demand and other factors  and has caused monthly variations in the cost of copper purchased by the company 
the company cannot predict copper prices in the future or the effect of fluctuations in the cost of copper on the company s future operating results 
results of operations the following table presents certain items of income and expense as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold copper other raw materials depreciation labor and overhead lifo adjustment lower of cost or market adjustment gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected the operating results of the company for the years ended december    and reference should also be made to the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
net sales were million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in net sales in over was the net result of a increase in the volume of copper pounds of product sold  offset by a decrease in average price of product sold and a slight change in the mix of product sold 
the decrease from to resulted from an increase in sales volume  offset by an decrease in the average price of product sold and a slight change in the mix 
sales volume increases were due to several factors  including increased customer acceptance and product availability 
in  the company continued to expand sales to the existing customer base and increased the number of customers to which it sold its products 
the decrease in the average price of product sold in was due primarily to intense price competition in the building wire industry resulting in a compression of the company s margins 
the company currently sells its products to at least of the top wholesale electrical distributors by volume in the united states  as reported in the september issue of electrical wholesaling magazine 
cost of goods sold was million in  compared to million in and million in copper costs decreased slightly to million in from million in and million in copper costs as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in and increased from in the slight decrease as a percentage of net sales was due primarily to changes in the mix of products sold 
other raw material costs as a percentage of net sales were  and  in   and  respectively 
the decrease is due primarily to the company s cost of other raw materials per pound of copper sold declining more than the price of copper wire sold 
depreciation  labor and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales were in  compared to in and in the percentage increase in was due to these costs containing significant fixed components versus the elastic nature of the price of copper wire sold as well as an increase of  in depreciation cost in stemming from the manufacturing expansion plant that was completed during inventories consist of the following at december raw materials   work in process   finished goods   adjust to lifo cost   lower of cost or market adjustment   although copper prices were relatively stable in  the price at the end of was higher than at the end of and the copper pounds in inventory were reduced during the year 
as a result of the increase in the cost of copper in  the value of all inventories at december  using the lifo method was greater than the fifo value by approximately  resulting in a corresponding increase in the cost of goods sold of  at december   lifo value was less than the market value of the inventory  thereby requiring a reversal of the previously established lower of cost or market reserve of approximately  and a corresponding decrease in the cost of goods sold 
the net effect of these two adjustments increased cost of goods sold by  as of december   the value of all inventories using the lifo method was greater than the fifo value by  this differential exceeded the december  differential of  by  resulting in a corresponding decrease in cost of goods sold 
as of december   the lifo cost basis of inventory exceeded its market value by  resulting in the company establishing a lower of cost or market reserve for this amount  which increased cost of goods sold 
the net effect of these two adjustments decreased cost of goods sold by  as of december   the value of all inventories using the lifo method was greater than the fifo value by  this differential was  less than the december  differential of  resulting in a corresponding increase in cost of goods sold 
as of december   the lifo cost basis of inventory exceeded its market value by  resulting in the company establishing a lower of cost or market reserve for this amount  which increased cost of goods sold by  the net effect of these two adjustments increased cost of goods sold for the year by  gross profit decreased to million  or of nets sales  in from million  or of net sales  in and million  or of net sales  in the changes in gross profit were due to the factors discussed above 
selling expenses  which include freight and sales commissions  were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses remained consistent at in  in and in general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses were in  in and in in  general and administrative costs decreased due to cost controls 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in and  in the decrease in is due to lower floating interest rates and higher capitalization of interest expense offset somewhat by higher debt levels  while the decrease was due to lower average debt levels coupled with lower floating interest rates 
the company capitalized interest expense relating to the construction of assets in the amounts of approximately  in   in and in the company s effective tax rate was in  and as a result of the foregoing factors  the company s net income was million in  million in and million in off balance sheet arrangements the company does not currently have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues of expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s cash flow activities 
year ended december  in thousands net income    adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by used in operating activities depreciation and amortization    other non cash items  increase decrease in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets    increase decrease in trade accounts payable  accrued liabilities and other liabilities    net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities purchases of property  plant and equipment net    financing activities increase decrease in indebtedness  net    issuances of common stock   purchase of treasury stock    net cash provided used in by financing activities    net increase decrease in cash    the company maintains a substantial inventory of finished products to satisfy customers prompt delivery requirements 
as is customary in the industry  the company provides payment terms to most of its customers that exceed terms that it receives from its suppliers 
therefore  the company s liquidity needs have generally consisted of operating capital necessary to finance these receivables and inventory 
capital expenditures have historically been necessary to expand the production capacity of the company s manufacturing operations 
the company has historically satisfied its liquidity and capital expenditure needs with cash generated from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facilities and sales of its common stock 
effective august   the company through its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary  encore wire limited  a texas limited partnership  refinanced its unsecured loan facility with a group of banks the financing agreement 
the company is a guarantor of the indebtedness 
obligations under the financing agreement are the only contractual obligations or commercial commitments of the company 
the financing agreement has been amended twice since august   to extend the term to may  and then again to may  the financing agreement provides for maximum borrowings of the lesser of million or the amount of eligible accounts receivable plus the amount of eligible finished goods and raw materials  less any available reserves established by the banks 
the calculated maximum borrowing amount available at december   as computed under the financing agreement  was million 
the financing agreement is unsecured and contains customary covenants and events of default 
the company was in compliance with these covenants  as of december  pursuant to the financing agreement  the company is prohibited from declaring  paying or issuing cash dividends 
at december   the balance outstanding under the financing agreement was million

in december  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on million of its variable rate debt in order to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates 
the terms of the agreement fix the interest rate on million of the company s variable rate  long term note payable to per annum plus a variable adder that is based on certain financial ratios contained in the loan covenants 
this three year agreement expires in december for the year ended december   the company recorded an unrealized loss of  resulting in a total unrealized loss of  recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the balance sheet 
on november   the board of directors of the company approved a new stock repurchase program covering the purchase of up to  additional shares of its common stock dependent upon market conditions 
common stock purchases under this program were authorized through december  on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prices determined by the chairman of the board or the president of the company 
as of december    shares had been purchased under this authorization 
early in  the board of directors extended this program through december for the remaining  shares 
cash provided by operations was million in compared to million in and million provided in the decrease of million from to was primarily the result of a million decrease in accounts payable in  a million increase in inventories and a million decrease in earnings 
the increase of million from to was the result of increased earnings  depreciation and deferred taxes 
cash used in investing activities increased to million in from million in due to the new building construction and related equipment purchases 
cash used in investing activities increased to million in from million due to new building construction and related equipment purchases 
during and  capital expenditures rose to build plant and buy new manufacturing equipment 
this project was completed as of december  the cash provided by financing activities in was used primarily to fund these capital expenditures 
the cash consumed by financing activities in and was primarily used to decrease borrowings on the company s loan facility by million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities was reduced by million in  million in and million in  as a result of the purchase of treasury stock 
cash provided by financing activities was increased by million in  million in and million in  as the result of the issuance of common stock  primarily to satisfy employee option exercises 
during  the company expects its capital expenditures will consist of maintaining and adding manufacturing equipment for its residential and commercial wire operations 
the total capital expenditures associated with these capital expenditures are estimated to be less than million in the company also expects its working capital requirements to increase during as a result of continued increases in sales and potential increases in the cost of copper 
moreover  the company expects that the inventory levels necessary to support sales of commercial wire will continue to be greater than the levels necessary to support comparable sales of residential wire 
the company believes that the cash flow from operations and the financing available from its revolving credit facility will satisfy working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the last in  first out lifo method  or market 
the company maintains only one inventory pool for lifo purposes as all inventories held by the company generally relate to the company s only business segment  the manufacture and sale of copper building wire products 
as permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  the company maintains its inventory costs and cost of goods sold on a first in  first out fifo basis and makes a quarterly adjustment to adjust total inventory and cost of goods sold from fifo to lifo 
the company applies the lower of cost or market test by comparing the lifo cost of its raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventories to estimated market values  which are based primarily upon the most recent quoted market price of copper and finished wire prices as of the end of each reporting period 
as of december   a reduction in the fair market value of copper would have required the company to increase its lower of cost or market reserve and cost of goods sold by approximately  for the year ended december  additionally  future reductions in the quantity of inventory on hand could cause copper that is carried in inventory at costs different from the cost of copper in the period in which the reduction occurs to be included in costs of goods sold for that period at the different price 
the company has provided an allowance for losses on customer receivables based upon estimates of those customers inability to make required payments 
such estimate is established and adjusted based upon the makeup of the current receivable portfolio  past bad debt experience and current market conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments to the company  additional allowances for losses might be required in future periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of asset retirement obligations be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of related long lived assets 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after june   with early adoption permitted 
the company adopted sfas no 
as of january  and does not believe the adoption had a material effect on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 providing a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and measured for impairment 
although retaining many of the fundamental recognition and measurement principles of sfas no 
 the new rules significantly change the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
sfas no 
also supersedes apb opinion with regard to reporting the effects of discontinued operations 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company has adopted sfas no 
on january  and the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes eitf and requires that liabilities for exit or disposal activities be recorded when the liabilities are actually incurred 
sfas no 
is applicable for exit or disposal activities occurring after december  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 providing alternative transition methods to the fair value based method of accounting for stock compensation 
sfas no 
also requires additional annual and quarterly disclosures related to stock based compensation arrangements 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to transition methods and annual disclosure requirements are applicable to fiscal years ending after december  and the provisions related to interim disclosure requirements are effective for financial reports for interim periods beginning after december information regarding forward looking statements this report contains various forward looking statements and information that are based on management s belief as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to management 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
such statements are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those expected 
among the key factors that may have a direct bearing on the company s operating results are fluctuations in the economy and in the level of activity in the building and construction industry  demand for the company s products  the impact of price competition and fluctuations in the price of copper 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not engage in metal futures trading or hedging activities and does not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for trading or other speculative purposes 
however  the company is generally exposed to commodity price and interest rate risks 
in order to take advantage of the low prevailing interest rates at the end of  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on million of its long term debt 
this arrangement was entered into to fix the interest rate on that portion of the debt until december  the company purchases copper cathode primarily from producers and merchants at prices determined each month based on the average daily closing prices for copper for that month  plus a negotiated premium 
as a result  fluctuations in copper prices caused by market forces can significantly affect the company s financial results 
interest rate risk is attributable to the company s long term debt 
effective august   the company through its indirectly wholly owned subsidiary  encore wire limited  refinanced the financing agreement 
the amounts outstanding under the financing agreement are payable on may   with interest due quarterly based on the bank s prime rate or libor rate options  at the company s election 
at december   the balance outstanding under the financing agreement was million  and the average interest rate was 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
the company hedged a portion of its outstanding debt to protect itself against rising interest rates 
a interest rate increase in would increase interest expense by  for further information  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
