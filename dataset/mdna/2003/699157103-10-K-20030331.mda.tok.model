item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
for a description of limitations inherent in forward looking statements  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements on page ii 
general since  our primary focus has been exploratory drilling using d seismic technology 
however  we described on page of this report  we revised our business plan last year 
generally  our revised business plan places less emphasis on high risk exploration efforts 
we now emphasize reducing drilling risks by dedicating a smaller portion of our capital to high risk projects  while reserving the majority of our available capital for exploitation  enhancement and development drilling opportunities 
obtaining positions in long lived oil and gas reserves is given priority over properties that might provide more cash flow in the early years of production  but which have shorter reserve lives 
our risk reduction efforts also include emphasizing acquisition possibilities over high risk exploration projects 
although we anticipate participating in exploratory drilling activities in the future  reducing financial  reservoir  drilling and geological risks and diversifying our property portfolio are important criteria in the execution of our business plan 
in summary  our current business plan 
focuses on projects having less geological risk  
entails less exploratory activity in the down dip wilcox trend of our south texas properties  
emphasizes exploitation and enhancement activities  
focuses on acquiring producing properties  and 
expands the scope of operations by diversifying our exploratory and development efforts  both in and outside of our current areas of operation 
operating performance our operating performance is influenced by several factors  the most significant of which are the prices we receive for our oil and gas and our production volumes 
the world price for oil has overall influence on the prices that we receive for our oil production 
the prices received for different grades of oil are based upon the world price for oil  which is then adjusted based upon the particular grade 
typically  light oil is sold at a premium  while heavy grades of crude are discounted 
gas prices we receive are influenced by 
seasonal demand  
weather  
hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico  
availability of pipeline transportation to end users  
proximity of our wells to major transportation pipeline infrastructures  and 
to a lesser extent  world oil prices 
additional factors influencing our overall operating performance include 
production expenses  
overhead requirements  and 
costs of capital 
our oil and gas exploration  development and acquisition activities require substantial and continuing capital expenditures 
historically  the sources of financing to fund our capital expenditures have included 
cash flow from operations  
sales of our equity securities  and 
bank borrowings 
depletion per ebo in was versus in and in the increase per ebo in was a result of an increase of approximately million in the net oil and gas properties depletable base 
our oil and gas producing activities are accounted for using the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting method  we capitalize all costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of oil and gas properties and the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
see note to the financial statements 
these costs include lease acquisition costs  geological and geophysical expenditures  costs of drilling productive and non productive wells  and overhead expenses directly related to land acquisition and exploration and development activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and gas properties are accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized unless a disposition involves a material change in reserves  in which case the gain or loss is recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including estimated future development costs  is provided using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves and production  which are converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
unproved oil and gas properties are not amortized  but are individually assessed for impairment 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and gas properties being depleted 
results of operations our business activities are characterized by frequent  and sometimes significant  changes in our 
reserve base  
sources of production  
product mix gas versus oil volumes  and 
the prices we receive for our oil and gas production

critical accounting policies and practices full cost 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
costs of non producing properties  wells in process of being drilled and significant development projects are excluded from depletion until such time as the related project is developed and proved reserves are established or impairment is determined 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling 
provision for depletion of oil and gas properties  under the full cost method  is calculated using the unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and gas reserves with oil and gas production being converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative energy content 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
the cost of any impaired property is transferred to the balance of oil and gas properties being depleted 
our discounted present value of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
our reserve estimates are prepared by outside consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost ceiling writedown 
in addition to the impact of these estimates of proved reserves on calculation of the ceiling  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are held constant indefinitely 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that we use prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on any particular day at the end of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than prices we actually receive in the long term  which are a barometer for true fair value 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective values 
sfas no 
and sfas no 
are effective for all fiscal quarters of all fiscal years beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
on january  as of december   we utilized mark to market accounting for derivatives and the changes in fair value are recognized currently in earnings with a respective offset in the balance sheet 
impairment of assets 
under the full cost accounting rules  the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties may not exceed a ceiling limit  which is based on the present value of estimated future net revenues  net of income tax effects  from proved reserves  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a ceiling test write down to the extent of the excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and gas prices decline 
if commodity prices deteriorate  it is possible that we could incur an impairment in deferred tax asset 
the deferred tax asset represents future tax deductions  tax credits and carryforwards that are expected to be realized by reducing future income tax expense 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our estimate of future taxable income is impacted by the historical volatility in crude oil and gas prices  the uncertainty of future commodity prices  and our history of generating net losses 
in  we were unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize all the available carryforwards prior to their ultimate expiration 
in  the valuation allowance was reversed since we expected to be able to utilize the carryforwards prior to their expiration due to the expected sale of first permian s properties  which occurred in april  there were no remaining net deferred tax assets at december  years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
our total oil and gas revenues for were  a decrease of  or approximately  from  for the decrease in revenues for  compared to  is related to a decline in the average price we received for our oil and natural gas production volumes  and a decline in oil and natural gas production volumes on an ebo basis 
production 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production totaled  ebo compared with  ebo in  a decrease  mainly resulting from an decrease in natural gas production 
the decrease in natural gas production was primarily due to production declines  which was partially offset by our drilling activities in production costs 
the decrease in production costs for  compared with  was primarily the result of decreased production volumes and  to a lesser extent  reduction in ad valorem taxes and other direct operating expenses 
production costs decreased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   from  for the same period of general and administrative costs 
overall general and administrative expenses increased  or to  for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses for the same period of were  the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased public reporting costs  increased costs associated with our new office and increased staffing needs associated with our new business plan 
we capitalized  of general and administrative expenses 
depreciation depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for were slightly lower at  as compared to  depreciation depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for were slightly lower at  as compared to in the decline was attributable to an increase in reserves as of december   which was partially offset by an increase in net depletable property basis 
impairment of oil and gas properties 
we recognized a noncash impairment charge of  in the third quarter of  and a noncash impairment change of  in the fourth quarter of  in each case related to our oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of oil and gas assets was primarily the result of the effect of significantly lower oil and natural gas prices on both proved and unproved oil and gas properties 
we did not recognize an impairment in equity in income of first permian  lp as discussed in note to the financial statements  first permian  lp sold all of its oil and gas properties on april  as the owner of a interest in first permian  we received our prorata share of the net sales proceeds  or million in cash and  shares of common stock of energen corporation 
our pro rata share of the net income and distributions for was  first permian incentive awards 
the incentive awards reflect bonus payments made to certain officers and employees in as a result of first permian s sale of all of its assets 
additional information about these awards can be found under the caption incentive award agreements on page of this report 
loss on marketable securities 
we recognized a loss in marketable securities in the amount of  which resulted from our sales of  shares of energen common stock during this loss represents the difference in energen s stock price of per share at the time of the first permian sale and our realized net price of approximately per share 
change in fair value of put options 
we also recognized a loss of  which represents the decrease in fair value of our natural gas puts for the period ended december  see note to the financial statements 
change in fair value of crude oil swap 
a loss of  was recognized in connection with marking to market our crude oil swaps that were implemented on november  in association with our purchase of the fullerton properties 
see note to the financial statements 
dividend income 
dividend income during was  associated with our investment in and ownership of energen common stock 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of this decrease was principally a result of a decrease in average borrowings with the sale of the energen stock and lower interest rates 
income tax benefit expense 
for the period ended december   we recorded federal and state income tax expense of  and  respectively 
see note to the financial statements 
net income loss and cash flow from operations 
our income  before preferred stock dividends  was  for the year ended december   compared with a loss of  for the year ended december  in  income of  resulted entirely from the sale of first permian s oil and gas properties  net of incentive awards attributable to first permian s sale of its assets 
other items affecting net income included 
a decrease in oil and gas revenues related to a decline in volumes and average price received  
decreased production costs of approximately primarily related to decreased production volumes and  to a lesser extent  reductions in ad valorem taxes and other direct operating expenses  
increased general and administrative expenses of  increased public reporting costs  increased costs associated with our new office and increased staffing needs associated with our new business plan  and 
non cash charges associated with the sale of energen stock  fair market value of our put options and mark to market of the crude oil swaps 
cash flow from operations for declined approximately  or to  compared with  for the year ended december  the decline is primarily due to declines in oil and gas volumes and prices  an increase in current assets over current liabilities and an increase in staffing needs associated with our new business plan 
years ended december  and december  oil and gas revenues 
parallel s total oil and gas revenues for were  an increase of  or approximately  from  for the increase in revenues for  compared to  is related to a decline in the average prices we received for our oil and natural gas production volumes  and to a increase in production volumes 
production 
on an equivalent barrel basis  production totaled  ebo compared with  ebo in  a increase  resulting from a increase in natural gas production 
the increase in natural gas production was primarily due to increased drilling activity in production costs 
the increase in production costs for  compared with  was primarily the result of adding higher cost oil and gas production  an increase in ad valorem taxes and  to a lesser degree  an increase in production volumes 
production costs increased  or  to  for the twelve months ended december   from  for the same period of production costs as a percentage of revenues increased primarily because of slightly lower oil and gas prices 
average production costs per ebo increased to for the twelve months ended december  compared to in the same period of general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased  or to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to salary and benefit adjustments and increased franchise taxes 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period in this increase is primarily a result of the low oil and gas prices we received in  which reduced revenues 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses for increased  or to  from  for as a percentage of revenues  dd a increased to compared to in the dd a rate per ebo increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period of the increase in the dd a rate per ebo is attributable to an increase in net depletable property basis and a decrease in reserves as of december  impairment of oil and gas properties 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we recognized a noncash impairment charge of  and  respectively  related to our oil and gas reserves and unproved properties 
the impairment of oil and gas assets was primarily the result of the effect of significantly lower oil and natural gas prices on both proved and unproved oil and gas properties 
we did not recognize an impairment in under full cost accounting rules  each quarter we are required to perform a ceiling test calculation 
the full cost pool carrying values cannot exceed a company s future net revenues from its proved reserves  discounted at per annum using constant current product prices  and the lower of cost or market of unproved properties 
at december   oil and natural gas prices were lower compared with year end prices  resulting in an impairment charge to the full cost carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
the ceiling test was computed using the net present value of reserves at december  based on prices of per bbl of oil and per mcf of natural gas 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the same period of this decrease was principally a result of a decrease in average borrowings from our revolving line of credit facility and lower interest rates 
income tax benefit expense 
a valuation allowance is proved when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we established a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of  this was due to the historical volatility in crude oil and gas prices  the uncertainty of future commodity prices  and our history of generating net losses 
management was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that we would be able to utilize all the available carryforwards prior to their ultimate expiration 
in the valuation allowance was reversed as we expected to be able to utilize the available carryforwards prior to their expiration due to the impending sale of first permian s properties 
we recognized a tax expense in of  related to alternative minimum tax 
our effective tax rate for was approximately versus in due to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance provided in you should read note to the financial statements  for further discussion of our income tax provisions and benefits 
net income loss and cash flow from operations 
our net loss  before preferred stock dividends  was  for the year ended december   compared with net income of  for the year ended december  the loss was primarily caused by a third and fourth quarter noncash impairment charge to oil and gas properties totaling  the result of slightly lower oil and gas prices at year end other factors contributing to the loss included 
a increase in depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses  again a result of the low commodity price environment and an impairment charge to unproved properties  which increased the full cost pool  
a decrease in net interest expense due to decreased bank borrowings  
a decrease in the average price we received for our production  and 
a increase in production volumes 
cash flow from operations for increased approximately  or  to  compared with  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to a  decrease in accounts receivable offset by a  decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
capital resources and liquidity our level of earnings and cash flows depend on many factors  including the prices of oil and natural gas 
typically  our capital resources consist primarily of cash flows from our oil and gas properties and bank borrowings supported by our oil and gas reserves 
however  these resources were supplemented last year with our share of proceeds from the sale of first permian s properties 
excluding the first permian sale  our primary sources of cash during were funds generated from operations and bank borrowings 
funds from these two sources were used primarily for exploration and development expenditures  dividend payments on our preferred stock and the repayment of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the additional capital resources available to us as a result of the first permian sale were used to repay part of our bank debt  which created additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility 
we used this additional borrowing capacity in december  when we borrowed million which was used in partial payment of the purchase price of the fullerton properties 
during  we spent approximately  on exploration and development  seismic data processing and acquisitions 
long term debt  excluding current maturities  increased by  to  at december   parallel had  in cash  which included part of the proceeds from sales of our shares of energen stock  and total assets of  we had no availability for additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility at december  bank borrowings on december   parallel and its subsidiary  parallel  lp  entered into a first amended and restated credit agreement with first american bank  ssb  western national bank and bnp paribas 
we entered into the credit agreement for the purposes of refinancing the outstanding indebtedness under our prior credit agreement with first american bank  and establishing a larger credit facility to provide additional funds for the purchase of the fullerton properties 
before we closed the loan transaction   bearing interest at  was outstanding under our prior credit facility 
on december   when we entered into our amended and restated credit agreement and closed the purchase of the fullerton properties  the initial borrowing base was established by the banks at million  based on the loan value attributed by the banks to our oil and gas properties and shares of energen stock 
our total borrowings after purchasing the fullerton properties were million 
the credit facility provides for revolving loans 
this means that we can borrow  repay and reborrow funds drawn under the credit facility 
however  the aggregate amount that we can borrow and have outstanding at any one time is subject to a borrowing base and a monthly commitment reduction 
generally  we can borrow only up to the borrowing base in effect from time to time 
the monthly commitment reduction commences on august  and continues with a like reduction on the last day of each following month 
the amount of the monthly commitment reduction is determined by dividing a the borrowing base on the day immediately preceding the date of each monthly commitment reduction by b the number of months remaining prior to july  the borrowing base and the monthly commitment reduction amount will be redetermined by the banks on or about april and october of each year or at other times requested by parallel 
at march   the borrowing base had been reduced to million as a result of all of our shares of energen stock having been sold 
if  as a result of the banks redetermination of the borrowing base  the outstanding principal amount of our loan exceeds the borrowing base  we must either provide additional collateral to the banks or prepay the principal of the note in an amount equal to the excess 
if the outstanding principal amount of our loan exceeds the borrowing base as a result of the monthly commitment reduction  we must immediately repay to the bank an amount equal to the difference between the outstanding principal balance of the loan and the borrowing base 
we do not have the option to pledge additional collateral in this circumstance 
except for the principal payments that may be required because of our outstanding loans being in excess of the borrowing base  interest only is payable monthly 
the principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility bears interest at first american bank s base rate or the libor rate  at our election 
generally  first american bank s base rate is equal to the prime rate published in the wall street journal  but not less than 
the libor rate is generally equal to the sum of a the rate designated as british bankers association interest settlement rates and offered on one  two  three or six month interest periods for deposits of  and b a margin ranging from to  depending upon the outstanding principal amount of the loans 
the interest rate we are required to pay  including the applicable margin  may never be less than 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than of the borrowing base established by the banks  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is equal to or greater than  but less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
if the principal amount outstanding is less than of the borrowing base  the margin is 
in the case of base rate loans  interest is payable on the last day of each month 
in the case of libor loans  interest is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
if the total outstanding borrowings under the facility are less than the borrowing base  an unused commitment fee is required to be paid to the bank lenders 
the amount of the fee is 
of the daily average of the unadvanced amount of the borrowing base 
the fee is payable quarterly  commencing on march all outstanding principal under the revolving credit facility is due and payable on december  the loan is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties  including the properties parallel  lp acquired from jmc exploration  inc and arkoma star  llc in december  parallel  llc  a subsidiary of parallel petroleum corporation  guaranteed payment of the loans 
we are highly dependent on bank borrowings to fund our exploration and drilling activities 
our borrowing base is generally equivalent to the loan value of our producing oil and gas properties as determined by the bank in its sole discretion 
if our borrowing base declines significantly  our liquidity would be suddenly and materially limited 
if the borrowing base is increased  we are required to pay a fee of 
on the amount of any increase in the borrowing base 
our obligations to the bank are secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties 
our bank borrowings have been incurred to finance our property acquisition  d seismic surveys  enhancement and drilling activities 
in addition to customary affirmative covenants  the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants and compliance requirements  including 
maintaining certain financial ratios  
limitations on incurring additional indebtedness  
prohibiting the payment of dividends on our common stock  
limitations on the disposition of assets  and 
prohibiting liens other than in favor of the lenders to exist on any of our properties 
if we have borrowing capacity under our credit agreement  we intend to borrow  repay and reborrow under the revolving credit facility from time to time as necessary  subject to borrowing base limitations  to fund 
interpretation and processing of d seismic survey data  
lease acquisitions  
drilling activities on properties in our cook mountain project in liberty county  texas  and in the yegua frio wilcox gas trend of south texas  
developmental drilling on our permian basin properties  when economically feasible  
other drilling expenditures and acquisition opportunities  and 
general corporate purposes 
at december  we had  shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding 
the preferred stock

has no voting rights  except as required by applicable law  and  except that as long as any shares of preferred stock remain outstanding  the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the preferred stock may vote on any proposal to change any provision of the preferred stock which materially and adversely affects the rights  preferences or privileges of the preferred stock 

is senior to the common stock with respect to dividends and on liquidation  dissolution or winding up of parallel 

has a liquidation value of per share  plus accrued and unpaid dividends 
commodity price risk management transactions certain of our commodity price risk management arrangements have required us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price risk management transactions exceed certain levels 
with the primary objective of achieving more predictable revenues and cash flows and reducing the exposure to fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices  we have entered into price risk management transactions of various kinds with respect to both oil and natural gas 
while the use of certain of these price risk management arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
we engage in transactions such as swaps and collars which are marked to market at the end of the relevant accounting period 
since the futures market historically has been highly volatile  these fluctuations may cause significant impact on the results of any given accounting period 
we have entered into price risk management transactions with respect to a substantial portion of our estimated production for the remainder of through we continue to evaluate whether to enter into additional price risk management transactions for and future years 
in addition  we may determine from time to time to unwind our then existing price management positions as part of our price risk management strategy 
future capital requirements our capital expenditure budget for is approximately million and is highly dependent on future oil and gas prices and the availability of funding 
these expenditures will be governed by the following factors 
internally generated cash flows  
availability of borrowing under our revolving credit facility  
additional sources of financing  and 
future drilling successes 
in  we intend to drill lower risk natural gas prospects that could have a meaningful effect on our reserve base and cash flows 
in selected cases  we may elect to reduce our interest in higher risk  higher impact projects 
we may also sell certain non core producing properties to raise funds for capital expenditures 
the following table is a summary of significant contractual cash obligations obligation due in period contractual cash obligations total s revolving credit facility secured        office lease formerly occupied office lease presently occupied outlook the oil and gas industry is capital intensive 
we make  and anticipate that we will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures in the exploration for  development and acquisition of oil and gas reserves 
historically  our capital expenditures have been financed primarily with 
internally generated cash from operations  
proceeds from bank borrowings  and 
proceeds from sales of equity securities 
the continued availability of these capital sources depends upon a number of variables  including 
our proved reserves  
the volumes of oil and gas we produce from existing wells  
the prices at which we sell oil and gas  and 
our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
each of these variables materially affects our borrowing capacity 
we may from time to time seek additional financing in the form of 
increased bank borrowings  o sales of parallel s securities  
sales of non core properties  or o other forms of financing 
we do not have agreements for any future financing and there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such financing 
trends and prices changes in oil and gas prices significantly affect our revenues  cash flows and borrowing capacity 
markets for oil and gas have historically been  and will continue to be  volatile 
prices for oil and gas typically fluctuate in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty  seasonal  political and other factors beyond our control 
we are unable to accurately predict domestic or worldwide political events or the effects of other factors on the prices we receive for our oil and gas 
during  the average sales price we received for our oil production was approximately per bbl  as compared with in  while the average sales price for our gas was approximately per mcf in  as compared with per mcf in at march   we were receiving an average of per bbl for our oil production and per mcf for our gas production  excluding our hedging activities 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not believe that inflation poses a material risk to our business 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which establishes requirements for the accounting of removal type costs associated with asset retirements 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
we used an expected cash flow approach to estimate our asset retirement obligation under sfas no 
upon adoption on january   we recorded a retirement obligation of  an increase in property cost of  a reduction of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of  and a cumulative effect of accounting change loss  net of tax  of  as a result of adoption of sfas no 
 we estimated that in accretion of discount expense will be approximately  and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense will decrease approximately  in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
most significantly  this statement eliminates the requirement under statement to aggregate all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and if material  be classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they met the criteria in opinion applying the provisions of opinion will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
there is no current impact to our financial statements as there has been no early extinguishment of debt which meets the criteria for an extraordinary item 
in july  the fasb issued statement no   accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
statement no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we expect no impact on our financial statements since we do not anticipate exiting or disposing of any of our activities 
statement no

the statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the statement is required to be adopted for fiscal years ending after december  we account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no

 requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without financial support from other parties 
we do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effects of derivative instruments we use various derivative instruments to mitigate the volatility of commodity prices 
as of december   we entered into a month oil swap contract 
under the terms of the oil swap  we will receive certain fixed prices averaging per bbl for approximately of our estimated oil production after the fullerton acquisition 
subsequent to december   we entered into various additional oil and gas hedge contracts 
see note to the financial statements 
as of january  we entered into a month libor fixed interest rate swap contract 
we will receive fixed day libor interest rates for the month period beginning march  through december  you can find more information about our interest rate swap  including notional amounts  in the table appearing on page of this report 
as of december   our derivative instruments were recorded using mark to market accounting  whereby the instruments were recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair market value 
a corresponding income or expense is recorded in other income expense in the statement of income loss 
effective january   we have elected to apply hedge accounting to the derivative instruments 
for derivatives qualifying as hedges  the changes in fair market value are recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income loss and then reclassified to earnings when the transaction is settled 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty in its derivative instruments 
however  we try to assess the creditworthiness of the counterparty to mitigate this credit risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following quantitative and qualitative information is provided about derivative instruments to which parallel was a party at december   and from which parallel may incur future earnings  gains or losses from changes in market interest rates and commodity prices 
our derivative instruments at december  are recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair market value 
for the year ended december   we used mark to market accounting for our hedge contracts and changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings 
interest rate sensitivity our only financial instrument sensitive to changes in interest rates is our bank debt 
our annual interest costs in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
as the interest rate is variable and reflects current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
the table below shows principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
weighted average interest rates were determined using weighted average interest paid and accrued in december  you should read note to the financial statements for further discussion of our debt that is sensitive to interest rates 
total in s  except interest rates variable rate debt        revolving facility secured average interest rate at december   we had bank loans in the amount of million outstanding at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest  at our election  at i the bank s base rate or ii the libor rate  plus libor margin  but in no event less than 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
assuming no change in the amount outstanding during  the impact on interest expense of a one half of one percent change in the average interest rate above the floor would be approximately  as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value approximates the fair value 
in january   we entered into a month libor fixed interest rate swap contract with bnp paribas 
we will receive fixed day libor interest rates for the month period beginning march  through december  under our credit facility  we may elect an interest rate based upon the agent lender s base lending rate  or the libor rate  plus a margin ranging from to per annum  depending on our borrowing base usage 
the interest rate we are required to pay  including the applicable margin  may never be less than

commodity price sensitivity our major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing domestic price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to the region in which we produce natural gas 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
we expect pricing volatility to continue 
oil prices ranged from a monthly low of per barrel to a monthly high of per barrel during natural gas prices we received during ranged from a monthly low of per mcf to a monthly high of per mcf 
a significant decline in the prices of oil or natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
put options historically  we have not entered into hedging arrangements and have not had any delivery commitments 
while hedging arrangements reduce exposure to losses as a result of unfavorable price changes  they may also limit the ability to benefit from favorable market price changes 
in january   our board determined that parallel should hedge natural gas prices for approximately one half of its natural gas production 
after reviewing alternative strategies  we entered into commodity derivative contracts in the form of put options on natural gas 
these put options create a sales price floor for part of our gasproduction 
we believe put floors provide us with the advantage of no margin requirements  participating in the upside of potential increases in natural gas prices and establishing a minimum selling price at a fixed cost 
however  put floors can also be expensive if markets do not change  and in most cases the protection of a floor will not be immediately realized at current levels 
these derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the following table illustrates our put options  which we entered into in the first quarter of fair value floor at period commodity mcf volume price cost of floor december  april thru october natural gas   april thru october natural gas    expired 
costless collar collars are created by purchasing puts to establish a floor price and then selling a call which establishes a maximum amount the producer will receive for the oil or gas hedged 
calls are sold to offset or reduce the premium paid for buying the put 
we did not have any collars in place during however  in january   we entered into a costless  seven month houston ship channel gas collar 
under terms of the gas collar  we will receive no less than per mmbtu and no greater than per mmbtu for approximately of our estimated natural gas production for the seven month period of april  through october  a majority of our natural gas production is sold based on houston ship channel prices 
a recap for the period of time  number of mmbtu s  and gas prices are as follows houston ship channel gas prices mmbtu of period of time natural gas floor cap april thru october  swaps generally  swaps are an agreement to buy or sell a specified commodity for delivery in the future  but at an agreed fixed price 
swap transactions convert a floating price into a fixed price 
for any particular swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to the hedge party if the reference price for any settlement period is less than the swap price for such hedge  and the hedge party is required to make a payment to the counterparty if the reference price for any settlement period is greater than the swap price for such hedge 
in december   we entered into a month nymex oil swap contract with bnp paribas in conjunction with our acquisition of the fullerton properties 
under terms of the oil swap contract  we will receive certain fixed prices for approximately of our estimated oil production for the month period of april through december  a recap for the period of time  number of barrels and nymex swap prices are as follows barrels of nymex oil period of time oil swap prices april thru december  january thru december  january thru december  in january and february   we entered into additional oil and gas swap contracts with bnp paribas
