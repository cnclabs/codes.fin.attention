item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposures to market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and equity price changes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking analysis 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks  including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and interest rates 
to manage the exposure related to these risks  the company may engage in various derivative transactions in accordance with company established policies 
the company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
moreover  the company enters into financial instrument transactions with either major financial institutions or highly rated counterparties and makes reasonable attempts to diversify transactions among counterparties  thereby limiting exposure to credit and performance related risks 
foreign exchange rate risk the risk of adverse exchange rate fluctuations is mitigated by the fact that there is no concentration of foreign currency exposure 
in addition  the company periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts primarily to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   the principal transactions hedged were accounts receivable  accounts payable and intercompany loans denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the business 
when hedging foreign currency exposures  the company s practice is to hedge such exposures with foreign exchange forward contracts denominated in the same currency and with similar critical terms as the underlying exposure  and therefore  the instruments are effective at generating offsetting changes in the fair value  cash flows or future earnings of the hedged item or transaction 
at december   the currency and net contractual amounts of the company s foreign exchange forward contracts translated into us dollar equivalent amounts were as follows buy pound norwegian sell sterling euro krone us dollar pound sterling euro other the fair value of foreign exchange contracts  based on forward exchange rates at december   exceeded contract values by approximately assuming that year end exchange rates between the underlying currencies of all outstanding foreign exchange contracts and the various hedged currencies were to adversely change by a hypothetical  the change in the fair value of all outstanding contracts at year end would be a decrease of approximately however  since these contracts hedge foreign currency denominated transactions  any change in the fair value of the contracts would be offset by changes in the underlying value of the transaction being hedged 
commodity price risk the company frequently uses natural gas forward contracts and swaps to reduce the volatility of natural gas costs used for utility purposes at certain of its facilities 
these contracts typically correlate highly to the actual purchases of the commodity and have the effect of securing predetermined prices that the company pays for the underlying commodity 
while these contracts are primarily structured to limit the company s exposure to increases in commodity prices  they can also limit the potential benefit the company might have otherwise received from decreases in commodity prices 
at december   the company had of natural gas forward contracts with january through december delivery dates outstanding and no natural gas swaps outstanding 
at december   based on year end nymex prices  the company had net unrealized gains on its natural gas forward contracts of assuming that year end prices were to decrease by a hypothetical  the above gain would be reduced by approximately interest rate risk at december   the outstanding borrowings of the company consisted primarily of fixed rate long term debt  which had a carrying value of  a face value of and a fair value  based on dealer quoted values  of approximately assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt  but do not impact the carrying value  earnings or cash flows 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would not change  however  the fair market value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately  but this change would not impact the carrying value 
equity price risk in connection with the company s stock repurchase program  the company selectively utilizes freestanding put option contracts that are indexed to the company s stock and entitle the holder to sell shares of the company s common stock to the company at specified exercise prices 
at december   the company had  put options outstanding that expire in march and entitle the holders to sell an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock to the company at an exercise price of per share 
the company received aggregate premiums of approximately on the sale of such put options 
the put options outstanding at december   had exercise prices that were per share higher than the company s closing stock price as of that date 
assuming that the company s stock price were to decrease by a hypothetical from its year end closing price  the company could be subject to settling the options at a cost of which would more than offset the aggregate premiums received on the sale of such put options 
for further information on the company s financial instruments  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other outlook the company expects full year diluted earnings per share to be up approximately over the full year adjusted earnings per share of for overall  the company expects continuing economic uncertainty and does not expect an economic recovery heading into higher raw material and energy costs as well as higher employee benefit and insurance costs are expected 
however  the continuance of the company s operational excellence programs  initiatives in new product technology  and geographical expansion are expected to provide benefits that will exceed these higher costs 
in the water and industrial process chemicals segment  modest sales increases of about are expected  when compared with sales  as a result of new products and geographical expansion 
operating earnings are expected to grow about with the increased sales and the ongoing impact of the company s operational excellence initiatives more than offsetting the higher costs of raw materials  employee benefits and insurance 
in the performance products segment  the company anticipates overall market growth to be flat 
however  based on international expansion and new products  the company expects sales to increase by about 
the resulting profit and leverage from the higher sales and additional operational excellence programs are expected to increase earnings by approximately over in the specialty materials segment  the forecast of build rates for commercial aircraft is down from levels  and growth from new business will not be enough to offset the decline in the commercial aircraft build rates 
the company believes that its military and non aerospace business will grow 
however  the expectation is for sales in to be down overall by about 
the company expects full year earnings to be about lower than  reflecting the lower sales  a less favorable product mix and increased employee benefits and insurance costs 
in the building block chemicals segment  demand in is expected to remain at the improved levels experienced in the second half of  resulting in most of cytec s plants operating at full capacity 
on the cost side  the company expects propylene to be essentially flat with costs and natural gas to be in the range of to per mmbtu  after giving effect to the company s forward contracts 
the net result of these factors is an expected operating profit in that would be approximately double the operating profit in based on the above full year assumptions  the company expects first quarter net earnings to be in the range of to per diluted share 
the company will update the outlook when it reports its first quarter   operating results 
there can be no assurances that sales or earnings will develop in the manner projected 
actual results may differ materially

the areas discussed below involve the use of significant judgment in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and changes in the estimates and assumptions used may impact future results of operations and financial condition 
environmental it is the company s policy to accrue  and charge against earnings  environmental cleanup costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount is reasonably estimable 
as assessments and cleanups proceed  these accruals are reviewed periodically and adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
these accruals can change substantially due to such factors as additional information on the nature or extent of contamination  methods of remediation required  changes in the apportionment of costs among responsible parties and other actions by governmental agencies or private parties 
cash expenditures often lag by a number of years behind the period in which an accrual is recorded 
retirement plans the company sponsors defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the postretirement plans provide medical and life insurance benefits to retirees who meet minimum age and service requirements 
the key determinants of the accumulated benefit obligations for these plans apbo are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and  for the postretirement benefit plans  the healthcare cost trend rate 
the healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the reported amounts for the postretirement apbo and related expense 
the discount rate used to determine the value of liabilities has a significant effect on the apbo  pension minimum liability recognition and expense 
for example  a change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the discount rate in would change postretirement benefit expense by approximately and pension expense by approximately the expected return on plan assets has a significant effect on expense  particularly for pensions 
a change of a quarter percentage point in either direction in the expected return on plan assets would change net postretirement expense by approximately and pension expense by approximately impairment of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets as described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  intangible assets  subject to amortization  and long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually by comparing the carrying value of the company s reporting units to their fair value 
these evaluations involve amounts that are based on management s best estimates and judgments 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company is not aware of reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being estimated that would have a material impact on these assessments for impairment
