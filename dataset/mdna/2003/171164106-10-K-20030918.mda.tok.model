see note  notes to consolidated financial statements  item of this annual report on form k  for information regarding our business segments 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note  notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time prescriptions are shipped to or picked up by the patient 
we participate in various third party provider networks and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of these networks  the amount to be paid for our products is determined or adjudicated through electronic connections with these networks at the time of sale 
however  for certain third party providers and state medicaid programs for which there is no electronic adjudication process available at the time of sale  we bill a standard list price versus a known contracted price and then simultaneously determine an appropriate estimate for expected payor discount based on our reimbursement history for each payor class 
this reimbursement history is updated quarterly 
revenue is then reported net of the estimated payor discounts and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from third party payors the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  prescription benefits managers  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and to a lesser extent from individual patients 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected for reasons other than discounts taken by payors at the time of payment 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts and historical write off experience 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
bad debt expense was million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
we believe this decrease reflects improvements in our billing and collection processes 
however  subsequent changes in estimates could be unfavorable 
goodwill we have million of goodwill on our balance sheet at june  the annual impairment tests of these assets under fas involves the use of a third party valuation firm and requires estimates of future cash flows by reporting unit 
we also review the carrying value of these assets whenever there are any events or circumstances that indicate the potential for impairment 
if an impairment is determined  the carrying values of these assets will be reduced to fair value

fiscal revenues by disease compared to fiscal as follows fiscal year of of dollar amounts in thousands total total change hiv aids   transplant   other disease states   total   the mail service segment revenue for fiscal grew to million from million in fiscal this growth was due to the addition of new biotech injectable patients from several payors and price inflation 
payor reimbursements from aetna represented and of our mail service revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
except for aetna  no other private payor accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal and the retail segment revenue for fiscal grew to million from million in fiscal this increase was due to continued additions of new patients at existing stores and a combination of increased anti viral medication volume bolstered by increased post transplant drug sales 
we plan to continue our expansion of retail product offerings beyond our hiv aids focus  to include post transplant certain biotech injectable medications

gross profit and gross margin total gross profit dollars increased million or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal gross margins as a percentage of revenue improved slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal mail service margins as a percentage of revenue increased slightly from the year ago period due to a stabilization in pricing pressures in markets we serve  improved purchasing programs  and a change in product mix toward higher margin products 
aetna represented and of our mail service margins for fiscal and  respectively 
retail margins as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly from the year ago period primarily due to a reduction in reimbursement rates by several payors  particularly state medicaid programs  in selected markets we serve 
a single uncontracted private payor represented and of our retail margins for fiscal and  respectively 
we expect this private payor to reduce its reimbursement rate in fiscal  which will result in lower gross margins in the retail segment 
we anticipate that payors will continue to exert downward pressure on the prices we will be able to charge as payors continue to seek containment of healthcare costs  which will negatively affect margins in the future 
we are working to offset this pricing pressure in a number of ways  including sales and marketing efforts to direct more profitable medications into both the retail and mail service segments  and enhanced programs with manufacturers  wholesalers  and group purchasing organizations to reduce product costs 
operating expenses our operating expenses include selling and marketing  general and administrative g a  and bad debt expenses

looking forward to fiscal  we expect our combined federal and state tax rate to approximate

the acquired businesses include four retail pharmacies of american prescription providers app acquired in february  and a single location pharmacy in sherman oaks  california oaks acquired in april  in the retail segment  and the organ transplant pharmacy of sangstat medical sangstat acquired in april  in the mail service segment 
overall  these three acquisitions contributed approximately million or of our million year over year growth excluding the disposed businesses  as noted below

fiscal year dollar amounts in thousands change mail service segment on going business   disposed businesses  total mail order   retail segment on going business   disposed businesses total retail   total company   the mail service segment revenue grew year over year  despite the september  sale of the segment s hsm business and the closure of its diabetes service centers 
excluding these businesses in both years  the year over year growth was 
this growth was due to several factors  including the addition of new biotech injectable patients from several payors  the april  sangstat acquisition  and price inflation 
the sangstat acquisition contributed approximately million of the growth in year over year revenue 
excluding the sangstat acquisition  the rate of revenue growth slowed to approximately in fiscal compared to in fiscal  due to new patients from the contract with aetna that became effective july   unfavorable retention of organ transplant patients  and product shortages for enbrel r and the hepatitis c drug peg intron r

except for aetna  no other private payor accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal and the retail segment revenue grew for the year due to continued additions of new patients at existing stores and the full year benefit of the acquisition of the app and oaks specialty pharmacies 
the newly acquired stores accounted for approximately million of our growth in the on going business  while same store revenue accounted for the remainder of the revenue growth  with a increase for the year

liquidity and capital resources as of june   we had million of working capital  compared to million as of june  during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
the average days sales outstanding dso of our accounts receivable improved from days at june   to days at june  faster payment from our larger payors and active collection efforts led to this improvement 
this improvement in dso generated million in cash during the year 
we expect our receivables to perform at or better than the current days sales outstanding in fiscal the average days inventory on hand also improved from days at june   to days at june  this improvement partially offset the growth in inventory required to support the business growth 
we expect our inventory to perform at or below the current days on hand in fiscal working capital generated from higher trade payables provided a million source of cash for the year 
approximately million of cash was used in investing activities during fiscal for purchases of property and equipment 
we had no outstanding borrowings as of fiscal year end and shareholders equity as of fiscal year end and was million and million  respectively

the line of credit expires in april we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  line of credit  and cash provided by operating activities should allow us to meet foreseeable cash requirements and provide the flexibility to fund future working capital growth 
however  we would need to seek additional debt or equity financing beyond our current million line of credit to fund any major business acquisitions or capital spending projects 
we expect our capital project requirements to be between to million in fiscal our future contractual commitments consist entirely of payments due under operating leases are as follows less than one to three four to five after five in thousands total one year years years years total contractual cash obligations    restricted stock grants in august  the compensation committee of the board of directors granted  restricted shares of common stock to our officers under our stock incentive plan

in october   of these shares were cancelled 
the remaining  restricted shares vested on march   as provided by the acceleration provision and we recognized compensation expense of million during fiscal new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
prior guidance required that a liability for an exit cost be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of statement did not have any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued statement  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
the statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the previous disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported financial results and requires these disclosures in interim financial information 
we continue to account for stock based employee compensation under apb opinion but have adopted the new disclosure requirements of statement impact of inflation changes in prices charged by biopharmaceutical manufacturers for the drugs we dispense  along with increasing labor costs  freight and supply costs and other overhead expenses  affect our cost of revenue and general and administrative expenses 
historically  we have been able to pass a portion of the effect of such increases to the payor and patient pursuant to automatic price adjustments made under our payor contracts 
as a result  changes due to inflation have not had significant adverse effects on our operations
