table of contents overview we have incurred net losses in each quarter since inception 
as of april   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended april   and  respectively 
these losses resulted from charges related to the impairment of certain intangible and long lived assets  the amortization of deferred stock compensation and goodwill and significant costs incurred in the development and sale of our products and services 
additionally  we experienced a significant decline in the demand for our products during the years ended april  and  which resulted in declining revenues during such years 
we believe these declines in revenues resulted from the weakening global economy and a corresponding reduction in information technology spending 
unless there are positive changes in current macroeconomic conditions  we expect that the lowered levels of demand experienced in fiscal and will continue throughout fiscal as a result  we expect to incur additional operating losses and continued negative cash flows from operations through at least fiscal we have reduced our operating expenses to accommodate lower revenues  and we believe that the losses in fiscal will be substantially lower than prior years 
our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as a prediction of future performance 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an ongoing basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  warranty costs  excess inventory and purchase commitments  investments  intangible assets  lease losses and restructuring accruals  income taxes and contingencies based on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe the accounting policies described below  among others  are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations revenue recognition and related allowances  warranty reserves  inventory and related reserves  restructuring liabilities  and contingencies 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment  assuming that evidence of an arrangement between the customer and us exists  the fee to the customer is fixed or determinable and collectability of the sales price is probable  unless the company has future obligations for installation or must obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is deferred until these obligations are met 
revenues related to shipments to our distributors who have certain stock rotation rights are deferred until a point of sale report is received from the distributor confirming that our products have been sold to a reseller or an end user 
maintenance contract revenue is initially deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
probability of collection is assessed on a customer by customer basis 
our customers are subjected to a credit 
table of contents review process that evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay for our products and services 
if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection is not probable based upon our review process  revenue is recognized upon cash receipt 
during the course of fiscal and  we deferred certain revenue based on this criteria and revenue from certain customers was recognized based upon cash receipts 
we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer solvency  current economic and geographic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of such allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty reserves 
we accrue for warranty expenses at the time revenue is recognized and maintain a warranty accrual for estimated future warranty obligations based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated costs and sales volumes 
if actual warranty expenses are greater than those projected  additional reserves and other charges against earnings may be required 
if actual warranty expenses are less than projected  prior reserves could be reduced providing a positive impact on our reported results 
see item  note summary of significant accounting policies guarantees of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
inventory and related reserves 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in addition  we evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
in assessing the ultimate recoverability of inventories  we are required to make estimates regarding future customer demand and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments  and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional reserves and other charges against earnings may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than projected  prior reserves for excess and obsolete inventories could be reduced providing a positive impact on our reported results 
see item  note summary of significant accounting policies inventories of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
restructuring liabilities 
during the years ended april  and  as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in customer it spending rates  we implemented restructuring programs  which included reductions in workforce and a consolidation of facilities 
the restructuring liabilities recorded in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k include various assumptions such as the time period over which the facilities will be vacant  expected sublease terms  and expected sublease rates 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically and may result in a substantial change to restructuring expense should different conditions prevail than were anticipated in original management estimates 
these conditions may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  sublease rates  and lease termination 
in this regard  due to its financial difficulties  the tenant in one of our sunnyvale  california facilities surrendered the premises and vacated the property in january this facility is currently vacant and available for subleasing 
as a result  we revised and increased our estimated restructuring liabilities for abandoned space during fiscal based on new market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
should operating lease rental rates decline  should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease our facility  or should our other tenant terminate its sublease  adjustments to the restructuring accruals may be necessary in future periods based upon the then current actual events and circumstances 
see item  note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
contingencies 
management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred and our management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the determination of the probability of an 
table of contents unfavorable outcome and the amount and range of loss in the event of an unfavorable outcome  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from the remaining pending litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the probability and the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates  if necessary 
such revisions in our estimates of potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
see item  note litigation of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
results of operations net sales 
net sales decreased to million for the fiscal year ended april  from million in fiscal  and from million in fiscal these decreases in fiscal and were primarily attributable to fewer unit sales and a purchasing trend towards our lower end systems  which have lower average sales prices than our higher end systems  partially offset by increased service and other product revenue 
as a result of our focus on increasing the use of indirect distribution channels  one of our distributors accounted for of our net sales during the year ended april  no customer accounted for more than of our net sales during the years ended april  and net sales for the year ended april  were million from the united states  or of net sales  million from europe  or of net sales  and million from asia  or of net sales 
net sales for the year ended april  were million from the united states  or of net sales  million from europe  or of net sales  and million from asia  or of net sales 
net sales for the year ended april  were million from the united states  or of net sales  million from europe  or of net sales  and million from asia  or of net sales 
net sales for the year ended april  were million from our proxysg products  or of net sales  million from our legacy products  or of net sales  and million from services  or of net sales 
net sales for the year ended april  were million from our proxysg products  or of net sales  million from our legacy products  or of net sales  and million from services  or of net sales 
unless macroeconomic conditions improve sooner than anticipated  our visibility of the near term demand for our products is limited  however  we currently anticipate that we may see modest net sales growth in the next several quarters 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million and million in fiscal and  respectively  from million in fiscal these decreases in fiscal and were primarily due to lower sales volumes  as discussed above  and offset by increases in our maintenance revenue  which has relatively fixed expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to and in fiscal and  respectively  from in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal was the result of i lower fixed manufacturing and support costs in fiscal as a result of restructuring programs initiated in prior fiscal years  ii a million reduction in our warranty reserves as a result of the reliability of our new products  specifically our proxysg series product line  who s reliability exceeded our initial expectations based on our experience with prior products and iii a million reduction in our inventory reserves because customer demand for our proxysg series products exceeded the initial estimates we made when we established reserves for excess and obsolete inventory of this product line 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal was the result of a decrease in cost of goods sold due to lower direct material costs and reduced fixed manufacturing and support costs  offset by a million increase in our inventory reserves as a result of the changes in market demand which began in fiscal  as discussed further below  and continued into fiscal during fiscal  we increased our inventory reserves by million because inventories were built up in anticipation of projected sales volumes that never materialized as a result of the sharp deterioration in 
table of contents macroeconomic conditions that caused customers to defer or delay capital expenditures on information technology 
our gross profit has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors  including competition  fluctuations in demand for our products  the timing and size of customer orders and product implementations  the mix of direct and indirect sales  the mix and average selling prices of products  new product introductions and enhancements  component costs  manufacturing costs and product configuration 
if actual orders do not match our forecasts  as we have experienced in the past  we may have excess or inadequate inventory of some materials and components or we could incur cancellation charges or penalties  which would increase our costs or prevent or delay product shipments and could seriously harm our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits and prototype and testing equipment costs 
research and development expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses from fiscal to fiscal in absolute dollars is primarily attributable to a decrease in staffing 
additionally  in fiscal  we received million in tax refunds for fiscal and scientific research and experimental development expenditures related to our research and development office in canada  which were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense 
the increase in research and development expenses from fiscal to fiscal in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to higher staffing levels throughout until the reduction in headcount in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as discussed further below 
research and development headcount decreased to at april  from at april   and from at april  the decrease in research and development headcount at april  and  is a result of the restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as discussed further below 
as a percentage of net sales  research and development expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal occurred despite lower revenue due to the significant reduction in research and development headcount in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as discussed further below 
the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales from fiscal year to occurred because we continued to invest significantly in research and development projects during much of fiscal  while revenues were declining 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we significantly reduced research and development headcount in light of continued lower revenues 
should growth in demand for our products resume  and after we realize potential efficiencies within our research and development organization  we expect to increase our research and development expenses in absolute dollars and increase headcount within the research and development organization to provide for the development of new products 
however  should sales decline further in future periods  we may implement additional cost reduction programs to further reduce our research and development expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  commissions  advertising and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal these decreases in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars were related to reductions in headcount 
sales and marketing headcount decreased to at april  from at april  and at april  as a percentage of net sales  sales and marketing expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  which was a decrease from in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was not significant 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales in fiscal occurred despite lower revenue due to our cost reduction programs 
should growth in demand for our products resume  and after we realize potential efficiencies within our sales and marketing organization  we expect to increase our sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars in an effort to expand domestic and international markets  introduce new products and establish and expand new distribution channels 
however  should sales decline further in future periods  we may implement additional cost reduction programs to further reduce our sales and marketing expenses 

table of contents general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal these decreases in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars during fiscal and were related to decreased headcount 
general and administrative headcount decreased to at april  from at april   and from at april  as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal  which was an increase from in fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was a result of the restructuring plan implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was a result of the decline in sales experienced in fiscal compared to fiscal and an increase in the provision for bad debt expense of million in fiscal should growth in demand for our products resume  and after we have realized potential efficiencies within our current general and administrative organization  we expect to increase general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and increase headcount to manage expanding operations and facilities 
however  should sales decline further in future periods  we may implement additional cost reduction programs to further reduce our general and administrative expenses 
stock compensation 
stock compensation expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal stock compensation expense reflects the amortization of non cash deferred stock compensation  as well as charges associated with stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services and modifications to stock based awards for certain departed employees 
stock compensation expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and as a result of decreased headcount and decreased amortization of deferred stock compensation for remaining employees 
our policy is to amortize such deferred stock compensation using a graded method 
graded amortization methods result in greater amortization in earlier years  and most of our deferred stock compensation was recorded in connection with our november initial public offering  certain below market option grants in fiscal and unvested options assumed in our december acquisition of entera 
in addition  the fiscal expense includes a deferred stock compensation charge of million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain unvested stock options held by the former chairman of our board of directors 
based on the options granted through april   we have a remaining balance of million in deferred stock compensation 
this amount will be fully amortized by fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we discovered that we had overstated our non cash stock compensation expense for the quarters ended july   october  and january   resulting in a net loss for those periods that was slightly lower than previously reported 
the stock compensation expense for these periods was lower than previously reported by approximately million in the third quarter of fiscal  million in the second quarter of fiscal and million in the first quarter of fiscal this overstatement related to non cash stock compensation expenses for certain employees who separated from us prior to being fully vested in their stock options 
we amortize deferred stock compensation using a graded method  and we have not adjusted compensation expense related to separated employees in the period of separation to the amount that was contractually vested as of the separation date 
after adjusting the results in these prior quarters to correctly reflect the lower expense  our net loss was reduced to million  or per share  for the third quarter of fiscal  million  or per share  for the second quarter of fiscal and million  or per share  for the first quarter of fiscal we also discovered that we had overstated our stock compensation expense for the years ended april  and by amounts that were immaterial to the consolidated financial results previously reported for those periods 
goodwill amortization 
there was no goodwill amortization for the company in fiscal  a decrease from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in was primarily attributable to the cumulative million asset impairment charges during fiscal and that ultimately decreased our entire goodwill balance to zero 
furthermore  purchase accounting for the acquisition of entera was completed during fiscal  resulting in a million reduction of goodwill 
for additional discussion regarding goodwill impairment charges  refer to the impairment of assets section below 

table of contents acquired in process research and development 
we recorded a non recurring  non cash million charge in fiscal for the value of in process research and development acquired in the entera transaction  which relates to in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future use in our development activities 
no such charges were recorded in fiscal years or there were two projects included in the in process research and development for entera 
the efforts required to complete the acquired in process research and development included the completion of all planning  designing and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design requirements  including functions  features and technical performance requirements 
the value of the acquired in process research and development was computed using a discounted cash flow analysis rate of on the anticipated income stream of the related product revenues 
the discounted cash flow analysis was based on our forecast of future revenues  cost of revenues and operating expenses related to the products and technologies purchased from entera 
the calculation of value was then adjusted to reflect only the value creation efforts of entera prior to the close of the acquisition 
at the time of the acquisition  the products were approximately and complete  respectively  with approximately million and million in estimated costs remaining  respectively 
the majority of these costs were incurred by the end of fiscal the acquired in process research and development was expensed in the period the transaction was consummated 
restructuring charges 
as discussed further under reorganization plans below  and in item  note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we recorded charges of approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  related to facilities closure costs  lease abandonment costs  certain employee severance costs and contract termination costs 
we revised certain of our estimates and recorded an additional million of restructuring charges in fiscal impairment of assets 
as discussed further under asset impairment below  and in item  note impairment of assets of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  in fiscal we performed impairment assessments of our long lived assets and determined that enterprise level goodwill associated with the springbank and entera acquisitions was impaired 
as a result  impairment charges of million and million were recorded in fiscal and  respectively  to write our enterprise level goodwill net book value down to zero as of april  additionally  we recorded write downs related to certain leasehold improvements of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the leasehold improvement write downs related to two research and development facilities  which were closed and or relocated in fiscal and in connection with our restructuring and reorganization activities 
we recorded no write downs of long lived assets during the year ended april  interest and other income expense 
interest income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal these decreases were primarily attributable to lower cash balances and lower interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes  which is composed entirely of foreign corporate income taxes  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  which was an increase from million in fiscal the foreign corporate income taxes are a function of our international expansion and the establishment of branches and subsidiaries in various jurisdictions 
the provision for income taxes is based on income taxes on profits the foreign operations generated for services provided to us 
we have incurred losses from inception through fiscal we believe that  based on the history of such losses and other factors  it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize our deferred tax assets 
therefore  a full valuation allowance has been recorded at april  and the valuation allowance increased decreased by million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents as of april   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which begin to expire in  if not utilized 
we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million  which will begin to expire in fiscal year  if not utilized 
we also had federal and california research and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  which will begin to expire in fiscal  if not utilized 
utilization of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such annual limitations could result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
the events that may cause ownership changes in our net operating loss include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than over a three year period 
acquisitions springbank networks  inc on june   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of springbank networks  inc springbank  a privately held company organized to develop content management technologies 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the acquisition date 
since june   the results of operations of springbank have been included in our consolidated statements of operations 
purchase consideration totaled approximately million and included approximately  shares of our common stock  approximately million of assumed liabilities and approximately million in transaction costs 
the entire million purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
for further discussion regarding goodwill  refer to the asset impairment section below 
entera  inc on december   we completed the acquisition of entera  inc entera  a company that develops standards based streaming content distribution and management technologies  in a stock for stock merger transaction accounted for as a purchase 
the purchase consideration was approximately million consisting of approximately  shares of our common stock with a fair value of approximately million  the assumption of approximately  outstanding stock options with a fair value of approximately million  and approximately million in transaction costs 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired was valued at million 
of this excess  million was allocated to goodwill  million was allocated to deferred compensation  and million was allocated to in process research and development 
for further discussion regarding goodwill  refer to the asset impairment section below 
stock compensation we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million for the year ended april  we did not record any deferred stock compensation in fiscal and our deferred stock compensation balance generally represents the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the underlying stock on the date stock options are granted to employees 
however  we have also completed other stock based transactions that impact deferred stock compensation  such as acquisitions in which the outstanding options of the acquired entity are assumed 
deferred stock compensation is amortized to stock compensation expense over the option vesting period  generally two to four years  or recognized immediately if there is no vesting period 
in addition to amortization of deferred stock compensation  stock compensation expense includes charges associated with stock options and warrants granted to non employees for services and modifications to stock based awards for certain departed employees 
we recorded stock compensation expense of approximately million  million and million for the years ended april   and we may record additional deferred stock compensation and or stock compensation expense in the future if management decides to grant below market stock options  assume outstanding options in any future acquisitions  modify outstanding stock awards subsequent to their date of grant  or enter into other transactions that may require the recognition of additional compensation 
we expect stock compensation expense  which is primarily attributable to amortization of deferred stock compensation  to impact our reported results through fiscal 
table of contents reorganization plans in february  our board of directors approved a restructuring program to significantly reduce our operating expenses and further align our organization with market conditions  future revenue expectations and our planned future product direction at that time 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we implemented a reduction in workforce of approximately employees 
we accrued approximately million in the fourth quarter ended april   comprised of employee severance costs of approximately million  facilities closure and lease abandonment costs of approximately million and contract termination costs of approximately million 
all employees were notified of their termination prior to april  estimates related to sublease costs and income were based on assumptions regarding sublease rates and the time required to locate sub lessees  which were derived from market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and to the extent that these assumptions materially change due to changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expense for the abandoned facility will be adjusted 
in july  one of our facilities in sunnyvale  california was subleased for the remainder of the lease term at a rental price that was consistent with our initial estimates 
our facility in redmond  washington was subleased in december for the remainder of the term of the original lease at a rental price consistent with our initial estimates 
due to its financial difficulties  the tenant in sunnyvale  california surrendered the premises and vacated the property in january the facility in sunnyvale  california is currently vacant and available for subleasing 
as a result  we revised and increased our estimated restructuring accruals for abandoned space by million during fiscal based on new market trend information provided by a commercial real estate broker 
we also reduced our estimates for contract termination costs by million during fiscal  as we were able to negotiate lower settlement amounts than originally estimated 
as of april   substantially all severance costs related to domestic and international employees had been paid  and approximately million remained accrued for lease abandonment and contract termination costs 
the lease abandonment costs will be paid over the respective lease terms through in august  our board of directors approved a restructuring program in response to the continued economic slowdown that negatively impacted first quarter of fiscal demand for our products as potential customers deferred spending on internet and intranet infrastructure 
in order to streamline our cost structure and better position us for planned growth  we implemented a reduction in workforce of approximately positions 
we incurred million in restructuring costs in the quarter ended october   which included employee severance costs of approximately million and certain contract termination costs of approximately million 
as of april   these severance payments and contract termination payments were completed 
in february  we announced a reorganization plan and incurred million in reorganization costs in the quarter ended april  to complete this effort  which primarily included employee severance costs of approximately million to reduce our workforce by employees and certain contract termination costs of approximately million 
this plan was instituted in response to an unanticipated economic slowdown that negatively impacted third and fourth quarter fiscal demand for our products  as potential customers deferred spending on internet and intranet infrastructure 
the reorganization plan was designed to more closely align spending with our sales projections 
as of april   these severance payments and contract termination payments were completed 

table of contents changes in our restructuring accruals are as follows in thousands abandoned space severance related contract termination and other total balances as of april  provision for restructuring charges cash payments balances as of april  cash payments additions reversals balances as of april  less current portion which is included in other accrued liabilities long term accrued restructuring we cannot assure you that our most recent restructuring program will achieve all of the expense reductions and other benefits that we anticipate 
in addition  anticipated savings from the reduced headcount or facility consolidations have been  and may in the future be  mitigated by changes in circumstances or subsequent increases in headcount and facilities related to our operating requirements 
see item  note restructuring charges of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for further discussion 
asset impairment in fiscal and  we determined that certain enterprise level goodwill recorded in connection with our springbank and entera acquisitions was not fully recoverable 
our impairment assessments were performed because i our stock price had declined significantly and the net book value of our assets significantly exceeded our market capitalization  and ii industry growth rates had declined significantly 
the overall decline in industry growth rates indicated that this trend might continue for an indefinite period 
as a result  we recorded impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively  to reduce goodwill to its estimated fair value based on the market value method 
the estimated of fair value was based upon our average market capitalization  which was calculated using our average closing stock price surrounding each respective measurement date 
as of april   goodwill was fully written off 
additionally  we recorded write downs related primarily to certain leasehold improvements of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the leasehold improvement write downs related to two research and development facilities  which were closed and or relocated in fiscal and in connection with our restructuring and reorganization activities 
we recorded no write downs of long lived assets during the year ended april  liquidity and capital resources from our inception in march  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through private sales of preferred stock  bank loans  equipment leases  and an initial public offering of our common stock 
as of april   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term investments  million in restricted investments and million in working capital 
net cash used in our operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we used cash primarily to fund our net losses from operations 
we implemented a strategic restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of our fiscal with the goal of reducing our net cash used in 
table of contents operating activities beginning with the first quarter of fiscal  and we continued to make reductions in fiscal which have further lowered the cash used in our operating activities 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal includes million of payments against accrued restructuring liabilities related to terminated and vacated facilities leases 
we expect to make payments of approximately million against our accrued restructuring liabilities over the next months 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to sales of short term investments of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal was primarily due to cash acquired in business acquisitions of approximately million and sales of short term investments of approximately million  offset by purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
in the future  we expect that any cash in excess of current requirements will continue to be invested in short term investment grade  interest bearing securities 
during the years ended april   and  our capital expenditures consisted primarily of purchases of computer equipment and software  furniture and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the net cash provided by our financing activities during fiscal  and was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of common stock of million  million and million  respectively 
our contractual operating lease commitments as of april  for the next five years were as follows year ending april  abandoned in use total total minimum lease payments we lease certain equipment and office facilities under various noncancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through the facility leases generally require us to pay operating costs  including property taxes  insurance and maintenance  and contain scheduled rent increases and certain other rent escalation clauses 
rent expense is reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
as of april   we did not have any other significant contractual obligations or commercial commitments 
as of april   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities  nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we have suffered recurring losses from operations and currently project that such losses will continue into fiscal our current business plan for reflects continued initiatives to increase revenue  reduce overhead  and realize the benefit of reductions in employee headcount and occupancy costs  and such business 
table of contents plan projects that the amount of our quarterly net loss will decline from quarter to quarter with net income projected to begin in late fiscal as a result  our cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances as of april  are projected to be sufficient to fund the excess of expenses over revenue and allow us to continue as a going concern at least through april  furthermore  in our review of our operating requirements  we determined that  even with a reduction of fiscal revenues in excess of from fiscal  we would still have sufficient working capital to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least april  however  if revenues decrease below that level without further expense reduction  or if cash is used for unanticipated purposes  we may need additional capital sooner than expected 
although we cannot guarantee that planned results will be obtained in fiscal or that sufficient debt or equity capital will be available to us under acceptable terms  if at all  we believe that our planned revenue and expense assumptions can be realized 
however  if we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flow from operations or in raising additional capital when required in sufficient amounts and on terms acceptable to us  we could be unable to continue our operations 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders will be reduced 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of variable interest entities that function to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
fin applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity 
we believe we have no investment in or contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and  therefore  the adoption of fin did not have any impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  if we enter into any such arrangement with a variable interest entity in the future  our consolidated financial position or results of operations may be adversely impacted 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure

 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  statement requires more prominent disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported results of operations  including per share amounts  in annual and interim financial statements 
the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
were effective immediately upon issuance in december as of april   we have no immediate plans to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee

in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no

 accounting for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  by extending the period in which expenses related to restructuring activities are reported 
a commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets is no longer sufficient to record a one time charge for most restructuring activities 
instead  companies record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value 
in addition  the resultant liabilities are subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
sfas no 
was effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of sfas no 
 and liabilities that a company previously recorded under eitf issue no 
are grandfathered

on february   we adopted the provision in eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  dealing with consideration from a vendor to a reseller under cooperative advertising and other arrangements 
this provision of eitf issue no 
states that consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendor s products or services is presumed to be a reduction of the selling price of the vendor s products or services  unless the vendor receives an identifiable benefit in return for the consideration and can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
if the amount of consideration paid by the vendor exceeds the estimated fair value of the benefit received  the excess amount is to be recorded by the vendor as a reduction of revenues 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are subject to certain market risks  including changes in exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposures to exchange and interest rate risks  and we are not a party to any risk management transactions 
we do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
as of april   we had approximately million invested primarily in certificates of deposit and fixed rate  short term corporate and us government debt securities  which are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market us interest rates increase 
we maintain a strict investment policy  which is intended to ensure 
table of contents the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
the following table presents notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of april  total fair value in thousands cash equivalents fixed rate average rate investments fixed rate average rate total investment securities average rate foreign currency exchange rate risk we develop products in the united states and sell them throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since all of our sales are currently made in united states dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the fiscal years  and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of north america 
in contrast  substantially all of the expenses of operating our foreign subsidiaries are incurred in foreign currencies 
specifically  the exposure includes intercompany loans  and third party sales or payments 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
however  we do not consider the market risk associated with our international operations to be material 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes
