item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general during the three year period ended december   the company continued to experience growth both internally and through acquisitions 
on november   the company acquired certain assets of crown crafts 
under the agreement  the company paid approximately million in cash for substantially all of the fixed assets and inventory of the division 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of dal tile  a leading manufacturer and distributor of ceramic tile in the united states  for approximately  million  consisting of approximately million shares of the company s common stock  options to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock and million in cash 
the company s common stock and options were valued at million based on the measurement date stock price of per share million and the estimated fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model million 
the transaction will be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the results of operations of dal tile have been included in the company s consolidated financial statements from march  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired of approximately  million was recorded as goodwill 
the primary reasons for the acquisition included the ability to combine mohawk s current efforts in the hard flooring business with dal tile s larger  more established ceramic tile and natural stone business  the opportunity to use mohawk and dal tile s existing distribution channels to increase sales of both carpets and hard floorcoverings  the potential to improve service and reduce costs by adding dal tile s distribution network to mohawk s logistical and distribution system  the potential to reduce manufacturing costs and increase quality by identifying manufacturing best practices  and the potential to reduce general  administrative  overhead and other miscellaneous costs by spreading fixed costs over a larger business 
effective november   the company entered into an agreement with congoleum corporation  inc  to become a national distributor of their vinyl products 
this agreement was the final step  which gave the company access to a complete line of soft and hard floor covering products to supply to customers throughout the united states 
the primary categories of the floorcovering industry include carpet and rugs  ceramic tile  vinyl and rubber  hardwood and laminate 
compound average growth rates in units sold measured in square yards for all categories  except the vinyl and rubber category  for the period from through have exceeded the growth rate for both the gross domestic product of the united states and housing starts over the same period 
during this period  the compound average growth rate was for carpet and rugs  for ceramic tile  for vinyl and rubber and for hardwood 
laminate  which is a relatively new product  experienced a compound average growth rate of from through although beginning from a smaller base  the growth rates for hard floorcoverings may indicate increasing consumer preference for these products for certain applications 
in response to this increasing demand  the company has increased its distribution of hard surface products  including ceramic tile  vinyl  hardwood and laminate 
the acquisition of dal tile provides a unique opportunity to help the company achieve its strategic goal of becoming one of the world s leading floorcovering manufacturers and distributors 
as a result of the dal tile acquisition  the company has determined that it has two operating segments  the mohawk segment and the dal tile segment 
the mohawk segment is comprised of all the product lines and operations that were the company s prior to the dal tile acquisition 
the dal tile segment is comprised of the dal tile product lines and operations 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on its consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and reported amounts of expenses in the company s consolidated statements of earnings during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to  among other things  future economic factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
the sec issued disclosure guidance for accounting policies that management believes are most critical 
the sec defines these critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the company believes the following accounting policies require it to use more significant judgments and estimates in preparing its consolidated financial statements and could represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec 
the company discusses its significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when goods are shipped  which is when legal title passes to the customer 
the company provides allowances for expected cash discounts  returns  claims and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience and periodic evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market net realizable value 
cost is determined using the last in  first out method lifo predominantly within the mohawk segment  which matches current costs with current revenues  and the first in  first out method fifo  which is used to value inventory within the dal tile segment 
inventories on hand are compared against anticipated future usage  which is a function of historical usage  in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities 
actual results could differ from assumptions used to value obsolete or excessive inventory and additional reserves may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment tests are based on determining the fair value of the specified reporting units based on management judgments and assumptions using estimated future cash flows 
these judgments and assumptions could materially change the value of the specified reporting units and  therefore  could materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in the tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
additionally  taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with the company s tax treatment of certain items  and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward 
accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws  rules and regulations  each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner 
results of operations year ended december   as compared with year ended december  net sales for the year ended december   were  million  reflecting an increase of  million  or approximately  over the  million reported in the year ended december  the increased net sales were attributable to the dal tile acquisition and internal growth of the mohawk segment product lines

selling  general and administrative expenses for were million of net sales compared to million of net sales for the increased percentage was attributable to the dal tile segment which has higher selling  general and administrative expenses but also has higher gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
the mohawk and dal tile including selling  general and administrative costs prior to the acquisition of dal tile segments selling  general and administrative expenses reflected improvements over  when compared to the improvements were due to better control of operating costs as net sales increased

the company s capital needs are met primarily through a combination of internally generated funds  bank credit lines  term and senior notes  the sale of receivables and credit terms from suppliers 
the level of accounts receivable increased from million at the beginning of to million at december  the million increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition of dal tile 
inventories increased from million at the beginning of to million at december   due primarily to the dal tile acquisition 
the outstanding checks in excess of cash represent trade payables checks that have not yet cleared the bank 
when the checks clear the bank  they are funded by the revolving credit facility 
this policy does not impact any liquid assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
excluding the acquisition of dal tile  capital expenditures totaled million during the capital expenditures made during were incurred primarily to modernize and expand manufacturing facilities and equipment 
the company s capital projects are primarily focused on increasing capacity  improving productivity and reducing costs 
capital expenditures  including million for acquisitions  have totaled million over the past three years 
the company s capital spending during  excluding acquisitions  is expected to range from million to million  and will be used primarily to purchase equipment to increase production capacity and productivity 
the company s revolving line of credit agreement provides for an interest rate of either i libor plus to  depending upon the company s performance measured against certain financial ratios  or ii the prime rate less and has a termination date of january  at december   the company had credit facilities of million under its revolving credit line and million under various short term uncommitted credit lines 
at december   a total of million was unused under these lines 
all of these lines are unsecured 
the credit agreement contains customary financial and other covenants 
the company must pay an annual facility fee ranging from 
to 
of the total credit commitment  depending upon the company s performance measured against specific coverage ratios  under the revolving credit line 
in connection with the dal tile acquisition  the company entered into a day term loan facility the bridge facility on march   to finance a portion of the acquisition 
on april   the company sold million of its senior notes due  series a and million of its senior notes due  series b through institutional private placements and used the proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness of approximately million under the bridge facility and approximately million under the company s revolving credit facility 
on june   the company exchanged approximately million of its registered notes due  series c for an equal amount of its series a senior notes and approximately million of its registered senior notes due  series d for an equal amount of its series b senior notes 
interest on each series is payable semiannually 
the company has two trade accounts receivable securitization agreements with bank agents for asset backed commercial paper conduits 
these facilities enable the company to borrow up to million through the mohawk segment and up to million through its dal tile segment 
each securitization is secured by the respective segment trade receivables and is subject to annual renewal 
at december   the company had no amounts outstanding under either securitization facility  both of which were available up to their respective facility limits 
at december   the mohawk segment had million outstanding secured by approximately million of receivables 
the company s debt structure also includes a combination of variable rate industrial revenue bonds and fixed rate term notes and senior notes with interest rates ranging from up to 
the industrial revenue bonds mature beginning in through and the term and senior notes mature through the industrial revenue bonds are backed by unsecured letters of credit 
the term and senior notes are also unsecured 
the aggregate principal amount of industrial revenue bonds  term and senior notes was million at december  on january   the company entered into a five year interest rate swap  which converted a notional amount of approximately million of its variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
under the agreement  payments are made based on a fixed rate of and received on a libor based variable rate 
differentials received or paid under the agreement will be recognized as interest expense 
during december  the company determined  based on future cash flow projections  that the cash flow hedge would more than likely become ineffective as strong cash flow has allowed the company to significantly reduce its outstanding libor based variable rate debt below the million hedged notional amount 
the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap previously included in other comprehensive income has been recorded as a realized loss in interest expense in the fourth quarter of the amount recorded in interest expense was million 
the company continues to carry the liability on the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and the interest rate swap will be marked to market in future reporting periods with any changes being recorded in interest expense

impact of inflation inflation affects the company s manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
the carpet and tile industry has experienced inflation in the prices of raw materials and fuel related costs 
in the past  the company has generally passed along these price increases to its customers and has been able to enhance productivity to offset increases in costs resulting from inflation in both the united states and mexico 
seasonality the company is a calendar year end company and its results of operations for the first quarter tend to be the weakest 
the second  third and fourth quarters typically produce higher net sales and operating income 
these results are primarily due to consumer residential spending patterns for floorcovering  which historically have decreased during the first two months of each year following the holiday season 
certain factors affecting the company s performance in addition to the other information provided in this form k  the following risk factors should be considered when evaluating an investment in shares of common stock 
if any of the events described in these risks were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to integrate mohawk and dal tile successfully by managing the challenges of that integration may result in the company not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the merger 
the company faces challenges in consolidating functions  integrating its organizations  procedures  operations and product lines in a timely and efficient manner and retaining key personnel 
these challenges will result principally because the two companies currently maintain executive offices in different locations  manufacture and sell different types of products through different distribution channels  conduct their businesses from various locations  and have different employment and compensation arrangements for their employees 
in addition  dal tile has a significant manufacturing operation in mexico  and the company has not previously operated a manufacturing facility outside of the united states 
as a result  the integration will be complex and will require additional attention from members of management 
the diversion of management attention and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues  level of expenses and operating results 
the floorcovering industry is cyclical and prolonged declines in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the us floorcovering industry is highly dependent on residential and commercial construction activity  including new construction as well as remodeling 
new construction activity and remodeling to a lesser degree are cyclical in nature and a prolonged decline in residential or commercial construction activity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction activity is significantly affected by numerous factors  all of which are beyond the company s control  including national and local economic conditions  interest rates  housing demand  employment levels  changes in disposable income  financing availability  commercial rental vacancy rates  business expenditures  federal and state income tax policies  and consumer confidence 
the us construction industry has experienced significant downturns in the past  which have adversely affected suppliers to the industry  including suppliers of floorcoverings 
the industry could experience similar downturns in the future  which could have a negative impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company faces intense competition in its industry  which could decrease demand for its products and could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
the industry is highly competitive 
the company faces competition from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers and independent distributors of floorcovering products 
some of its existing and potential competitors may be larger and have greater resources and access to capital than it does 
maintaining the company s competitive position may require it to make substantial investments in its product development efforts  manufacturing facilities  distribution network and sales and marketing activities 
competitive pressures may also result in decreased demand for its products and in the loss of market share 
in addition  the company faces  and will continue to face  pressure on sales prices of its products from competitors  as well as from large customers 
as a result of any of these factors  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s sales and profitability 
a failure to identify suitable acquisition candidates  to complete acquisitions and to integrate successfully the acquired operations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
as part of its business strategy  the company intends to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses 
although it regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities  it may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms to fund acquisitions  complete acquisitions  or profitably manage acquired businesses 
acquired operations may not achieve levels of sales  operating income or productivity comparable to those of its existing operations  or otherwise perform as expected 
acquisitions may also involve a number of special risks  some or all of which could have a material and adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  including  among others the company s inability to integrate operations  systems and procedures and to eliminate redundancies and excess costs effectively  diversion of management s attention and resources  and difficulty retaining and training acquired key personnel 
the company may be unable to obtain raw materials on a timely basis  which could have a material adverse effect on its business 
the company s business is dependent upon a continuous supply of raw materials from third party suppliers 
the principal raw materials used in its manufacturing operations include nylon fiber and polypropylene resin  which are used exclusively in its carpet and rug business  talc  clay  impure nepheline syenite  pure nepheline syenite and various glazes  including frit ground glass  zircon and stains  which are used exclusively in its ceramic tile business  and other materials 
the company has a single source supplier for all of its impure nepheline syenite and pure nepheline syenite requirements 
an extended interruption in the supply of these or other raw materials used in the company s business or in the supply of suitable substitute materials would disrupt the company s operations  which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company may be unable to pass on to its customers increases in the costs of raw materials and energy  which could have a material adverse effect on its profitability 
significant increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas used in the manufacture of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on its operating margins and its business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company purchases nylon fiber  polypropylene resin  talc  clay  impure nepheline syenite  pure nepheline syenite  frit  zircon  stains and other materials from third party suppliers 
the cost of some of these materials  like nylon and polypropylene resin  is related to oil prices 
the company also purchases significant amounts of natural gas to supply the energy required in some of its production processes 
the prices of these raw materials and of natural gas vary with market conditions 
although the company generally attempts to pass on increases in the costs of raw materials and natural gas to its customers  the company s ability to do so is  to a large extent  dependent upon the rate and magnitude of any increase  competitive pressures and market conditions for its products 
there have been in the past  and may be in the future  periods of time during which increases in these costs cannot be recovered 
during such periods of time  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s profitability 
the company has been  and in the future may be subject to claims and liabilities under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  which could be significant 
the company s operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing air emissions  wastewater discharges  and the use  storage  treatment and disposal of hazardous materials 
the applicable requirements under these laws are subject to amendment  to the imposition of new or additional requirements and to changing interpretations of agencies or courts 
new or additional requirements could be imposed  and the company could incur material expenditures to comply with new or existing regulations 
the nature of the company s operations and previous operations by others at real property currently or formerly owned or operated by the company and the disposal of waste at third party sites exposes the company to the risk of claims under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
the company could incur material costs or liabilities in connection with such claims 
the company has been  and will continue to be  subject to these claims 
the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions  changes in environmental  health  and safety laws and regulations  enforcement of existing or new requirements or other unanticipated events could give rise to expenditures and liabilities  including fines or penalties  that could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results or financial condition 
changes in international trade laws and in the business  political and regulatory environment in mexico could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s monterrey  mexico manufacturing facility represents a significant portion of the company s total manufacturing capacity for ceramic tile 
accordingly  an event that has a material adverse impact on the company s mexican operations could have a material adverse effect on the tile operations as a whole 
the business  regulatory and political environments in mexico differ from those in the united states  and the company s mexican operations are exposed to a number of inherent risks  including changes in international trade laws  such as the north american free trade agreement  or nafta  affecting the company s import and export activities in mexico  changes in mexican labor laws and regulations affecting the company s ability to hire and retain employees in mexico  currency exchange restrictions and fluctuations in the value of foreign currency  potentially adverse tax consequences  local laws concerning repatriation of profits  political conditions in mexico  unexpected changes in the regulatory environment in mexico  and changes in general economic conditions in mexico 
the company could face increased competition as a result of the general agreement on tariffs and trade and the north american free trade agreement 
the united states is party to the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt 
under gatt  the united states currently imposes import duties on ceramic tile imported from countries outside north america at no more than  to be reduced ratably to no less than by accordingly  as these duties decrease  gatt may stimulate competition from manufacturers in these countries  which now export  or may seek to export  ceramic tile to the united states 
the company is uncertain what effect gatt may have on its operations 
the north american free trade agreement nafta was entered into by canada  mexico and the united states and over a transition period will remove most customs duties imposed on goods traded among the three countries 
in addition  nafta will remove or limit many investment restrictions  liberalize trade in services  provide a specialized means for settlement of  and remedies for  trade disputes arising under applicable laws and will result in new laws and regulations to further these goals 
although nafta lowers the tariffs imposed on the company s ceramic tile manufactured in mexico and sold in the united states  it may also stimulate competition in the united states and canada from manufacturers located in mexico  which could negatively affect the company s business 
forward looking information certain of the matters discussed in the preceding pages  particularly regarding anticipation of future financial performance  business prospects  growth and operating strategies  proposed acquisitions  new products and similar matters  and those preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates or similar expressions constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended 
for those statements  mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of those statements are based on assumptions regarding the company s ability to maintain its sales growth and gross margins and to control costs 
these or other assumptions could prove inaccurate and therefore  there can be no assurance that the forward looking statements will prove to be accurate 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors  in addition to those discussed elsewhere in this document  affect the future results of mohawk and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements materially adverse changes in economic conditions generally in the carpet  rug  ceramic tile and other floorcovering markets served by mohawk  the successful integration of dal tile into mohawk s business  competition from other carpet  rug  ceramic tile and floorcovering manufacturers  raw material prices  declines in residential or commercial construction activity  timing and level of capital expenditures  the successful integration of acquisitions  including the challenges inherent in diverting mohawk management s attention and resources from other strategic matters and from operational matters for an extended period of time  the successful introduction of new products  the successful rationalization of existing operations  and other risks identified from time to time in the company s sec reports and public announcements 
any forward looking statements represent mohawk s estimates only as of the date of this report and should not be relied upon as representing mohawk s estimates as of any subsequent date

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial exposures are managed as an integral part of the company s risk management program  which seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect that the volatility of the interest rate  exchange rate and natural gas markets may have on its operating results 
the company does not regularly engage in speculative transactions  nor does it regularly hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk management the company used an interest rate swap contract to adjust the proportion of total debt that was subject to variable interest rates as compared to fixed interest rates 
under the interest rate swap contract  the company agreed to pay an amount equal to a fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount of million  and to receive in return an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional principal amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged  and no other cash payments are made 
the contract fair value is reflected on the consolidated balance sheets and related gains or losses were deferred in other comprehensive income 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income as an adjustment to interest expense over the same period in which the related interest payments being hedged are recognized in income 
however  to the extent that any of these contracts are not considered to be effective in offsetting the change in the value of the interest payments being hedged  any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts is immediately recognized in earnings 
during december  the company determined  based on future cash flow projections  that the cash flow hedge would more than likely become ineffective as strong cash flow has allowed the company to significantly reduce its outstanding libor based variable rate debt below the million hedged notional amount 
the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap previously included in other comprehensive income has been recorded as a realized loss in interest expense in the fourth quarter of the amount recorded in interest expense was million 
the company continues to carry the liability on its consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and the interest rate swap will be marked to market in future reporting periods with any changes being recorded in interest expense 
the floating interest rate at which the hedge was deemed ineffective was 
a basis point change in interest rates would reduce increase interest expense by approximately million 
natural gas risk management the company uses a combination of natural gas futures contracts and long term supply agreements to manage unanticipated changes in natural gas prices 
the contracts are based on forecasted usage of natural gas measured in million british thermal units mmbtu 
the company has designated the natural gas futures contracts as cash flow hedges 
the outstanding contracts are valued at market with the offset going to other comprehensive income  net of applicable income taxes and any hedge ineffectiveness 
any gain or loss is recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
at december   the company had natural gas contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of approximately million mmbtu s 
the fair value of these contracts  which mature from january to december  was an asset of million  with the offset recorded in other comprehensive income  net of applicable income taxes 
the long term supply agreements are accounted for under the normal purchases provision within sfas no 
and its amendments 
at december   the company has normal purchase commitments of approximately million mmbtu s for periods maturing from january through august the contracted value of these commitments was approximately million and the fair value of these commitments was approximately million  at december  foreign currency rate management the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge costs associated with its operations in mexico 
the objective of these transactions is to reduce volatility of exchange rates where these operations are located by fixing a portion of their costs in us currency 
gains and losses are recognized in cost of goods sold in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
accordingly  these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   the company had forward contracts maturing from january through december  to purchase approximately million mexican pesos 
the aggregate us dollar value of these contracts at december  was approximately million 
the contracts are marked to market in other current liabilities with the offset to other comprehensive income  net of applicable income taxes 
unrealized losses at december   were not material
