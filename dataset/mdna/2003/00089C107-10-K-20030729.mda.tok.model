item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the description of business  financial statements and the related notes of ade which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect ade s plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below and in the forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
overview ade was incorporated in to develop and market certain advanced concepts and designs in capacitance and other measurement technologies suitable for industrial applications requiring precise  reliable  damage free and repeatable measurements 
our products have evolved from single instruments used in off line engineering analysis to multi function systems for automated in line monitoring of process induced defects throughout the semiconductor wafer  device and data storage manufacturing processes 
we operate three major business segments  the semiconductor systems group ssg  ade phase shift pst and ade technologies ati 
the semiconductor systems group manufactures multifunctional semiconductor metrology and automation systems and optical wafer defect inspection equipment used to detect particles and other defects on silicon wafer surfaces 
ade phase shift manufactures high performance  non contact surface metrology equipment using advanced interferometric technology that provides enhanced yield management to the data storage  semiconductor and optics industries 
ade technologies manufactures high precision magnetic characterization and non contact dimensional metrology gaging systems primarily for the magnetic data storage and semiconductor manufacturing industries 
the company s markets are cyclical 
beginning in fiscal year  the company experienced decreased demand for its products in all business segments as a result of the downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the data storage industry 
consequently  the company experienced reduced order levels and revenues during fiscal year in response to the industry downturn  the company underwent cost reduction measures  including headcount reductions  while maintaining its investment in research and development to position the company for the next wave of capital spending in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing industries as well as the data storage industry 
during fiscal year  the company experienced slight increases in quarterly orders  revenue and backlog and achieved profitability during the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
these improved results were due in part to increased order activity from asia during fiscal year as well as the aforementioned cost reduction measures 
however  the company makes no assurances that the order  revenue  backlog and profit levels can be sustained in future periods 
restructuring during the first quarter of fiscal  the company implemented selective headcount reductions and closed three satellite offices in response to the prolonged downturn in the semiconductor and magnetic data storage industries 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted of  in employee severance expenses for the terminated employees spread across all functional areas of the company and  related to the closing of the satellite offices  which primarily represents future lease obligations on the vacated offices 
when applicable  anticipated future sublease income relating to vacated offices was offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments 
the sublease income was based on estimates and will be monitored going forward and is subject to change 
all severance payments from the first quarter restructuring have been made by april  during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of the continued downturn in the semiconductor wafer and device manufacturing and magnetic data storage industries  the company recorded a restructuring charge of  which consisted primarily of severance expenses for the terminated employees across all segments and various functional areas of the company 
the majority of all severance payments from the second quarter restructuring have been made by april  on august   an agreement was entered into between the company and its former chief executive officer  robert c 
abbe 
under the terms of the agreement  ade agreed to pay a total of million over a three year period  beginning in september  for severance and consulting services 
the company recorded a restructuring charge of  for the severance portion of mr 
abbe s agreement  which will be paid through september this amount is included in the  discussed above 
the consulting portion of the agreement will be expensed as incurred 
below is a table summarizing the activity related to the restructuring accrual for the fiscal year ended april  severance office closures total in thousands restructuring accrual cash payments balance at july  restructuring accrual cash payments balance at october  cash payments balance at january  cash payments balance at april  critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of and for the periods reflected in the company s financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  and warranty obligations 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  accounting for income taxes and valuation of goodwill and software to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company changed its revenue recognition policy effective may   as required by and based on guidance provided in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s standard customer arrangement includes a signed purchase order  in which it offers payment terms of to days  no right of return of delivered products and a twelve month warranty 
the company assesses whether the fee associated with its revenue transactions is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after the company s normal payment terms  to days  it determines that the fee is not fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs on going credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of the company s international customers  it requires that an irrevocable letter of credit be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  it defers the fee and recognizes the revenue at the time that collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
for some of the company s sales transactions  a portion  usually  of the fee is not due until installation occurs and the customer accepts the product 
the other of the fee is normally due to days after shipment 
if the company has met defined customer acceptance experience levels with a specific type of product  these transactions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements with the deferral of the portion of the fee not due until installation is complete and customer acceptance has occurred 
management of the company must make a determination of what constitutes an appropriate experience level with a product 
this determination is based on  but not limited to  the extent to which a product contains significantly new technology  the number of similarly configured products previously delivered and the company s experience with a particular customer 
the portion of the fee related to the installation of the product and customer training is classified as service revenue 
all other sales with customer acceptance provisions are recognized as revenue upon customer acceptance 
the company s transactions frequently involve the sales of systems and services under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is allocated to all elements except systems based upon the fair value of those elements 
the amounts allocated to training are based upon the price charged when this element is sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation revenue is based upon hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
the amount allocated to systems is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to system revenue 
installation and training are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
the company accrues for anticipated warranty costs upon shipment 
revenue from the sale of parts is recognized upon shipment 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed provided collection of the related receivable is probable 
service contract revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual periods in which the services are provided 
revenue from software licenses is recognized when an agreement has been executed  software has been delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns and specific collection issues 
where specific collection issues are identified  the company records a specific allowance based on the amount that the company believes will be collected 
for accounts where specific collection issues are not identified  the company will record a reserve based on the age of the receivable and historical collection patterns 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
the company s policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts 
inventory that  in the judgment of management  is obsolete or in excess of the company s estimated usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for the company s products  and technological obsolescence 
significant management judgments must be made when establishing the reserve for obsolete and excess inventory 
if the company s judgments and estimates relating to obsolete and excess inventory prove to be inadequate  its financial results could be materially adversely affected in future periods 
if the inventory value is written down to its net realizable value  and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold 
accounting for income taxes the company records income taxes using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the company s financial statements contain certain deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  its deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against its net deferred tax assets 
the company evaluates the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
as of april   the company has a valuation allowance for the full amount of its deferred tax assets 
the decision to record the valuation allowance required significant judgment 
had the company not recorded this allowance  it would have reported materially different results 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is based on significant estimates  and it is at least reasonably possible that changes in these estimates in the near term could materially affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of goodwill and software intangible assets consist of million of goodwill obtained through the acquisition of the semiconductor solutions division of lpa software  inc ssd in september as well as million of capitalized license fees for software included in the company s products 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which was effective for the company on may  sfas requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization and includes provisions for the reclassification of certain existing recognized intangibles as goodwill  reassessment of the useful lives of existing recognized intangibles  and reclassification of certain intangibles out of previously reported goodwill 
in accordance with this statement  the company discontinued the amortization of its net goodwill of million on may  in addition  the company was required to perform a transitional impairment test for goodwill under sfas the impairment test under sfas uses a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is greater than fair value  the unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step must be completed to measure the amount of the goodwill impairment charge  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is compared with the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount is greater than the implied fair value  the carrying value of the goodwill must be written down to its implied fair value 
the company completed the transitional impairment test of its goodwill as of may  and no adjustment to goodwill was necessary 
the company is required to perform impairment tests under sfas annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the goodwill may be impaired 
factors the company considers important that could trigger the impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  significant decline in the company s technological value as compared to the market  the company s market capitalization relative to net book value  and unanticipated competition 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company s market capitalization value fell below its book value for a brief period of time 
if the company s market value falls below its book value for an extended period of time in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment of its goodwill and such amount could be material to the company s results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended april   the company performed its annual impairment test in accordance with sfas and determined that the carrying value of its goodwill was not impaired 
net capitalized license fees of million for software included in the company s products  which are still being amortized  are amortized at the greater of the ratio that current gross revenue for the related products bears to the total current and anticipated future gross revenue for those products or on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
at each quarter end  the carrying value of the software is compared to net realizable value nrv 
nrv is the estimated future gross revenues from products that incorporate the software reduced by the estimated future costs of disposal 
if nrv is less than the carrying value  the excess is written off and nrv becomes the new carrying value of the software 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made when establishing criteria for future cash flows  estimating reporting unit fair value and assessing impairment 
if the company s judgments and estimates relating to goodwill and software prove to be inadequate  an asset may be determined to be impaired and the company s financial results could be materially adversely impacted 
likewise  if a future event or circumstance indicates that an impairment assessment is required and  through the performance of that assessment  an asset is determined to be impaired  the company s financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has not created  and is not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated into its financial statements 
the company does not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into its financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect its liquidity or the availability of capital resources  except as set forth below under liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations the following table presents the percentage of total revenue for the respective line items in ade s consolidated statements of operations 
year ended april  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from operations interest and other income expense  net net income loss fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  systems and parts revenue 
systems and parts revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue in the ssg segment decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal decreased sales of the company s products in the ssg segment reflected a decrease in demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor wafer and device industries as a result of the current severe down cycle 
revenue in the pst segment increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in revenue from the pst segment was due primarily to industry acceptance and demand for its semiconductor industry products 
wafer manufacturers capital equipment purchases have been focused on advanced industry requirements rather than on capacity expansion  which has resulted in technology purchases of the company s next generation of products 
however  wafer manufacturers have been slowly adding capacity and the company has experienced an increase in shipments of legacy products as a result of these capacity related purchases 
the company sells its semiconductor products to both wafer and device manufacturers 
historically  the company s semiconductor revenue has been derived more from wafer manufacturers than device manufacturers 
an increase in short term chip demand or increases in semiconductor market capital expenditures is expected to impact device manufacturers prior to wafer manufacturers as wafer manufacturers are further down on the overall semiconductor industry supply chain 
for the first quarter of fiscal  the company expects revenue from the semiconductor industry to decline due to the lighter bookings activity experienced early in fiscal the data storage industry has experienced extreme pricing pressure  consolidation and excess supply in many data storage market segments  which has resulted in reduced production and capital equipment purchases 
consequently  revenue from the products that are marketed to the data storage industry by the company s ati segment decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in revenue is due primarily to decreased shipments of the company s magnetic storage products during fiscal a breakdown of the company s total revenues by industry is as follows year ended april  wafer device oem magnetic data storage total service revenue 
service revenue was million in both fiscal and fiscal the company s service revenue consists of fees for installation  training  product maintenance and technical support services 
the majority of the company s service revenue is derived from the ssg segment 
gross profit systems and parts 
gross profit increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to increased gross profit in the ssg segment as a result of factory overhead cost reductions undertaken over the past fiscal year 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was an increase in the gross profit of the pst segment due to increased volume and product mix as described in the discussion of system and parts revenue 
gross profit service 
gross profit improved to in fiscal from in fiscal the improved gross profit was due to overhead cost reductions undertaken over the past fiscal year 
research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the decrease in expense resulted primarily from a decrease in payroll  consulting and project material expenses in all segments  which were part of the overall cost reduction measures taken by the company over the past fiscal year 
the company continues to invest in its semiconductor wafer and device industry products as well as new products for the magnetic storage industry  including those that measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 
the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenues reflects the cost reduction measures mentioned above 
the company expects research and development expense over the short term to be at or near current levels as a percentage of revenues in order to capitalize on the next wave of worldwide capital spending  which is expected to be focused on mm wafer production 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue at in both fiscal and fiscal the decreased expense resulted from a decrease in commissions expense on sales made through internal and external sales representatives due to the decrease in sales during fiscal also contributing to the decrease in expense was decreased payroll expense and discretionary spending including travel and advertising in all segments of the company 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal expense decreased primarily due to decreased payroll and benefits related expenses as a result of cost cutting measures taken over the past year 
this decrease in payroll related expenses was slightly offset by an increase in legal and patent expense of million primarily as a result of the ongoing litigation with kla tencor 
also included in fiscal expenses was an impairment charge of million related to the company s newton  massachusetts property  which has been classified as held for sale in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the impairment charge was based on the company s best estimate of the current value of the property less selling costs 
it is possible that the company could record further impairment on this property if market conditions in the real estate market were to deteriorate 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest and other income was due primarily to a decrease in invested cash balances as well as a decrease in interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million in both fiscal and fiscal the company s interest expense is primarily associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and ssg manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts  the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ati in newton  massachusetts and the construction of the pst headquarters and manufacturing facility in tucson  arizona 
the interest rates on these bonds are fixed 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal consists of state and foreign income taxes 
the decrease in income taxes in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to an increase of million in the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets during fiscal the company has deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
during the second quarter of fiscal  as a result of that year s operating losses to date  anticipated additional operating losses for the third quarter of  an expected operating loss for fiscal year  and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  the company recorded an additional valuation allowance to reserve the remaining deferred tax assets  resulting in income tax expense of million 
the company currently has a valuation allowance for the full amount of its net deferred taxes 
as of april   the company has available unused operating loss carryforwards  which may be applied against future taxable income 
net operating loss carryforwards generated in fiscal and begin to expire in fiscal for state purposes and for federal purposes 
the fiscal provision for income taxes was partially offset by a  refund due to certain tax law changes 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal decreased sales of the company s products in the ssg segment reflected a decrease in demand for capital equipment in the semiconductor wafer and device industries as a result of the current severe down cycle 
revenue in the pst segment also decreased in fiscal compared with fiscal as a result of the current down cycle 
wafer and device manufacturers capital equipment purchases were focused on advanced industry requirements rather than on capacity expansion  which resulted in technology purchases of the company s next generation of products in both the ssg and the pst segments 
the data storage industry continued to experience extreme pricing pressure  consolidation and excess supply in many data storage market segments  which resulted in reduced production and capital equipment purchases 
consequently  revenues from the products that are marketed to the data storage industry by the company s ati segment decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated revenue in fiscal was million higher than aggregate segment revenue for this period and reflects the impact of revenue from sales to japan ade  ltd 
that were recognized in fiscal for consolidated reporting purposes but were recognized during fiscal on a segment basis 
the decrease in service revenues was consistent with the decrease in system and parts revenue and was reflective of the current down cycle in the wafer and device manufacturing industries 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit was due primarily to the higher percentage of shipments of mm products in the ssg segment  which carry lower margins in their initial stages than the company s legacy products 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit was a decline in factory utilization in all segments in fiscal compared to fiscal due to the decrease in demand for the company s products 
gross profit from sales of services increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of overhead expense reductions during fiscal research and development 
research and development expense in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to from 
the sustained level of expense resulted primarily from continued investment by the ssg segment to develop its afs and awis products to capitalize on the next wave of worldwide capital spending  which is expected to be focused on mm wafer production 
also contributing to the overall level of expense was continued investment in research and development by the pst segment 
the company also continued to develop new products for the data storage industry  including those that measure the magnetic properties of materials used in manufacturing disk drives 
the increase in expense as a percentage of revenues resulted primarily from the decrease in revenues during fiscal compared to fiscal marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  and remained consistent as a percentage of revenue at in both fiscal and fiscal the decreased expense in the all business segments resulted primarily from decreased commissions expense on sales made through both internal and external sales representatives 
the mix of sales channels through which the company s products are sold may have a significant impact on the company s marketing and sales expense and the results in any period may not be indicative of marketing and sales expense for future periods 
also contributing to the decrease in expense was a decrease in payroll expense and discretionary spending such as travel and advertising 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of revenue to in fiscal from in fiscal expenses increased primarily due to an increase in legal and patent expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in legal and patent expenses was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense and lower discretionary spending during fiscal compared with fiscal interest and other income 
interest and other income  net of interest expense  was million in fiscal versus million in fiscal fiscal interest and other income of million was mostly offset by interest expense of million associated with the industrial development bonds used to finance the acquisition and renovation of our corporate headquarters and ssg manufacturing facility in westwood  massachusetts  the headquarters and manufacturing facility of ati in newton  massachusetts and the construction of the pst headquarters and manufacturing facility in tucson  arizona 
the interest rates on these bonds are fixed 
the decrease in interest and other income was due to both a decrease in interest rates and a decrease in invested cash balances in fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the provision for income taxes in fiscal consisted of an increase of million in the valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets that was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal the company has deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of operating losses incurred in prior years  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting

selected consolidated quarterly operating results the following table presents consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period beginning may  and ending april  this information has been derived from ade s unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and include all normal recurring adjustments considered necessary to present fairly this information when read in conjunction with ade s annual audited financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
our quarterly operating results have varied and may continue to vary significantly 
our quarterly revenue typically is derived from a relatively small number of customer orders 
these customer orders may consist of multiple systems  each of which is priced between approximately  and  as a result  the timing of significant orders or a reduction in the number of systems shipped in a quarter could have a material effect on our revenue and results of operations for that quarter 
the results for a particular quarter may also vary due to a number of other factors  including economic conditions in the semiconductor and magnetic data storage industries product mix of our sales for the period the sales distribution channel of our sales for the period competitive pricing pressures our ability to design  introduce and manufacture new products on a cost effective and timely basis customer cancellations or rescheduled shipments production difficulties or the inability to obtain critical components resulting in delayed shipments seasonal factors such as customers capital budget approval cycles 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
significant levels of our expenses are fixed in advance and based in part on our expectations as to future revenue 
as a consequence  any material shortfall in revenue in a given quarter could have a material adverse effect on our earnings

liquidity and capital resources at april   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in working capital 
in addition  the company had million in restricted cash used as security for a tax exempt industrial development bond issued through the massachusetts industrial finance agency in december under the terms of the agreement  the company may substitute a letter of credit in an amount equal to approximately of the outstanding principal balance as collateral for its obligations under this bond  assuming it has the ability to borrow under a credit facility 
such actions would allow the restricted cash balance to be used for general corporate purposes 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended april  was million 
this amount resulted from a net loss of million  adjusted for net non cash charges of million and a million net increase in working capital accounts 
non cash items primarily consisted of million of depreciation and amortization and million for a long lived asset impairment charge related to the company putting its newton  massachusetts facility up for sale 
the net increase in working capital of million was comprised of an increase in accounts receivable  and deferred income from affiliate of million and million  respectively  as well as decreases in inventories of million  prepaid expenses of million  accounts payable of million  and accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted from the increased billings during the second half of fiscal the increase in deferred income on sales to japan ade  ltd 
jal is due to the timing of shipments to jal and the acceptance of those shipments by jal s customers 
the decrease in inventory resulted primarily from shipments of backlog from the end of the last fiscal year and from decreased inventory purchases related to the decrease in customer orders at the end of fiscal and early in fiscal the decrease in prepaid expenses results primarily from the timing of payments 
the decrease in accounts payable resulted primarily from decreased purchases of inventory and the timing of payments to vendors 
the decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulted from decreases in deferred revenue  accrued payroll and accrued warranty  which is related to decreased sales levels 
cash provided by investing activities was million  and consisted of million for net sales of fixed assets  specifically demo systems  and a decrease in restricted cash of million 
cash used in financing activities was million and consisted of million in principal payments of long term debt  which was offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of stock under the company s employee stock purchase plan 
under generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states  certain obligations and commitments are not required to be included in the consolidated balance sheet 
these obligations and commitments  while entered into in the normal course of business  may have a material impact on liquidity 
the company does not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  the company is not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if the company had engaged in such relationships
