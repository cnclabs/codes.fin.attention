merchant processing industry matters on june   mastercard and visa announced that they have settled the class action antitrust lawsuit which was filed by wal mart stores  inc sears  roebuck and co 
and other merchants against mastercard and visa 
this lawsuit began in when a group of merchants sued mastercard and visa over their signature debit interchange rates and policies on merchant card acceptance  which is commonly known in the industry as the honor all cards rule 
the settlement included damages to be paid to certain merchants  lower signature debit interchange rates and modification of card acceptance policies  so that merchants are no longer required to accept visa and mastercard signature based  offline debit cards as a condition for accepting visa and mastercard credit cards 
due to the policy changes on cards merchants can choose to accept and consumers preference for higher security  we believe that this settlement may result in an increase in personal identification number  or pin based debit usage 
although it is difficult to determine the impact of this settlement on global payments  we do not expect this to have a significant negative impact on our future growth 
business description global payments inc  or global payments  is a high volume processor of electronic transactions and related money transfers that principally enables consumers  corporations  government agencies and other profit and non profit business enterprises to purchase goods and services or further other economic goals

index to financial statements many merchant customers to access the card associations and debit networks at a significantly lower cost 
our check products offer merchant customers risk management  in the case of verification and recovery  or risk elimination  in the case of guarantee  by leveraging our vast database of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter 
credit and debit card transaction processing credit and debit card transaction processing includes business to business purchasing card  private label  gift and loyalty card and electronic benefits transfer program processing 
credit and debit card processing describes a consumer acquiring goods or services from a retail location  whereas business to business card processing refers to a corporate purchasing department acquiring goods  such as office supplies or raw materials  from a corporate vendor 
although card transactions may appear simplistic  a transaction requires a complex process involving various participants in a series of electronic connections 
aside from electronic transaction processors  also known as merchant acquirers  such as global payments  participants in this process include card issuers  merchants  cardholders  and card associations 
card issuers are financial institutions that issue credit cards to approved applicants and are identifiable by their trade name typically imprinted on the issued cards 
the term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services  such as retail stores  restaurants  corporate purchasing departments  universities  and government agencies 
an approved applicant for a credit card from a card issuer is referred to as a cardholder  and may be any entity for which an issuer wishes to extend a line of credit  such as a consumer  corporation  or government agency 
the cardholder may use the card at any merchant location that meets the qualification standards of the card associations  known as mastercard and visa  or other card issuers such as american express  discover  diners club and debit networks such as star  nyce  and pulse in the united states and interac in canada 
debit cards payments differ slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction  or the debit card transaction will not be authorized 
pin based or online debit transactions are sent through a debit network  while signature based  offline debit  or check card transactions are sent through card associations and require a signature at the time of purchase 
also  pin based or online debit transactions deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder s deposit account within a day of the purchase  depending on the time of the purchase 
signature based  offline debit  or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder s deposit account two to three days after the purchase  although the funds are held with a memo posted to the cardholder s bank account 
a credit card posts to a cardholders account  reducing the available credit limit in a similar manner 
the card associations and debit networks consist of members  generally financial institutions  who establish uniform regulations that govern much of the industry 
during a typical card transaction  the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other  but instead rely on electronic transaction processor intermediaries  such as global payments  and card associations to exchange the required information and funds 
credit card and debit card transactions account for approximately and  respectively  in the united states  and and  respectively  in canada  of our total transactions processed 
we perform a series of services including authorization  electronic draft capture  funds settlement and certain exception based  back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 
the following is a more detailed description of credit and debit card transactions a card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location and the merchant swipes the card s magnetic strip through a point of sale  or pos  terminal card reader  which may be provided by global payments through our terminal management offering 
for a credit card transaction  authorization services generally refer to the process whereby the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed a defined limit 
the terminal electronically records sales draft information  such as the credit card identification number  transaction date  and dollar value of the goods or services purchased 
in a pin based debit transaction  the terminal records the card number  pin and dollar value of the purchase 

table of contents 
index to financial statements after a card is swiped  the terminal automatically dials a pre programmed phone number connected to our network in order to receive authorization of the transaction 
we route the request to the applicable card association or debit network 
the card association or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer  who determines a response based on the status of the cardholder s account 
the response is returned to the merchant s terminal via the same communication network 
this entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds from the time the merchant swipes the cardholder s card through the point of sale terminal card reader 
electronic draft capture is the process of transferring sales draft data into electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement 
the card associations use either a system known as interchange  in the case of credit cards  or the debit networks in the case of debit cards  to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and us to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
funds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and credits between cardholders and card issuers  including the final debiting of a cardholder s account and crediting of a merchant s account for a sales transaction 
depending on the type of transaction  either the interchange system or the debit networks are used to transfer the information and funds between electronic transaction processors and card issuers  and complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
we use our network telecommunication infrastructure and the federal reserve s automated clearing house system  or ach in the united states and the automated clearing settlement system  and the large value transfer system  both in canada  to ensure that our merchants receive the proper funds due to them for the value of the goods or services that the cardholder purchased 
in the united states  merchant funding primarily occurs after we receive the funds from the card issuer 
this business model differs from the business model followed in canada  where we advance payment to merchants for credit and debit card transactions before receiving the interchange or debit transaction reimbursement from the card issuers 
each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for their services 
as an illustration  on a credit card or offline debit transaction  the card issuer may fund us retaining approximately referred to as an interchange fee 
we would  in turn  pay the merchant and pay assessment fees to the card association of approximately 
after the end of the month  we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction  or discount  to cover the full amount of the interchange fee  assessment fee and our net revenue from the transaction 
if our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was basis points  we would bill the merchant at the end of the month for the transaction  reimburse ourselves for approximately in interchange and assessment fees and retain as our net revenue for the transaction 
for a pin based debit card transaction  a rate per transaction is charged which includes our fee and debit network fees 
the card issuer seeks reimbursement of from the cardholder in the form of a monthly credit card bill or charging the cardholders bank account in the case of a debit card transaction 
in addition to the card processing services described above  we also process retrieval requests on behalf of merchants for issuing banks and portfolios and provide chargeback resolution services  both of which relate to cardholders disputing an amount that has been charged to their credit card 
we review the dispute and handle the related exchange of information and funds between the merchant and the card issuer if a charge is to be reversed 
our merchant accounting services provide information primarily for our financial institution customers to monitor portfolio performance  control expenses  disseminate information  and track profitability through the production and distribution of detailed statements summarizing electronic transaction processing activity 
our risk management services allow financial institutions and independent sales organizations  or isos  to monitor credit risk  thereby enhancing the profitability of their merchant portfolios 
our risk management services include credit underwriting  credit scoring  fraud control  account processing  and collections 
we also provide our customers with various support services  such as working with merchants to set up their credit card programs or resolving issues relating to their terminal card readers 
check guarantee services check guarantee services include comprehensive check verification and guarantee services designed for a merchant s specific needs and risk adversity 
since this service offering guarantees payment of all checks that are 
table of contents 
index to financial statements electronically verified primarily using point of sale check readers through our extensive database  merchants may safely expand their revenue base by applying less stringent requirements when accepting checks from consumers 
if a verified check is dishonored  our check guarantee service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check s face value  and then pursues collection of the check through our internal collection services 
to protect against this risk  we use verification databases that contain information on historical delinquent check writing activity and up to date consumer bank account status 
we derive revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check 
in the specialized vertical market of gaming  our vip preferred proprietary software provides the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for the casinos customers 
because vip preferred cardholders have fast access to cash with high limits  gaming establishments can increase money to their floor and eliminate associated risk because transactions are percent guaranteed 
we also offer an electronic check option  vip preferred e check  which eliminates the need for paper checks as part of the vip preferred suite of products 
check verification and recovery services check verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service  except that this service does not guarantee payment of the verified checks 
this service provides a low cost  loss reduction solution for merchants wishing to quickly measure a customer s check worthiness at the point of sale  while not having to incur the additional expense of check guarantee services 
we derive revenue for these services primarily from the service fees collected from delinquent check writers  fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check  and fees charged to merchants for specialized services  such as electronic re deposits of dishonored checks 
our terminal management offering provides a variety of products and services relating to electronic transaction processing equipment  such as terminal programming and deployment  set up and telephone training  maintenance and equipment replacement  warehousing and inventory control  customer service and technical support  customized reporting  and conversions 
we provide these services directly to our own portfolio of merchants to support our credit and debit card transaction processing  check guarantee and check verification and recovery services  as well as  indirectly to merchants on behalf of our financial institution and independent sales organization customers 
we derive revenue from equipment sales and rentals  programming and deployment fees  and repairs and maintenance services 
funds transfer our electronic funds transfer product and service offerings include a wide variety of services such as financial electronic data interchange  or edi  account balance reporting  management information and deposit reporting 
these products and services provide financial  management and operational data to financial institutions  corporations and government agencies worldwide and allow these organizations to exchange the information with financial institutions and other service providers 
we also provide edi tax filing and internet tax payment services that allow financial institutions and government agencies to offer corporate taxpayers a secure and convenient method of paying taxes electronically 
tax payment security is handled through both ssl encryption decryption and multi level password access and operates through a web site that serves as the portal for securely receiving tax information and delivering the transaction for payment 
sales and marketing we offer end to end services  which means that we believe we have the ability to fulfill all of our customers needs with respect to merchant services and funds transfer offerings 
we market our services through a variety of sales channels that includes a large  dedicated sales force  independent sales organizations  independent sales representatives  an internal telesales group  trade associations  alliance and agent bank relationships  and financial institutions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to receiving referrals from approximately  bank branch locations in canada  we have affiliations with more than organizations  including financial institutions and trade associations  and approximately certified application providers  or caps  in the united states that provide sales leads 
additionally  we market directly to customers through print advertising and direct mail efforts 
we also participate in major industry tradeshow and publicity events and actively employ various public relations campaigns 
we pursue this strategy in an attempt to utilize the lowest delivery cost system available to successfully acquire target customers 
we market our products and services throughout the united states  canada and europe 
for a discussion of revenues in the united states  canada and europe for the fiscal years ended may   and  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have two basic business models we use to market our products and services 
in one model  which we refer to as direct merchant services  we have a salaried and commissioned sales force and isos which sell our end to end services directly to merchants 
in the other model  which we refer to as indirect merchant services  we provide unbundled products and services primarily to financial institutions that in turn resell our products and their services to their merchants 
for the fiscal year ended may   approximately of our revenue arose from direct merchant services and arose from indirect merchant services  while the remaining arose from our funds transfer service offering 
direct revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value  whereas indirect and funds transfer revenue is generated on merchants charged a specified amount per transaction 
we also charge for other processing fees  unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value 
employees as of june   we and our subsidiaries had approximately  employees 
many of our employees are highly skilled in technical areas specific to electronic transaction processing  and we believe that our current and future operations depend substantially on retaining these employees 
competition our primary competitors in the electronic transaction processing industry include other independent processors  as well as major national and regional financial institution processors and isos 
certain of these companies are privately held  and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to precisely quantify our relative competitive position 
as an independent processor  our principal affiliation with financial institutions relates to the sponsorship that enables our access to the card associations and debit networks 
we believe an independent processor will tend to be a merchant customer advocate  as there is no other relationship with a card issuing business or cardholder customer service  as a financial institution 
also  a financial institution processor sales channel is primarily based on referrals with in the institution  to further leverage a customer relationship  an independent processor or iso will tend to be focused on sales from all channels  including internally generated leads 
finally  a financial institution processor may not have the same executive focus on a merchant services business  as the business is not core to the total revenues of the financial institution 
we primarily differ from isos in that we have our own platform and financial institution sponsorship agreements 
based on industry publications such the nilson report  dated march  we are a leading  mid market merchant acquirer in the united states 
according to that report  one of our competitors  first data corporation and its affiliates  is the largest electronic transaction processor in the united states 
in april  first data corporation announced a definitive agreement to merge with concord efs  inc the merger is currently under review by antitrust authorities and if approved  the combined companies  excluding visa and mastercard  would result in the largest market share of electronic transaction processing and network ownership in the united states 
although the consummation of this merger would increase the size of the largest competitor in the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements merchant processing industry  this merger may present us and other merchant processors with additional opportunities 
this merger should not directly impact us as we focus on the mid market merchant segment in the united states and we do not own a debit network  whereas these competitors focus on larger market merchants and own debit networks 
our primary competitor in canada is moneris solutions  which we believe has a slightly larger share of the canadian electronic transaction market than we do 
moneris solutions is a joint investment of the royal bank of canada and the bank of montreal 
however  we believe that we are the largest  publicly traded independent processor in canada 
the most significant competitive factors related to our product and services include customer service  quality  value added features  functionality  price  reliability  the breadth and effectiveness of our distribution channel  and the manner in which we deliver our services 
while we service all industry segments  we specialize in the mid market segment in the united states and the large market segment in canada 
we define mid market as a merchant with an average of thousand to thousand in annual visa and or mastercard volume 
these competitive factors will continue to change as new distribution channels and alternative payment solutions are developed by our competitors and us 
our primary strategy to distinguish ourselves from our competitors focuses on offering a variety of electronic transaction processing payment solutions to our customers 
these enhanced services involve vertical market and sophisticated reporting features that add value to the information obtained from our electronic transaction processing databases 
we believe that our knowledge of these specific markets  the size and effectiveness of our dedicated sales force  affiliations with trade associations  agent banks and caps  our ability to offer specific  integrated solutions to our customers  including hardware  software  processing  and network facilities  and our flexibility in packaging these products are positive factors that enhance our competitive position 
industry overview and target markets we believe that significant opportunities exist for continued growth in the application of transaction processing services to the electronic commerce market 
although a large percentage of retail transactions still utilize cash  merchants encourage electronically authorized and settled transactions using credit and debit cards as a more efficient means of transacting business with their customers 
the rapid growth of retail credit card transactions  as well as the increased utilization of debit cards  directly correlates with the historic growth of our business 
in the united states  total consumer spending is expected to continue to increase  together with an increase in the percentage of consumers using forms of payment other than cash and checks ie  credit and debit cards and other electronic means 
based on the nilson report dated april  we believe that more than trillion of annual consumer spending is charged using visa and mastercard 
in canada  we expect to benefit from similar consumer spending trends 
based on the nilson report dated july  we also believe that over billion us of annual canadian consumer spending uses visa  mastercard or debit as the form of payment 
payment processing service providers  such as global payments  provide high volume electronic transaction processing and support services directly to banking institutions and to new entrants into the business 
the shift in the industry from traditional financial institution providers to independent providers is due in large part to more efficient distribution channels  as well as increased technological capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation  processing  handling  storage  and retrieval of information 
these capabilities have become increasingly complex  requiring significant capital commitments to develop  maintain  and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price 
as a result of the continued growth in our industry  several large merchant processors  including us  have expanded operations through the creation of alliances or joint ventures with banks and have acquired new merchant portfolios from banks that previously serviced these merchant accounts 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we believe that the proliferation of loyalty or co branded cards that provide consumers with added benefits for card use should contribute to increased use of credit and debit cards in the future 
additionally  as merchants and consumers continue to use electronic commerce as a means to purchase goods and services  both the consumer to business and business to business aspects of electronic commerce will demand a growing array of transaction processing and support services 
we currently provide complete processing capabilities for major credit cards  co branded credit cards  debit cards and purchasing cards and are continuing to research services to compliment new technology and demand 
business to business electronic data interchange using purchasing card technology and associated systems software provides businesses with increased efficiency and us with strong growth in industries that have not traditionally utilized credit cards 
purchasing cards and the related business to business electronic data interchange replace the costly  time consuming paper ordering and invoicing with inexpensive  real time electronic payment processing transactions 
visa has recently announced that they will begin offering cards containing chip technology in canada 
chip technology can securely store and encrypt confidential information 
the chip is virtually impossible to copy and has the power to be programmed with spending and usage limits making it possible to authorize transactions off line 
chip technology will enable a host of additional features including a choice of applications such as loyalty  access control  rewards  and public transit passes 
this complex project to offer chip technology in the canadian marketplace is expected to take up to seven years for all participants to implement the equipment necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions 
we have been working to develop a long term plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the canadian market 
we believe that the number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies  such as wireless payment products  stored value cards and other custom payment solutions 
we have focused on bringing niche wireless pos products and services into the mainstream 
today  we offer products that meet the needs of fixed location  portable and mobile merchants 
we have also participated in multiple wireless payment card pilots  also known as radio frequency identification  rfid or contact less payment card pilots  designed to decrease consumer checkout time allowing our merchants to service more customers and process more transactions 
we continue our development of a new electronic check system  which the industry sometimes refers to as check truncation or conversion  designed to further reduce our customer s paper handling cost by converting paper checks into an electronic ach file transaction 
in anticipation of the growing demand for internet communications by traditional merchants we are focused on developing new and secure solutions 
these emerging technologies will be a major factor in accelerating the continued conversion from paper transaction processing to electronic transaction processing  which will result in greater growth opportunities for our business 
strategy our business strategy centers on providing a full range of electronic transaction processing services in our existing markets and expanding into new markets through customer service  products and services  strategic acquisitions and new relationships with trade associations and agent banks 
we believe that this strategy provides us with the greatest opportunity for leveraging our existing infrastructure and maintaining a consistent base of recurring revenues 
we believe that the electronic commerce market presents additional attractive opportunities for continued growth 
in pursuing our business strategy  we seek to increase our penetration of existing markets  to continue to identify and create new markets  such as the electronic commerce market  and to further leverage our infrastructure through the following providing the best possible customer service by investing in technology  training and product enhancements  expanding distribution channels  primarily direct merchant services  isos  and caps  growing our domestic and canadian market share by concentrating on the mid market segment in the united states and on the small and mid market segment in canada

banking regulations canadian imperial bank of commerce  or cibc  owns of our common stock outstanding 
as a result of cibc s equity interest in our company  we are considered a subsidiary of cibc for us bank regulatory purposes 
cibc is a canadian bank with operations in the united states 
accordingly  cibc is regulated in the us as a foreign bank and  as a result  is subject to most of the same limitations as a us bank holding company under provisions of the bank holding company act 
as a subsidiary of cibc for us bank regulatory purposes  we are subject to those same regulations 
we are also subject to examination by the federal reserve board 
as a general matter  we are able to operate our merchant services and funds transfer businesses as we have historically  but our ability to expand into unrelated businesses may be limited unless they are activities that the bank holding company act allows or the federal reserve board approves 
bank holding companies may engage in the business of banking  managing and controlling banks  and in other activities so closely related to managing and controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
the gramm leach bliley act  enacted in  amended the bank holding company act to allow greater operational flexibility for bank holding companies that are well capitalized  well managed and meet certain other conditions 
such companies are referred to as financial holding companies 
financial holding companies may engage in activities that are financial in nature  or that are incidental or complimentary to financial activities 
the legislation defines securities and insurance activities as being permissible financial activities  allows certain merchant banking activities  and establishes a procedure for the federal reserve board  together with the us treasury department  to announce additional permissible activities 
as a foreign bank  cibc may qualify for financial holding company status and has done so 
if a financial holding company falls out of compliance with the well managed  well capitalized  community reinvestment requirements  it must enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to rectify the situation 
the federal reserve may refuse to allow the financial holding company  which would include its subsidiaries  to engage in new financial activities  may require it to cease current financial activities  and may require it to divest its bank 
the merchant services and funds transfer businesses that we conduct are permissible activities for bank holding companies as well as financial holding companies under us law  and we do not expect the limitations described above to adversely affect our current operations 
it is possible  however  that these restrictions might limit our ability to enter other businesses that we may wish to engage in at some time in the future 
it is also possible that these laws may be amended in the future  or new laws or regulations adopted  that adversely affect our ability to engage in our current or additional businesses 
additionally  cibc is subject to the bank act canada  which  among other things  limits the types of business which cibc may conduct  directly or indirectly  and the types of investments which cibc may make 
cibc s shareholding in our company is currently permitted under the bank act 
the bank act  except as we have discussed  does not otherwise apply to us 
under the bank act  cibc is permitted to continue to hold its interest in us  as long as the business undertaken by us is consistent with the applicable provisions of the bank act 
if we undertake businesses inconsistent with the businesses in which cibc is permitted to hold an interest  cibc may be required  pursuant to the provisions of the bank act  to dispose of its shares prior to the expiration of the restrictions on re sale that we have negotiated with cibc

we do not anticipate that compliance with this undertaking will affect  in any material way  our ability to carry on the merchant services and funds transfer businesses 
our ability to expand into other businesses will be governed by the undertaking and the applicable provisions of canadian banking legislation at the relevant time 
there is no assurance that subsequent amendments to the bank act will not adversely affect our ability to carry on our business in some respects
