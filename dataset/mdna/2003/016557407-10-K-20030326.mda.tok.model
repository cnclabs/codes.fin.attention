item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes  a postretirement benefit obligation and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgement  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss  and when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the company generally recognizes revenue at the time of shipment 
sales are reflected net of discounts and returns 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is a deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on an average cost basis or market 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions as well as the company s distribution agreements with its suppliers  which generally provide for price protection and obsolescence credits  inventories are written down to market value 
if our assumptions about future demand change  and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
deferred tax assets are recorded based on the company s projected future taxable income and the resulting utilization of the deferred tax assets 
to the extent that the company would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be necessary and charged to income 
the company calculates a postretirement benefit obligation using actuarial life expectancy tables and an assumed discount rate 
if the assumptions used in this calculation change  an adjustment to the postretirement benefit obligation may be required 
loss contingencies arise in the ordinary course of business 
in determining loss contingencies  we evaluate the likelihood of the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of such loss 
we accrue for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
results of operations overview the following table sets forth for the years ended december   and  certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales 
all percentages are based on net sales 
items as a percentage of net sales years ended december net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill income loss from continuing operations interest expense other income net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations before discontinued operations discontinued operations net income loss not meaningful comparison of years ended december  and sales net sales for the year ended december  were million  a decrease from net sales of million for the decrease was primarily attributable to a continuation of the industry downturn that began during the fourth quarter of and progressively and significantly worsened throughout net sales were also negatively impacted by a weakness in demand for electronic components  a trend of electronics manufacturing to move offshore as well as the general weakness in the overall economy 
management expects that the weakness in market conditions may continue through much of additionally  management expects that the trend for electronics manufacturing to move offshore  where the company currently has very limited sales presence  will continue 
gross profit gross profit was million for  a decrease from gross profit of million for  without giving effect to non cash inventory write offs during aggregating million resulting from adverse industry conditions see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to decreases in net sales and gross profit margins 
gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales were for compared to for  excluding from the period the inventory write offs described above 
the decline in gross profit margins reflects the continued weakness in demand for electronic components  excess product availability as well as a change in our product mix  including an increase in sales of flat panel displays which generally sell at lower gross margins 
in addition  we continue to develop long term strategic relationships with accounts that have required aggressive pricing programs and we expect a greater number of low margin  large volume transactions 
management therefore expects that the downward pressure on gross profit margins may continue 
after giving effect to the inventory write offs during described above  gross profit was million and the gross profit margin was for selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million for from million for without giving effect to million of write offs during of accounts receivable resulting from the adverse economic and industry conditions 
the improvement in sg a reflects the benefit from the implementation of certain expense reduction programs  including workforce and salary reductions  all of which began during the second quarter of the decrease in sg a also reflects a reduction in variable expenses associated with the decline in sales and gross profit dollars 
after giving effect to the write offs during of certain accounts receivable  sg a was million for sg a as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the period without giving effect to the write offs of accounts receivable during the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales was due to the improvement in sg a in absolute dollars discussed above which more than offset the impact from the decline in net sales 
after taking into account the write offs during of accounts receivable  sg a as a percentage of net sales was for income loss from continuing operations income from continuing operations was million for compared to million for excluding the non cash charges during for inventory and accounts receivable write offs discussed above and also excluding an  non cash write off of goodwill in see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in income from continuing operations was due to the significant decline in sales and gross profit dollars for the reasons discussed previously  which decreases were partially offset by the improvement in sg a described above 
after giving effect to the non cash charges in  the company had a loss from continuing operations of million for other income in september  the company entered into an agreement with a customer the agreement to whom the company had previously supplied display integration and turnkey support 
the agreement provided  among other things  that the company release the then existing indebtedness of the customer  which indebtedness had been previously written off by the company during  and certain related security interests 
in consideration of these releases  the company received approximately million in cash and  shares  
par value per share  of common stock of this customer 
these shares are not registered under the securities act of and are not publicly traded 
the shares are subject to a voting arrangement outside the control of the company 
as a result of the voting arrangement  the company has given up substantially all of its voting rights 
the company has reflected the value of these shares in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the value of these shares was based on an independent appraisal at  as of the date these shares were received by the company 
the combined value of the cash and stock  together with lease payments that the company previously collected from leases that were pledged to the company as collateral for the then existing indebtedness of the customer  aggregated approximately million  after deducting related legal expenses associated with the transaction 
this amount is reflected as other income on the consolidated statement of operations for interest expense interest expense decreased significantly to million for compared to million for  without giving effect in to  of a non cash write off of deferred financing fees in connection with changes in the company s credit facility during after giving effect to the non cash write off  interest expense was million for the substantial decrease in interest expense resulted from significant decreases in our average borrowings and decreases in overall interest rates 
our average borrowings decreased by approximately million when comparing and the decrease in average borrowings was due to decreases in our inventory and income taxes receivable as well as from the positive effects of our expense reduction programs 
net income loss net income was million  or 
per share diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december  after giving effect to the non cash charges as discussed above 
in addition  also includes the loss on disposal of million on a pre tax basis including a write off of million of inventory and million of accounts receivable  or million after tax  associated with the discontinuance of our aved display technologies and integrated display technologies divisions in june of see comparison of years ended december  and discontinued operations below 
comparison of years ended december  and sales net sales for the year ended december  were million  representing a decrease over record sales of million for the decrease was primarily attributable to a severe broad based industry downturn  weakness in demand for electronic components as well as the general weakness in the overall economy 
gross profit without giving effect to non cash inventory write offs during aggregating million resulting from adverse industry conditions see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  gross profit was million for  representing a decrease from gross profit of million for the decrease was due to the significant decline in sales as well as the decrease in gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit margins as a percentage of net sales  without giving effect to the inventory write offs  were for compared to for the decline in gross profit margins reflected the severe industry downturn  weakness in demand for electronic components and excess product availability 
in addition  we continued to develop long term strategic relationships with accounts that required aggressive pricing programs 
after giving effect to the inventory write offs  gross profit dollars were million and the gross profit margin was for selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  without giving effect to million of write offs of accounts receivable resulting from the adverse economic and industry conditions  was million for compared to million for the improvement in sg a reflected the implementation of certain expense reduction programs  including workforce and salary reductions which began during the first half of the improvement also reflected a reduction in variable expenses associated with the decline in sales and gross profit dollars 
after giving effect to the accounts receivable write offs  sg a was million for without giving effect to the write offs of accounts receivable  sg a as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the period 
the increase in sg a as a percentage of net sales reflected the significant decline in sales  slightly offset by the improvement in sg a discussed above

income loss from continuing operations excluding the non cash charges during for inventory and accounts receivable write offs discussed above and also excluding an  non cash write off of goodwill see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  income from continuing operations was million for  compared to income from continuing operations of million for the decrease in income from continuing operations excluding the non cash charges was primarily attributable to decreases in sales and gross profit dollars resulting from the severe industry downturn  which decreases were partially offset by the improvement in sg a described above 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
after giving effect to the previously mentioned non cash charges the company had a loss from continuing operations of million for interest expense interest expense  without giving effect to  of a non cash write off of deferred financing fees in connection with changes in the company s credit facility during  was million for compared to million for after giving effect to such non cash write off  interest expense was million for the decrease in interest expense before the non cash write off resulted from a decrease in overall interest rates as well as from a significant decline in our average borrowings during the significant decline in our borrowings during was primarily attributable to the decreases in inventory and accounts receivable during the second half of the year 
these factors more than offset the impact from an increase in our interest rate margins during under the company s line of credit agreement

discontinued operations due to the overall weakness in the economy  the negative impact of the severe broad based industry downturn and other factors  aved display technologies and integrated display technologies did not generate the cash flows anticipated 
as a result  during  management decided to discontinue these divisions 
accordingly  these divisions are accounted for as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the loss on disposal of million on a pretax basis million after tax included the estimated costs and expenses associated with the disposal of million primarily made up of the write off of million of inventory and million of accounts receivable 
in addition  the loss on disposal included a provision of  on a pretax basis for operating losses during the phase out period which continued for approximately two months 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
net income loss after giving effect to the non cash charges and the loss from discontinued operations  all as discussed above  the company had a net loss of million  or per share diluted  for the year ended december   compared to a record net income of million  or per share diluted  for quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information

liquidity and capital resources working capital at december  decreased to million from working capital of million at december  the current ratio was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to decreases in inventory and income taxes receivable which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable 
accounts receivable was million at december  and the average number of days that accounts receivables were outstanding improved to days as of december  as compared to days as of december  this improvement reflects a greater amount of time devoted to collection efforts as a result of a decline in sales activity as well as the write off of certain accounts in due to the weakened economic environment and adverse industry conditions 
the improvement also reflects certain large customers paying early in order to take advantage of discount terms 
inventory levels were million at december   down from million at december  the substantial decrease in inventory reflects our sustained efforts to bring inventory positions in line with the reduced level of sales 
accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to million at december  from million at december  as a result of reduced purchases in connection with the reduced level of sales 
in august  the company s board of directors authorized the continuance of the stock repurchase program  originally approved by the board and announced in  which provided for the repurchase of up to million in purchase price of the company s common stock 
the stock repurchases may  at the discretion of the company s management  be made from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the company s management will base its decision on market conditions  the price of its common stock and other factors 
the company currently intends to make stock repurchases using available cash flow from operations and or available borrowings under its line of credit 
any shares of common stock repurchased will be available for reissuance in connection with the employees  officers  directors stock option plan  as previously amended and restated the option plan  or for other corporate purposes 
for the year ended december   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock at an average price of per share  or an aggregate price of approximately  which  together with previous purchases since  represents  shares at an aggregate price of approximately  purchased under the program 
there were no repurchases for the year ended december  the aggregate cost of the repurchased shares was reflected as treasury stock prior to december  and  as of december   all treasury stock was retired 
outstanding borrowings under the company s line of credit facility aggregated million at december  compared to million at december  the dramatic decline in outstanding borrowings reflects the decrease in working capital discussed previously 
during the credit facility was amended to reduce the line of credit from million to million to better match the company s present borrowing requirements 
the credit facility was previously amended in to reduce the line of credit from million to million and in to reduce the line of credit from million to million 
the reductions in the credit facility benefit the company by decreasing the amount of the fee charged on the unused portion of the credit facility 
in addition  during the interest rate margins on the company s credit facility were increased 
during the interest rate margins were  at the company s option  for the prime rate portion  or through march  and effective march  for the libor portion 
accordingly  at december   the interest rate margins were for the prime rate portion and for the libor portion 
under the credit facility  the company is required to comply with certain affirmative and negative covenants  certain of which were modified in in connection with the foregoing amendments  as well as to comply with certain financial ratios 
these covenants  among other things  place limitations and restrictions on the company s borrowings  investments and transactions with affiliates and prohibit dividends and stock redemptions unless consented to by the lenders  which consent has been obtained in connection with the company s stock repurchase program 
the credit facility requires the company to maintain certain minimum levels of tangible net worth throughout the term of the agreement and a minimum debt service coverage ratio which is tested on a quarterly basis 
borrowings under the credit facility  which are based on eligible accounts receivable and inventories as defined in the agreement  are secured by all of the company s assets including accounts receivable  inventories and equipment 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in september  the company entered into an agreement with a customer which provided  among other things  that the company release the then existing indebtedness of the customer  which indebtedness had been previously written off by the company primarily in the nine month period ended september   and certain related security interests 
in consideration of these releases  the company received approximately million in cash in addition to certain stock and other consideration 
the net cash proceeds received were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the company s credit facility 
the company continues to guarantee the future payment to a third party of certain leases which were previously pledged to the company as collateral for the payment of outstanding receivables which were owed by this customer 
this guaranty was made when the leases were sold to this third party who paid to the company the net present value of the future payments of the leases 
the maximum exposure under this guaranty was approximately  with a net present value of  at december  the company also has million of subordinated debentures which mature in june  as well as other subordinated debt with various maturities through aggregating approximately  and an unfunded postretirement benefit obligation of approximately  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to its borrowings under its line of credit facility and other long term debt obligations reflected in the consolidated financial statements  the company has operating leases for office space  distribution facilities and equipment that have initial or remaining noncancelable lease terms in excess of one year as of december  the amounts of the company s obligations with respect to operating leases are approximately million  million  million  million and million for each of the years ending december     and  respectively 
see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company currently expects that its cash flows from operations and additional borrowings available under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet the company s current financial requirements over the next twelve months 
inflation and currency fluctuations the company does not believe that inflation significantly impacted its business during  however  inflation has had significant effects on the economy in the past and could adversely impact the company s results in the future especially as the company expands internationally 
the company believes that currency fluctuations could have adverse effects on its business if they make components manufactured abroad too expensive  cause limitations in customer productions due to unfavorable export conditions or cause the company s offshore suppliers to limit exports to the united states 
in certain prior years  the company believes that currency fluctuations have had such adverse effects

our industry is cyclical  which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly 
in the fall of  our industry emerged from a four year period of excess supply 
as a result of limited supply from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  prices and profit margins went up and our operating results improved 
during the fourth quarter of  a combination of improved product availability  a slowing economy and other factors caused a sudden adverse change in market conditions in our industry  which continued to deteriorate during resulting in a broad based industry slowdown  excess customer inventory and a severe decline in demand for electronic components which continued during and into we cannot predict the timing or the severity of the cycles within our industry 
in particular and as of this time  it is difficult to predict how long and to what levels any industry slowdown or downturn and or general economic weakness will last or be exacerbated by terrorism or war 
the electronic components distribution industry has historically been affected by general economic downturns  which have often had an adverse economic effect upon manufacturers  end users of electronic components and electronic components distributors  which occurred in and and continues in in addition  our industry directly depends on the continued growth of the electronic components industry and indirectly on the level of end user demand for our customers products 
due to changing conditions such as in late and all of  our customer base has experienced in and and may in the future continue to experience periods of inventory corrections which could materially adversely impact our results 
furthermore  the timing of new product developments  the life cycle of existing electronic products  and the level of acceptance and growth of new products can affect demand for electronic components 
in that regard  the company has supported in the past and expects in the future to support new technologies and emerging markets  the failure of which to be accepted or grow as was the situation during and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
these market changes and factors have caused in the past including in  and will likely cause in the future  our operating results to significantly fluctuate 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers 
if one or more of our largest suppliers chooses not to sell products to us  our operating results could suffer 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for products which generate a significant portion of our sales 
substantially all of our inventory has and will be purchased from suppliers with which we have entered into non exclusive distributor agreements which are typically cancelable on short notice generally to days 
products purchased from our three largest suppliers accounted for approximately of our consolidated purchases during the calendar year ended december   of which were purchased from one supplier 
no other supplier accounted for more than six percent of our consolidated purchases during this period 
while most of the products that we sell are available from other sources  our future success will depend in large part on maintaining relationships with existing suppliers and developing relationships with new ones 
we believe that the loss of a key supplier particularly our largest supplier could have a material adverse impact on our business in the short term as we attempt to replace the products offered by that supplier with the products of other suppliers 
however  if we were to lose our right to distribute the products of any particular supplier  there can be no assurance that we would be able to replace the products which were available from that particular supplier 
the loss of  or significant disruptions in relationships with  any of our largest suppliers particularly our largest supplier or a significant number of other suppliers in a short period of time  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers and  as a result  our customers may be able to cancel  reduce or delay their orders without penalty 
we typically do not obtain long term purchase orders or commitments but instead work with our customers to develop nonbinding forecasts of future orders 
based on such nonbinding forecasts  we make commitments regarding the level of business that we will seek and accept  and the levels and utilization of personnel and other resources 
a variety of conditions  both specific to each individual customer and generally affecting each customer s industry  may cause our customers to cancel  reduce or delay orders that were either previously made or anticipated or attempt to return inventory 
generally  our customers may cancel  reduce or delay purchase orders and commitments without penalty or other charges associated with such cancellation  reduction or delay 
significant or numerous cancellations  reductions or delays in orders by customers have in and to a lesser extent in had  and could in the future have  a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may not be able to sustain or manage growth or achieve satisfactory levels of profitability 
as and when market conditions improve and if and as we commence our growth  we will need to manage our expanding operations effectively and successfully integrate into our operations any new businesses or divisions which we may acquire or open 
if we are unable to do so  particularly in instances in which we have made or make significant investments  our failure could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be unsuccessful in growing and achieving satisfactory levels of profitability if we are unable to secure adequate supplies of competitive products on a timely basis and on commercially reasonable terms  especially in times of product allocations  expand sales to existing customers and increase our customer base  turn our inventories and collect our accounts receivable fully and consistent with historical bad debt levels prior to and in a timely manner  especially with respect to customers in new technologies or in emerging markets and generally as a result of the weakened or further weakening financial condition of certain customers including several customer bankruptcies  avoid obsolescence of inventory or devaluation of inventory as a result of continuing adverse market conditions  maintain our existing key supplier relationships as well as develop new relationships with leading suppliers of electronic components  hire and retain additional qualified management  marketing and other personnel to successfully manage our growth  including personnel to monitor our operations  control costs and maintain effective inventory and credit controls  effectively and fully utilize our level of personnel and facility and infrastructure overcapacity  and invest to maintain and enhance our infrastructure  including telecommunications and information systems  logistics services and our service capabilities  including distribution technology 
a decline in gross profit margins arising from a change in market conditions or aggressive pricing programs could adversely affect our operating results 
during certain prior periods  we have experienced an increase in gross profit margins as a result of favorable market conditions in the electronic components distribution industry  including limited supply of certain products 
however  there is no assurance that negative changes in the economic environment generally and or in the electronic components industry in particular will not occur 
in fact  such negative changes in both the economic environment generally and in the electronic components industry began to occur in the fourth quarter of  progressively worsened throughout and remained weak during furthermore  we continue to develop long term strategic relationships with accounts which have required aggressive pricing programs 
these factors could result in a decline in our gross profit margins  materially adversely affecting our operating results 
we may not be able to satisfy our funding requirements 
we may need to spend significant amounts of cash to fund operating losses and or increases in expenses  meet our working capital requirements  invest in capital equipment and infrastructure  upgrade our information and communication systems  acquire businesses or open divisions  or respond to unanticipated developments  increasing customer demands or competitive pressures 
if we do not have enough cash on hand  cash generated from our operations or cash available under our credit facility to meet these cash requirements  we will need to seek alternative sources of financing to carry out our growth and operating strategies 
we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive 
if alternative sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable  we will be required to modify our operating plans to the extent of available funding  if and assuming such modifications can be made at all 
we are dependent on foreign manufacturers and subject to trade regulations which expose us to political and economic risk 
a significant number of components sold by us are manufactured by foreign companies 
as a result  our ability to sell certain products at competitive prices could be adversely affected by any of the following increases in tariffs or duties  changes in trade treaties  strikes or delays in air or sea transportation  future united states legislation with respect to pricing and or import quotas on products imported from foreign countries  and turbulence in offshore economies or financial markets 
our ability to be competitive with respect to sales of imported components could also be affected by other governmental actions and policy changes  including anti dumping and other international antitrust legislation 
in addition  adverse currency fluctuations could have the effect of making components manufactured abroad more expensive  cause limitations in customer productions due to unfavorable export conditions or cause our offshore suppliers to limit exports to the united states 
because we purchase substantially all of our products from united states subsidiaries and affiliates of foreign manufacturers  almost all of our purchases are paid for in us dollars  which usually reduces or eliminates the potential adverse effects of currency fluctuations 
however  in late we began purchasing a limited amount of our product offshore and this offshore purchasing activity may increase in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such factors could not have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the future 
our industry is subject to supply shortages 
any delay or inability to obtain components may have an adverse effect on our operating results 
at various times prior to there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry and the availability of certain components have been limited by some of our suppliers 
although such shortages and allocations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results  there can be no assurance that any future shortages or allocations would not have such an effect on us 
the prices of our components are subject to volatility 
a significant portion of the memory products we sell have historically experienced volatile pricing 
if market pricing for these products decreases significantly  we may experience periods when our investment in inventory exceeds the market price of such products 
in addition  at times there are price increases from our suppliers that we are unable to pass on to our customers 
these market conditions could have a negative impact on our sales and gross profit margins unless and until our suppliers reduce the cost of these products to us 
further  in the future aggressive pricing programs that may be required  an increased number of low margin  large volume transactions and or increased availability of the supply of certain products can further impact gross profit margins 
our industry is highly competitive and competition could harm our ability to sell our products and services and thereby reduce our market share 
the electronic components distribution industry is highly competitive 
we generally compete with local  regional and national distributors 
some of our competitors have greater name recognition and financial  personnel and other resources than we do 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to compete successfully with existing or new competitors and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
emergence of new competitive business models could have adverse effects on our business 
in the last couple of years  additional competition has emerged in the electronic components distribution industry 
this increased competition resulted in part from the advent of third party logistics and fulfillment companies  businesses commonly referred to as e exchanges and e brokers and several other forms of e commerce companies which have grown with the expanded use of the internet 
in addition to the increased competition from these other groups  some of the total available distribution market share is being reduced as more and more original equipment manufacturers transition their procurement into ems companies and original design manufacturers 
the ems companies and original design manufacturers utilize their abilities to aggregate demand to develop direct purchasing channels with component manufacturers 
furthermore  as more and more manufacturing moves outside the boundaries of north america  the company believes that the total available distribution market share is also being reduced as procurement channels increase in asia and europe 
while we have implemented our e commerce strategies  including our website and multiple portals  to confront certain of these new competitive business models  there can be no assurance that we will be able to defend our market share against the emergence of these or other new business models 
a reversal of the trend for distribution to play an increasing role in the electronic components industry could affect our business 
in recent years  there has been a growing trend for original equipment manufacturers and contract electronics manufacturers to outsource their procurement  inventory and materials management processes to third parties  particularly electronic component distributors 
although we do not currently foresee this trend reversing  if it did  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we are exposed to interest rate changes which could adversely affect our operating results 
we are exposed to interest rate changes with respect to our credit facility  which currently is based upon  at our option  the prime rate or libor 
in fact  interest rates are currently at a very low level and no assurance can be given that interest rates will not begin to rise as the general economy commences its recovery 
any material increase in the level of interest rates could materially adversely affect our operating results 
our operations would be adversely affected if third party carriers were unable to transport or were materially hindered in transporting our products 
all of our products are shipped through third party carriers  principally one carrier 
if a strike or other event prevented or materially hindered or disrupted that carrier from transporting our products  there is no assurance that other carriers would be available or have the capacity to deliver our products to our customers 
if adequate third party sources to ship our products were not available at any time  our operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
we depend on the continued services of our executive officers  and their loss could affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
we are highly dependent upon the services of our president and chief executive officer 
the permanent loss for any reason of our president and chief executive officer  or any one or more of our other key executives  could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 
while we believe that we would be able to locate suitable replacements for our executives if their services were lost  there can be no assurance that we would  in fact  be able to do so 
we must attract and retain personnel to help support our future growth  and competition for personnel in our industry has previously been intense 
we require the services of a substantial number of qualified personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management  engineering  sales  marketing  information technology  distribution and finance personnel 
prior to late  the market for such skilled and experienced personnel was characterized by intense competition and aggressive recruiting  as well as a high degree of employee mobility 
such a market  if it was to return  would make it particularly difficult to attract and retain the qualified personnel we require 
the loss of or our inability to continue to attract and retain these key personnel could harm our business 
any acquisitions could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business and adversely affect our operations 
our growth in the future may depend  in part  on our ability to acquire compatible electronic components distributors or other businesses and to integrate the acquired operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to locate additional appropriate acquisition candidates  or that we will be successful in acquiring any identified candidates 
in addition and as we have experienced in the past  we cannot be certain that the operations of any acquired companies will be effectively integrated or prove profitable 
the completion of future acquisitions may require the expenditure of sizable amounts of capital and management effort 
moreover  unexpected problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we may be exposed to product liability claims 
we are likely to be named as a defendant in any products liability action brought by an end user as a result of our value added services or as a participant in the distribution chain between the manufacturer and end user 
although as of this date there are no material claims asserted against us for products liability  there can be no assurance that such claims will not arise in the future 
in the event that any products liability claim is not covered by insurance or we are not indemnified by or cannot recover damages from our supplier of the product or another third party in the chain of distribution  we may be required to fund some or all of a product liability claim  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we may be exposed to warranty claims 
the company may be exposed to warranty claims by its customers both with respect to products manufactured by others which the company distributes and with respect to products on which the company has performed value added work 
with respect to claims relating to products manufactured by others  the company would expect that the manufacturers of such products would indemnify the company to the extent provided for under its agreement with the manufacturer  as well as defend such claims on the company s behalf  although no assurance can be given that any manufacturer would so do 
in addition  there may be instances where a customer might be able to enforce an express or implied warranty claim against the company with respect to component products manufactured by the company s suppliers  in addition to or in lieu of the warranties of the suppliers of such components 
accordingly  a significant number of such warranty claims could have a material adverse effect on us 
our global expansion initiatives may not be successful 
the company recently commenced global expansion initiatives in an attempt to increase its sales to customers in foreign countries 
given the company s limited experience in the international market and that the company only recently  and on a limited basis so far  commenced operations outside of north america  no assurance can be given that the company s global expansion initiatives will be successful 
our officers and directors have and will continue to have significant control over us 
if the company s chairman and president and chief executive officer exercised all of their outstanding stock options  they and their respective spouses and children and related trusts would own an aggregate of approximately  shares  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result of such stock ownership and their positions as executive officers  as the members of the executive committee of our board of directors and as two of the seven directors of all american  they are and will continue to be in a position to control the day to day affairs of all american 
our shareholder rights plan  preferred stock and governing documents may discourage potential acquisitions of our business 
we have a shareholders rights plan and have authorized preferred stock which is available to be issued with such rights  preferences  privileges and limitations as are determined by the board of directors 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation includes provisions designed to discourage attempts by others to acquire control of us without negotiation with our board of directors  and to attempt to ensure that such transactions are on terms favorable to all of our shareholders 
these provisions provide  among other things that meetings of our shareholders may only be called by the board of directors  that an affirmative vote of two thirds of our outstanding shares of common stock is required to approve certain business combinations unless of our board approves such transaction  for three classes of directors with each class elected for a three year staggered term  that our board in evaluating a tender offer or certain business combinations is authorized to give due consideration to all relevant factors  and that actions of shareholders may not be taken by written consent of shareholders in lieu of a meeting 
for various reasons  however  these provisions may not always be in the best interest of our shareholders 
these reasons include the fact that the provisions of our certificate of incorporation i make it difficult to remove directors even if removal would be in the best interest of our shareholders  ii make it difficult for our shareholders to approve certain transactions that are not approved by at least of our board  even if the transactions would be beneficial to our shareholders  and iii eliminate the ability of our shareholders to act without a meeting 
our shareholder rights plan  our blank check preferred stock and our governing documents may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control of all american  could discourage potential investors from bidding for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and could adversely affect the market price and the voting rights of the holders of the common stock
