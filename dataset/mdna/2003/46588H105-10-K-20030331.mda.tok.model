goodwill goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis

 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for the long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions of sfas regarding the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
the company reviews for impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in general  the company will recognize an impairment when the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of such assets 
the measurement for such impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
fixed assets depreciation of equipment  furniture and fixtures  and computer software is provided for by the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to five years

ivillage s contracts with procter and gamble and unilever expire in june and ivillage s contract with hearst expires in june ivillage can make no assurances as to whether these expiring contracts will be renewed  or if so renewed  that they will be on similar terms as the expiring agreements 
because ivillage s largest customers have varied over time in the past  ivillage anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future

liquidity and capital resources financial reporting release no 
 released by the sec  requires all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
ivillage currently does not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   ivillage had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of restricted cash 
cash equivalents include money market accounts 
the restricted cash includes money held for a letter of credit collateralizing a real estate lease for ivillage s new york office space 
ivillage maintains its cash and cash equivalents in highly rated financial institutions and at times these balances exceed insurable amounts 
ivillage has sustained net losses and negative cash flows from operations since its inception and expects to continue to incur such losses in the near future 
ivillage s ability to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business is dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and or raise additional financing through public or private equity financing  collaborative or other arrangements with corporate sources  through the launch of new subscription or other revenue generating initiatives or other sources of financing to fund operations

management believes that ivillage s current funds will be sufficient to enable it to meet ivillage s planned expenditures through the next twelve months 
if anticipated operating results are not achieved  management believes it has the ability to delay or reduce expenditures  so as not to require additional financial resources if such resources were not available on terms acceptable to ivillage  although there can be no assurances in this regard

in february  ivillage announced a further expense reduction initiative with the goal of reducing annualized costs by approximately million 
ivillage expects to achieve these savings through a reduction of the costs it pays to outside vendors  further real estate consolidation and additional employee staff reductions 
ivillage s ability to maintain a cash balance at december  comparable to its cash balance at december  is dependent upon ivillage s ability to implement these cost reductions  increase advertising  sponsorship  subscription and other revenues  and or raise additional financing

com acquisition  a larger decrease in restricted cash and other assets in of approximately million primarily due to the one time charge for the termination of an agreement with nbc  and an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million in as compared to a decrease of approximately million in the decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses excluding the impairment of goodwill of approximately million  partially offset by the adoption of sfas which resulted in a change of accounting principle charge of approximately million in the first quarter of in connection with the transitional impairment test and an approximately million goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of associated with the annual impairment test 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   and cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  the overall increase in net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  compared to the comparable period in was primarily due to the acquisition of women

currently  unilever can exercise a put option to require ivillage to purchase unilever s remaining ownership interest in the venture for fair market value at any time 
at any time  ivillage can exercise a call option to require unilever to sell its remaining interest in the venture to ivillage for fair market value  provided  however  that unilever can exercise a call option superior to ivillage s call option to purchase a portion of ivillage s interest in the venture for fair market value  up to a limit of of the venture s ownership 
these put and call options must be paid in cash 
if ivillage was required to purchase unilever s remaining ownership interest in the venture pursuant to the exercise of one of these options  ivillage does not believe the amount of cash payable would be material and expects that it would fund this obligation with its working capital 
in addition  at any time  unilever can exercise a call option to purchase a portion of ivillage s membership interest in the venture for fair market value  up to a limit of of the venture s ownership 
ivillage anticipates exercising its call option during as a result of the purchase transaction described above  ivillage gained operational control of the venture and the venture was consolidated within ivillage s financial statements beginning in march ivillage s february advertising agreement with unilever  as amended  provides for a unilever advertising purchase commitment of million 
through december   ivillage has earned approximately million under the advertising agreement with the remaining approximately million to be earned between the period january  through june  pursuant to an amended and restated magazine content license and hosting agreement with hearst  hearst has committed to purchase from ivillage between approximately million and million of production and advertising services over a three year period beginning in june this agreement also provides for revenue sharing between hearst and ivillage with respect to advertising revenues obtained by ivillage from the hearst magazine web sites and ivillage s other web sites containing substantial hearst content 
this revenue sharing arrangement requires that ivillage pay hearst a royalty payment  based on net advertising revenues  of at least approximately million during the three year term of the agreement 
this amount would be reduced on a pro rata basis if hearst fails to expend its stated annual minimum in production fees in any year of the agreement 
in addition  if a shortfall in production fees occurs in any year of the agreement  then hearst must place additional advertising in an amount equal to of the production fee shortfall

risk factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones faced by ivillage 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to ivillage or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this form k 
ivillage may face difficulties encountered in the new and rapidly evolving markets in which it operates 
ivillage faces many of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered in new and rapidly evolving markets  including the internet advertising and consumer products and services markets 
these risks and difficulties include ivillage s ability to o attract a larger audience to the ivillage network of web sites  o increase awareness of the ivillage brand and ivillage branded products and services  o strengthen user loyalty  o offer compelling content and desirable consumer products and services  o maintain current  and develop new  strategic relationships  o attract a large number of advertisers from a variety of industries  o respond effectively to competitive pressures  o continue to develop and upgrade ivillage s technology  and o attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
ivillage has not achieved profitability and has recent and anticipated continuing losses 
ivillage has not achieved profitability and ivillage expects to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
ivillage incurred net losses of approximately million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  as of december   ivillage s accumulated deficit was approximately million 
ivillage cannot make any assurances that it will achieve sufficient revenues for profitability 
even if ivillage does achieve profitability  ivillage cannot make any assurances that it will be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
if revenues grow slower than ivillage anticipates  or if operating expenses exceed ivillage s expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  its business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
because ivillage s strategy includes acquisitions of  and joint ventures with  other businesses  acquisition and joint venture expenses and any cash used to make these acquisitions and joint ventures will reduce its available cash 
ivillage has a small number of major customers and the loss of a number of these customers could adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage depends on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of its revenues 
for the years ended december  and  respectively  revenues from ivillage s five largest customers accounted for approximately and of total revenues 
in  procter and gamble  hearst and unilever accounted for approximately  and of total revenues  respectively 
in  unilever accounted for approximately of total revenues 
at december   procter and gamble accounted for approximately of the net accounts receivable  and at december   hearst and unilever accounted for approximately and of the net accounts receivable  respectively 
ivillage anticipates that its results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on revenues from a small number of customers 
additionally  ivillage s contracts with procter and gamble and unilever expire in june and ivillage s contract with hearst expires in june ivillage can make no assurances as to whether the expiring contracts of procter and gamble  unilever and hearst will be renewed  or if so renewed  that they will be on similar terms as the existing agreements 
because ivillage s largest customers have varied over time in the past  ivillage anticipates that they will continue to do so in the future 
consequently  the loss of even a small number of ivillage s largest customers at any one time may adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations  unless ivillage is able to enter into a sufficient number of new comparable contracts 
ivillage s common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market and  if delisted  trading in ivillage s common stock would decrease substantially and the market price of ivillage s common stock may decline further 
on december   ivillage s common stock was transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market after having failed to qualify for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
this transfer was necessitated by ivillage s failure to maintain a minimum per share bid price of for consecutive trading days after receipt of a letter dated september  from the nasdaq stock market  inc nasdaq 
ivillage currently has until september  to regain compliance with the nasdaq smallcap market s minimum per share bid price requirement 
in the event that ivillage s common stock fails to maintain a minimum per share bid price of for a minimum of consecutive trading days during such grace period  ivillage may receive written notification that its securities will be delisted pursuant to nasdaq s listing requirements or may receive an additional days to demonstrate compliance if ivillage then meets the initial listing criteria for the nasdaq small cap market 
in the event that ivillage s common stock maintains a minimum per share bid price of for a minimum of consecutive days and meets the other listing requirements  ivillage may apply to be reinstated on the nasdaq national market 
in the event that  after september   ivillage receives written notification that its securities will be delisted  ivillage may appeal the nasdaq staff s determination to a nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
if ivillage s common stock is delisted from trading  the market price of ivillage s common stock may decline further  possibly to zero  and it may have a material adverse effect on the ability of ivillage s stockholders to sell their shares 
the delisting of ivillage s common stock would also make it more difficult for ivillage to raise additional financing 
ivillage s quarterly and annual revenues and operating results are not indicative of future performance  are difficult to forecast and have been and are likely to continue to fluctuate 
ivillage does not believe that period to period comparisons of its operating results are necessarily meaningful nor should they be relied upon as reliable indicators of future performance  thus making it difficult to forecast quarterly and annual revenues and results of operations 
in addition  ivillage s operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly from fiscal quarter to quarter  and year to year  as a result of several factors  many of which are outside ivillage s control  and any of which could materially harm ivillage s business 
these factors include o fluctuations in the demand for advertising or electronic commerce  o the unpredictability of ivillage s success in its new revenue and cost reduction initiatives  o bankruptcies or other payment defaults of companies that are a source of revenues  o volatility in the media market and the high number of companies decreasing their marketing budgets  o changes in the level of traffic on its network of web sites  and o fluctuations in marketing expenses and technology infrastructure costs 
ivillage s revenues for the foreseeable future will remain primarily dependent on user traffic levels and advertising activity on its web sites 
future revenues are difficult to forecast 
ivillage may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected reduction in revenues in a particular fiscal quarter or year  which may materially and adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
in one or more future fiscal quarters or years  ivillage s results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if ivillage s results of operations fall below expectations  the trading price of its common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
in addition  if the revenues of ivillage in any particular fiscal period are lower than anticipated  ivillage may be unable to reduce spending in that fiscal period 
if ivillage has a shortfall in revenues in relation to its expenses  then ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
ivillage may need to raise additional capital and its prospects for obtaining additional financing are uncertain 
ivillage currently anticipates that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet its anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  the amount of cash and cash equivalents that ivillage will need in the future cannot be accurately predicted and depends on many factors  including the amount of revenues received and expenses incurred in connection with the operation of its business 
accordingly  ivillage may need to raise additional funds in the future to fund its operations 
ivillage can make no assurances that additional financing will be available to ivillage on acceptable terms  or at all 
in particular  unless the market price of ivillage s common stock increases dramatically  it is unlikely that ivillage will be able to raise funds through a public offering of its common stock 
due to ivillage s lack of profitability  it is also unlikely that ivillage would be able to obtain any bank financing 
if anticipated operating results are not achieved  management of ivillage has the intent and believes it has the ability to delay or reduce expenditures so as not to require additional financial resources if those resources were not available on terms acceptable to ivillage  although ivillage can make no assurances in this regard 
the downturn in the economy has raised uncertainties concerning ivillage s business prospects 
as a result of the national economy s slowdown  many of ivillage s customers have experienced difficulty in maintaining their current operations and implementing their business plans 
many of these customers have reduced their spending on ivillage s products and services  and or may not be able to discharge their current payables and other obligations to ivillage 
the non payment or late payment of amounts due to ivillage from a significant customer  or the non payment or late payment by multiple customers which  in the aggregate  are substantial would materially adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as of march   hearst owned approximately of the outstanding shares of ivillage common stock and had three representatives on the ivillage board of directors  therefore  hearst is able to significantly influence ivillage s corporate direction and policies 
as of march   hearst owned approximately of the outstanding shares of ivillage s common stock 
in addition  hearst holds a warrant entitling it to purchase  shares of ivillage s common stock 
pursuant to an amended and restated stockholder agreement entered into between hearst and ivillage on june   ivillage appointed three representatives of hearst to its board of directors  with one hearst designee appointed to each class of director 
the amended and restated stockholder agreement provides that the number of hearst representatives is subject to reduction if hearst s ownership of ivillage common stock falls below certain threshold levels 
there is also a hearst representative on each of ivillage s nominating and compensation committees 
hearst s board representation and stock ownership allows hearst to significantly influence ivillage s corporate direction and policies  including any mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  strategic relationships or sales of assets 
this board representation and stock ownership may also discourage or prevent transactions involving an actual or potential change of control  including transactions in which ivillage stockholders would otherwise receive a premium for their shares 
in addition  the interests of hearst  which owns or has significant investments in other businesses  including cable television networks  newspapers  magazines and electronic media  may from time to time be competitive with  or otherwise diverge from  ivillage s interests  particularly with respect to new business opportunities and future acquisitions 
although hearst is required to vote all shares that it holds in excess of subject to adjustment of ivillage s outstanding voting securities in accordance with the recommendation of ivillage s board of directors  hearst may effectively control certain stockholder actions  including approving changes to ivillage s certificate of incorporation or by laws and adopting or changing equity incentive plans 
hearst s effective control over stockholder actions may also determine the outcome of any merger  consolidation  sale of all or substantially all of ivillage s assets or other form of change of control that ivillage might consider 
ivillage s business will be harmed if internet usage does not continue to grow 
ivillage s market is new and rapidly evolving 
ivillage s business would be adversely affected if internet usage does not continue to grow  particularly usage by women 
a number of factors may inhibit internet usage  including o inadequate network infrastructure  o security concerns  o inconsistent quality of service  o market saturation  o lack of availability of cost effective  high speed service  o consumers returning to traditional or alternative sources for information  shopping and services  and o privacy concerns  including those related to the ability of web sites to gather information about users without their knowledge or consent and the increase in unrequested spamming e mail solicitations 
if internet usage continues to grow significantly  internet infrastructure may not be able to support the demands placed on it by this growth and its performance and reliability may decline 
in addition  internet service providers and web sites have experienced interruptions in their services as a result of the bankruptcies of internet service and infrastructure providers  outages  computer viruses and other delays occurring throughout the internet network infrastructure 
if these service interruptions frequently occur in the future  internet usage  including the usage of ivillage s web sites  could grow more slowly or decline 
the market for internet advertising is still developing 
if the internet fails to gain further acceptance as a medium for advertising  and ivillage fails to develop significant alternative sources of revenue  ivillage would have slower revenue growth than expected and would incur greater than expected losses 
ivillage expects to continue to derive a substantial portion of its revenues from sponsorships and advertising for the foreseeable future  as demand and market acceptance for internet advertising continues to develop 
accordingly  ivillage s business depends on market acceptance of the internet as a medium for advertising 
although ivillage derives a portion of its revenues from sales and or licensing of content  products and services  consumer reluctance to subscribe to or pay for such content  products and services may limit ivillage s ability to supplement internet advertising as a substantial source of revenue in the foreseeable future 
although there are currently several standards to measure the effectiveness of internet advertising  the industry has had difficulty convincing potential advertisers that internet advertising is a significant advertising medium 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have historically relied on traditional forms of advertising may be reluctant or slow to adopt online advertising 
in addition  advertisers and advertising agencies that use the internet as an advertising medium may find online advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services than traditional advertising media  including television  radio and print 
advertisers and advertising agencies that have invested substantial resources in traditional methods of advertising may also be reluctant to reallocate their resources to online advertising 
moreover  software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to an internet user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could adversely affect the commercial viability of internet advertising 
the market for online advertising also depends on the overall growth and acceptance of electronic commerce 
if the markets for online advertising and electronic commerce fail to develop or develop more slowly than ivillage expects  or if it is unable to adapt to new forms of internet advertising  ivillage would have slower than expected revenue growth and would incur greater than expected losses  and its business and financial condition would be harmed 
furthermore  different pricing models are used to sell advertising on the internet and it is difficult to predict which  if any  of the models will emerge as the industry standard 
for example  in recent years ivillage has experienced a shift from the larger  higher rate  long term sponsorship agreements that were prevalent a few years ago to smaller  lower rate  short term advertising agreements 
this makes it difficult to project ivillage s future advertising rates and revenues 
ivillage s business would be harmed by a decline in user traffic 
ivillage s business is inherently dependent upon high user traffic levels 
the rates charged to advertisers and sponsors and the number of products and services sold by ivillage are directly related to the number of visitors to ivillage s web sites 
user traffic from certain web sites that are non proprietary to ivillage are sometimes included in the reported information regarding ivillage s network of web sites 
these properties include certain of the hearst magazines and other parties who have agreed to have traffic from their web sites incorporated within the ivillage network 
there is no guarantee that the number of visitors to ivillage s web sites will not decline or that hearst or other third parties will continue to permit inclusion of their web sites as part of the ivillage network for traffic reporting purposes 
any decline in user traffic levels could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage may not be able to expand its business through acquisitions and joint ventures and  even if ivillage is successful in this regard  ivillage s operations may be adversely affected as a result of an acquisition or joint venture 
ivillage s business strategy includes growth through business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures 
ivillage s business could be harmed if it is unable to implement this business strategy 
ivillage s ability to implement this business strategy depends in large part on ivillage s ability to compete successfully with other entities for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners 
factors affecting ivillage s ability to compete successfully in this regard include o ivillage s financial condition relative to the financial condition of its competitors  and o the attractiveness of ivillage s common stock as potential consideration for entering into these types of transactions as compared to the common stock of other entities competing for these opportunities 
many of the entities with which ivillage competes for acquisition candidates and joint venture partners have greater financial resources than those of ivillage 
in addition  ivillage s acquisition program has been materially adversely affected by the substantial decline in the market price of ivillage s common stock over the last several years 
if  despite these factors  ivillage is successful in entering into additional business combinations  acquisitions and joint ventures  ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if ivillage is unable to integrate the operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures 
ivillage s ability to integrate the operations of the acquired companies or joint ventures will depend  in part  on ivillage s ability to overcome or address o the difficulties of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies and the potential disruption of ivillage s ongoing business as a result of these assimilation efforts  o the difficulties of establishing a new joint venture  including the need to attract and retain qualified personnel and the need to attract customers and advertisers  o the need to incorporate successfully the acquired or shared technology or content and rights into ivillage s products and media properties  o the difficulties of maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and o the potential impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management personnel or reduction of personnel 
in addition  effecting acquisitions could require use of a significant amount of ivillage s available cash 
furthermore  ivillage may have to issue equity or equity linked securities to pay for future acquisitions  and any of these issuances could be dilutive to existing and future stockholders 
acquisitions and investments may also have negative effects on ivillage s reported results of operations due to acquisition related charges  amortization of acquired technology and other intangibles  and or potential liabilities associated with the acquired businesses or joint ventures 
any of these acquisition related risks or costs could harm ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage may be unable to respond to the rapid technological change in its industry 
ivillage s market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
the growth of the internet and intense competition in ivillage s industry exacerbates these market characteristics 
to achieve its goals  ivillage needs to effectively integrate the various software programs and tools required to enhance and improve its product offerings and manage its business 
for example  ivillage s failure to promptly or adequately implement the world wide web consortium s platform for privacy preferences  or pp  standards could result in reduced user traffic to ivillage s web sites or regulatory and or legal claims if ivillage s pp policy does not conform to ivillage s written privacy policy posted on its web sites 
ivillage s future success will depend on its ability to adapt to rapidly changing technologies by continually improving the performance features and reliability of its services 
ivillage may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction or marketing of new products and services 
in addition  ivillage s new enhancements must meet the requirements of ivillage s current and prospective users and must achieve significant market acceptance 
ivillage also could incur substantial costs if it needs to modify its services or infrastructure to adapt to these changes 
due to expense reduction initiatives over the last several years  ivillage has not upgraded certain aspects of its technology infrastructure 
if ivillage fails to attract and retain key personnel  ivillage s business would be materially adversely affected 
ivillage s future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of ivillage s senior management and other key personnel  particularly douglas w 
mccormick  ivillage s chairman of the board and chief executive officer 
mr 
mccormick s current employment agreement expires in may and there can be no guarantee that ivillage and mr 
mccormick will be able to agree on a new employment arrangement past such date 
the loss of the services of mr 
mccormick would likely harm ivillage s business 
ivillage currently does not maintain key person life insurance for any of ivillage s senior management 
ivillage may be unable to retain its key employees or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
ivillage has from time to time experienced  and expects to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications as a result of its financial condition and relatively low common stock price 
as a result  ivillage has in the past and may in the future incur increased salaries and benefits 
if ivillage does not succeed in attracting new personnel or retaining and motivating its current personnel  ivillage s business will be materially adversely affected 
ivillage s uncertain sales cycles could adversely affect its business 
the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor is often lengthy  typically six weeks for smaller agreements and longer for larger agreements  and is subject to delays over which ivillage has little or no control  including o advertisers and sponsors budgetary constraints  o advertisers and sponsors internal acceptance reviews  o the success and continued internal support of advertisers and sponsors own development efforts  and o the possibility of cancellation or delay of projects by advertisers or sponsors 
during the sales cycle  ivillage may expend funds and management resources and yet not obtain sponsorship or advertising revenues 
accordingly  ivillage s results of operations for a particular period may be adversely affected if sales to advertisers or sponsors forecast in a particular period are delayed or do not otherwise occur 
ivillage relies on third parties to adequately measure the demographics of its user base and delivery of advertisements on ivillage s web sites 
ivillage s business would be harmed if these third parties fail to provide these services to ivillage 
it is important to ivillage s advertisers that ivillage accurately measure the demographics of its user base and the delivery of advertisements on ivillage s web sites 
ivillage depends on third parties to provide many of these measurement services  and do so accurately and reliably 
if these third parties are unable or unwilling to provide these services to ivillage in the future  ivillage would need to perform them or obtain them from another provider 
this could cause ivillage to incur additional costs or cause interruptions in its business until these services are replaced 
companies may choose not to advertise on ivillage s web sites or may pay less for advertising if they perceive ivillage s demographic measurements are not reliable 
either of these events could adversely affect ivillage s business 
ivillage may not be able to deliver various services if third parties fail to provide reliable software  systems and related services to ivillage 
ivillage depends on various third parties for software  systems and related services 
for example  ivillage relies on doubleclick inc s software for the placement of advertisements  ip applications for isp services and trellix corporation for personal home pages 
several of the third parties which provide software and services to ivillage have a limited operating history  have relatively immature technology and are themselves dependent on reliable delivery of services from others 
as a result  ivillage s ability to deliver various services to its users may be adversely affected by the failure of these third parties to provide reliable software  systems and related services to ivillage 
if ivillage is unable to deliver the services that its users expect  its business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
ivillage s principal investors investments in its competitors may result in conflicts of interest that could be adverse to ivillage 
ivillage s principal investors  such as hearst  rho capital partners  inc and aol time warner inc  may have conflicts of interests by virtue of investments in other companies that may compete with ivillage 
these investments may result in a conflict of interest for ivillage s principal investors or result in the diversion of attractive business opportunities from ivillage s principal investors to another company 
ivillage is unable to determine all of the competing investments held by these principal investors 
in addition  ivillage does not have the ability to constrain the investment activity of any of its principal investors and therefore cannot predict the extent of any future investments in businesses that are competitive with ivillage 
restrictions on ivillage s ability to enter into sponsorship  advertising or other business relationships with hearst s competitors may adversely affect ivillage s business 
ivillage s magazine content license and hosting agreement with hearst restricts ivillage s ability to enter into relationships with competitors of hearst and those restrictions may prevent ivillage from expanding its network and enhancing its content and the visibility of ivillage s brand  and may cause ivillage to forego potential advertising revenues from competitors of hearst 
specifically  the agreement provides that ivillage may not  without hearst s consent o enter into any agreement to include in ivillage s network any web sites for magazines that compete with hearst magazines  o display on the hearst magazine web sites any advertising or other promotional materials from magazines that compete with hearst magazines  or o display on an ivillage web page the brands  logos  trademarks or proprietary content of both hearst and a hearst competitor 
ivillage s business could be affected by future terrorist attacks or acts of war 
although none of the terrorist attacks in the united states in recent years have had a direct material adverse effect on ivillage s business  financial condition or results of operations  ivillage cannot assure you that future terrorist attacks in the united states  and particularly in new york city where ivillage s headquarters are located  acts of war involving the united states  or any response of the united states government to any future terrorist actions or acts of war  would not negatively affect ivillage through further disruption of the economy  financial markets or otherwise 
the proximity of ivillage s headquarters to certain possible targets in new york city could also  in the event of war or future terrorist attacks  result in damage to or destruction of ivillage s headquarters as well as the permanent or temporary loss of key personnel 
ivillage has not yet fully developed a disaster recovery plan and ivillage cannot guarantee that ivillage s insurance coverage would adequately reimburse ivillage for any damages suffered as a result of a terrorist attack or act of war 
there is intense competition among internet based businesses and publishing companies focused on women  and this competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share 
there are a large number of web sites competing for the attention and spending of members  users and advertisers 
ivillage s web sites compete for members  users and advertisers with the following types of companies o online services or web sites targeted at women  such as oxygen 
com and condenet 
com  o cable networks targeting women  such as oxygen media  inc  women s entertainment network and lifetime television  o web search and retrieval and other online service companies  commonly referred to as portals  such as aol  microsoft corporation s msn service and yahoo inc  o e commerce companies such as amazon 
com  inc  and o publishers and distributors of traditional media  such as television  radio and print 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
lamaze publishing s magazines directly compete with publishers of pre and post natal publications such as gruner and jahr  primedia and time inc these publishers have substantially greater marketing  research and financial resources than lamaze publishing 
increased competition may result in less advertising in lamaze publishing s magazines and a decline in lamaze publishing s advertising rates  which could adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage s business would be harmed if ivillage s systems fail or experience a slowdown 
substantially all of ivillage s communications hardware and some of its other computer hardware operations are located at exodus communications cable and wireless facilities in new jersey and verio s facilities in california 
fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events could damage these systems 
system failures may adversely affect ivillage s user traffic  which could adversely affect its revenues and operating results and harm its reputation with users  advertisers and commerce partners 
computer viruses  electronic break ins or other similar disruptive problems  such as those historically experienced by several leading web sites  could also adversely affect ivillage s web sites 
ivillage s insurance policies may not adequately compensate it for any losses that may occur due to any failures or interruptions in its systems 
ivillage does not presently have any secondary off site systems or a formal disaster recovery plan 
in addition  ivillage cannot assure you that exodus communications  which has filed for bankruptcy protection and has had certain of its assets subsequently purchased by cable and wireless  and verio  will be able to provide sufficient services for ivillage or that ivillage will be able to  if so desired  engage satisfactory alternative service providers 
ivillage s web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
ivillage s web sites have in the past experienced slower response times or decreased traffic for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences have not had a material effect on ivillage s business 
these types of occurrences in the future could cause users to perceive ivillage s web sites as not functioning properly and therefore cause them to use another web site or other methods to obtain information 
in addition  ivillage s users depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to ivillage s web sites 
many of them have experienced significant outages in the past  and could experience outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to ivillage s systems 
ivillage may incur liability for the information ivillage publishes or the products and services ivillage has sold 
ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if ivillage were to become liable for damage claims based on information published or products and services sold by it 
for example  ivillage has been in the past  and may be in the future  subject to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury or other legal theories relating to the information ivillage publishes on its web sites 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against providers of internet services in the past 
in addition  ivillage could be subjected to claims based upon the content that is accessible from ivillage s web sites through links to other web sites or through content and materials that may be posted by members in chat rooms or bulletin boards 
in addition  through ivillage 
com  women 
com and ivpn  ivillage distributes publications and broadcasts  over its web sites and the channels  information and advice regarding healthcare  childbirth  infant care and financial and tax issues 
ivillage may be exposed to liability claims in connection with this information 
consumers and or government regulators may also sue ivillage if any of the products or services that it sells are found to be defective  fail to perform properly or injure the user 
ivillage may also face potential liability in connection with the sale of products and services by its e commerce and other partners 
although ivillage s agreements with its partners typically contain provisions intended to limit ivillage s liability  these limitations may not prevent or protect against all possible claims 
ivillage s insurance  which covers commercial general liability  may not adequately protect ivillage against these claims 
liability claims could require ivillage to spend significant time and money in litigation and to pay significant damages 
as a result  liability claims  whether or not successful  could seriously damage ivillage s reputation and ivillage s business 
ivillage may also be forced to implement expensive measures to alter the way ivillage s services are provided to avoid potential liability 
possible infringement by third parties of ivillage s intellectual property rights  or claims of intellectual property infringement asserted against ivillage  could harm ivillage s business 
ivillage cannot be certain that the steps it has taken to protect its intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate ivillage s proprietary rights 
enforcing ivillage s intellectual property rights could entail significant expense and could prove difficult or impossible 
any infringement or misappropriation by third parties could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s future financial results 
furthermore  ivillage has invested resources in acquiring domain names for existing and potential future use 
ivillage cannot guarantee that ivillage will be entitled to use these domain names under applicable trademark and similar laws or that other desired domain names will be available 
although ivillage believes that its technologies do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  third parties have in the past asserted  and could assert in the future  claims of patent  trademark or copyright infringement or misappropriation of creative ideas or formats against ivillage with respect to ivillage s use of domain names  ivillage s content  the ivillagesolutions book series  web page formats  web business methods or any third party content it publishes or broadcasts 
ivillage expects that participants in ivillage s markets will continue to be subject to infringement claims 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention  require ivillage to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements or prevent ivillage from using important technologies  ideas or formats  any of which could materially harm ivillage s business  financial condition or results of operations 
ivillage may face potential liability for its privacy practices 
growing public concern about privacy and the collection  distribution and use of information about individuals may subject ivillage to increased regulatory scrutiny and or litigation 
if ivillage is accused of violating the stated terms of ivillage s privacy policy  ivillage may be forced to expend significant amounts of monetary and human resources to defend against these accusations 
ivillage also may be required to make changes to its present and planned products or services 
these consequences  together with any resulting liability for ivillage s privacy practices  could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage may be liable if third parties misappropriate ivillage s users personal information 
if third parties were able to penetrate ivillage s network security or otherwise misappropriate its users personal information or credit card information  ivillage could be subject to liability arising from claims related to  among other things  unauthorized purchases with credit card information  impersonation or other similar fraud claims or other misuse of personal information  such as for unauthorized marketing purposes 
in addition  the federal trade commission and state agencies have investigated various internet companies regarding their use of personal information 
ivillage could incur additional expenses if new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if ivillage s privacy practices are investigated 
consumer protection privacy regulations could impair ivillage s ability to obtain information about its users  which could result in decreased advertising revenues 
if ivillage becomes unable to collect personal data from a sufficient number of the users of its network  ivillage may lose significant advertising revenues 
ivillage generally asks its members and users to opt in to receive special offers and other direct marketing opportunities from ivillage  its advertisers and partners 
ivillage s network also requests and obtains personal data from users who register to become members of the network 
registration as a member is required in order for users to have full access to the services offered by ivillage s network 
personal data gathered from members is used to tailor content to them and is provided  on an aggregate basis  to advertisers to assist them in targeting their advertising campaigns to particular demographic groups 
the attractiveness of ivillage s network to current or prospective advertisers depends in part on ivillage s ability to provide user data to support this tailoring capability 
privacy concerns may cause users to resist providing this personal data  however 
the perception of security and privacy concerns  whether or not valid  may indirectly inhibit market acceptance of ivillage s use of personal data 
ivillage s failure to implement pp standards could discourage users from using ivillage s web sites  products and services and from providing their personal data to ivillage 
in addition  legislative or regulatory requirements may heighten these concerns if businesses must notify internet users that the data may be used by marketing entities to direct product promotion and advertising to the user 
other countries and political entities  such as the european economic community  have adopted legislation or regulations containing these notification and privacy requirements 
recently  several states have also proposed and or adopted privacy related legislation that prohibits unsolicited solicitations via e mail commonly known as spamming which contain significant monetary penalties for violations 
ivillage s network also uses cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a cookie is information keyed to a specific server  file pathway or directory location that is stored on a user s hard drive  possibly without the user s knowledge  but is generally removable by the user 
information gathered from cookies is used by ivillage to tailor content to users of ivillage s network and may also be provided to advertisers on an aggregate basis 
in addition  advertisers may themselves use cookies to track user behavior and preferences 
a number of internet commentators  advocates and governmental bodies in the united states and other countries have urged the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
if these laws are passed  it may become more difficult for ivillage to tailor content to its users  making ivillage s network less attractive to users 
similarly  the unavailability of cookies may restrict the use of tailored advertising  making ivillage s network less attractive to advertisers and causing ivillage to lose significant advertising revenues 
government regulation and legal uncertainties could add additional costs to doing business on the internet 
there are currently few laws or regulations that specifically regulate communications or commerce on the internet 
laws and regulations may be adopted in the future  however  that address issues such as user privacy  pricing and taxation  content  copyrights  distribution  antitrust matters and the characteristics and quality of products and services 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as property ownership  obscenity  libel and personal privacy are applicable to the internet or whether laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to ivillage s business will become applicable 
any new laws or regulations relating to the internet could adversely affect ivillage s business 
due to the global nature of the internet  it is possible that  although ivillage s transmissions over the internet originate primarily in new york  the governments of other states and foreign countries might attempt to regulate ivillage s business activities 
in addition  because ivillage s service is available over the internet in multiple states and foreign countries  these jurisdictions may require ivillage to qualify to do business as a foreign corporation in each of these states or foreign countries  which could subject ivillage to taxes and other regulations 
ivillage is subject to legal proceedings that could result in liability and damage to its business 
from time to time  ivillage has been  and expects to continue to be  subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of its business  as well as two securities class action lawsuits 
ivillage is unable to determine the amount for which it potentially could be liable since a number of these lawsuits do not specify an amount for damages sought  and ivillage maintains insurance  or believes it is entitled to indemnification from third parties  which may cover some or all of the claims  should they be successful 
such proceedings and claims  even if not meritorious  could require the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could harm ivillage s business 
ivillage believes it has meritorious defenses to all the claims currently made against ivillage 
litigation  however  is inherently uncertain and ivillage may not prevail in these suits 
ivillage cannot predict whether future claims will be made or the ultimate resolution of any existing or future claim 
ivillage s operation of ivpn poses a number of risks that could materially adversely affect ivillage s business strategy 
there are a number of risks in operating ivpn related to lamaze publishing  baby steps magazine and the channels  which are all primarily non internet businesses  including o the competitiveness of the media  television and publishing industries  o ivillage s limited experience in operating a multi media publishing and television company  o ivillage s ability to identify and predict trends in a timely manner that may impact consumer tastes in baby related information in lamaze publishing s and ivip s publications  on the newborn channel and the newborn channel spanish  and health related information on the wellness channel  o ivillage s ability to continue to sell advertising and sponsorships on its web sites and ivpn s magazines  videos and the channels  o ivillage s ability to continue to commercialize and protect the lamaze mark  and o ivillage s ability to maintain and market the lamaze 
com web site 
ivillage s inability to perform the functions required for the operation of ivpn in an efficient and timely manner could result in a disruption of operations of ivpn that could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s business strategy 
ivillage s business would be harmed if transmission of the channels were interrupted 
the channels are broadcast to participating hospitals via either a satellite television network broadcast or an in hospital digital delivery system 
there is a risk that the satellite or the in hospital delivery system from which the transmissions are sent may malfunction  interrupting broadcasts of the channels 
furthermore  extreme adverse weather conditions or third parties could damage or disable receivers and transmitters on the ground hindering transmission of the channels signal 
in the event this occurs  there may be a period of time before transmission of all or some of the channels could resume 
any interruption in ivillage s ability to transmit the channels could have an adverse effect on its business 
ivillage s operation of the ivillageaccess isp poses a number of risks that could materially adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are a number of risks involved in the operation of the ivillageaccess isp  including o the competitiveness of the isp industry  o ivillage s limited experience in operating an isp  o ivillage s ability to identify and predict trends in a timely manner that may impact consumers tastes for subscription to an isp  o patterns of subscriber acquisition and retention  and seasonal trends relating to subscriber usage of ivillageaccess  o the competence of the third parties that ivillage relies on for technical and customer service support and the overall operation of ivillageaccess  o the effectiveness of ivillage s revenue sharing arrangements and other strategic alliances in connection with the operation of ivillageaccess  o changes in operating expenses due to marketing and other subscriber acquisition costs  and or telecommunications expenses  o changes in government regulation of isps could negatively impact ivillage by decreasing revenues and increasing costs  and o ivillage s ability to protect its systems from any telecommunications failures  security breaches  power loss  or software related system failures 
ivillageaccess may not be able to compete with other companies offering faster  more advanced  internet connection technologies 
currently  ivillageaccess only provides for a dial up connection to the internet 
due to the increased speeds of alternative internet services connections  such as broadband services like dsl and cable technologies  the demand for such alternatives has rapidly increased 
ivillage cannot provide any assurances as to the demand for dial up internet connections in the future 
although ivillage is considering whether to provide broadband services  it cannot guarantee that in the event it chose to do so that ivillage i would have adequate access to such technologies at favorable rates  ii would be able to partner with providers of broadband services  or iii would have adequate capital to take advantage of any existing or future opportunities to provide broadband services 
ivillage competes in the market for internet connections with many isp companies that possess significant financial resources  have well established brand names  and large existing customer bases 
in many markets  these isp companies already offer  or are expected to offer  broadband internet access 
ivillage s inability to compete with other dial up internet service providers  those isp companies offering broadband services  or other competitors offering advanced internet connection technologies  could have a material adverse effect on ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
ivillage s sale of ivillagesolutions products  its line of vitamins  minerals  and supplements  poses a number of risks that could materially adversely affect ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations 
there are a number of risks involved in the sale of the supplement line  including o the competitiveness of the vitamin  mineral and supplement industry  o ivillage s limited experience in operating as a retailer of vitamins  minerals and supplements  o ivillage s ability to identify and predict trends in a timely manner that may impact consumers tastes for vitamins  minerals and supplements  o ivillage s ability to effectively market to and attract customers of competitors such as mass merchandisers  drug store chains  independent drug stores  supermarkets and health food stores  o the competence of the third parties that ivillage relies on for the development  manufacture and distribution of the ivillagesolutions products  o the reluctance of consumers to purchase vitamins  minerals and supplements online  o the effectiveness of ivillage s revenue sharing arrangements and other strategic alliances in connection with the sale of ivillagesolutions products  o changes in operating expenses due to customer acquisition costs including manufacturing  marketing and distribution expenses  and o changes in government regulation of vitamins  minerals and supplements could negatively impact ivillage by decreasing revenues and increasing costs 
ivillage may face potential products liability based upon its ivillagesolutions products 
as with other retailers  distributors and manufacturers of products that are ingested  ivillage faces an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of its products results in injury or death 
ivillage may be subjected to various product liability claims  including  among others  that its products contain contaminants or include inadequate instructions as to use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
ivillage carries insurance in the types and amounts that management considers reasonably adequate to cover the risks associated with the operations of this business 
there can be no assurance  however  that such insurance will continue to be available at a reasonable cost or  if available  will be adequate to cover liabilities 
government regulation could add additional costs to doing business in the vitamin  mineral and supplement industry 
the manufacturing  processing  formulating  packaging  labeling and advertising of the ivillagesolutions products are subject to regulation by federal agencies  including the federal drug administration  the federal trade commission  the united states department of agriculture and the environmental protection agency 
these activities may also be regulated by various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries to which ivillagesolutions products may be distributed 
ivillage cannot i guarantee that existing laws and regulations have been properly interpreted and applied to the ivillagesolutions products  ii predict the nature of any future laws  regulations  interpretations or applications  or iii determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative orders  when and if promulgated  would have on the manufacture  sale and distribution of ivillagesolutions products 
such changes may require the reformulation of certain products to meet new standards  the recall or discontinuance of certain products not capable of reformulation  expanded documentation of the properties of certain products  expanded or different labeling  or scientific substantiation 
any or all of such requirements could ultimately have a material adverse effect upon ivillage s business  financial condition and results of operations
