overview merger with the timber company 
on october   the six entities that comprised the timber company  formerly a separate operating group of georgia pacific corporation georgia pacific  merged with and into plum creek  with plum creek as the surviving company 
as a part of the merger  the shareholders of georgia pacific corporation timber group common stock timber company stock received shares of plum creek s common stock for each share of timber company stock  or approximately million shares 
the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  with the timber company treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
as a result  the historical financial statements of the timber company became the financial statements of plum creek effective as of the date of the merger 
consequently  our financial statements for reflect a full year of combined operations of the merged companies whereas the statement of income for the year ended december  reflects the performance of the timber company until the date of the merger  and that of the merged companies for the remainder of the statement of income for the year ended december  reflects only the operating results of the timber company 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
prior to the timber company merger  the timber company had only one reportable segment 
following the merger  the combined companies report the results of five business segments 
the timber company s historical segment information has been restated back to the beginning of to reflect these new segments

table of contents are based on these new segments and reflect the operating results of the timber company through the merger date october   and the results of the combined company subsequent to the merger date 
see note of the notes to financial statements for segment and geographical area information 
additionally  in connection with the merger plum creek replaced approximately million of georgia pacific debt attributed to the timber company with third party debt  consisting of million of fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
plum creek also assumed approximately million outstanding stock options after adjusting for the exchange ratio with respect to timber company stock at exercise prices ranging from to after adjusting for the exchange ratio 
see notes  and of the notes to financial statements 
plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the united states internal revenue code 
as a consequence of the timber company merger  a tax benefit of approximately million was recorded to reflect the elimination of a deferred tax liability associated with temporary differences related primarily to timberlands that are not expected to be disposed of in a transaction subject to built in gains tax during a ten year period 
additionally  plum creek inherited the accumulated earnings and profits of the timber company and  because of certain reit requirements  was required to distribute these earnings and profits prior to january  as a result  our fourth quarter dividend of per share was accelerated and paid on december  the dividend normally would have been paid in february see note of the notes to financial statements 
other merger related items 
during  we had the following other merger related items which had an impact on our results of operations income tax benefit 
as a result of the entities comprising the timber company  each a taxable corporation  merging into plum creek  a reit  which is generally not subject to federal or state income tax  a tax benefit of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of the benefit relates primarily to the elimination of the deferred tax liability associated with temporary differences related primarily to timberlands that are not expected to be disposed of in a transaction subject to built in gains tax during the ten year period following the merger

severance 
in connection with the timber company merger  the employment of several executives and key employees of the timber company terminated 
terminated employees were paid a severance and two terminated executives of the timber company were awarded additional pension benefits 
an expense of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of for these severance and pension benefits 
accounting method changes 
in  the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

see notes and of the notes to financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  the company changed its accounting policy to capitalize certain timber reforestation costs that were previously expensed 
the cumulative effect of this policy change is not reflected in the beginning balance of timber and timberlands because information is not available to compute the cumulative effect of the change over the prior harvest cycle of approximately years

see note of the notes to financial statements  timber and timberlands 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
prior to the timber company merger  the timber company recognized revenue from timber sales under three different methods  depending upon the terms of the sale 
the methods were delivered log sales  pay as cut contracts and timber deeds under a delivered log sale agreement  the seller cuts the tree and delivers it to the buyer 
risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer when the log is delivered 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered to the customer 
with delivered log sales  the seller incurs the cost of logging and hauling 
for the last few days of an accounting period  there are typically delivered logs for which we have not received documentation and we have not created an invoice 
in that case  an accrual for these deliveries is made along with an accrual for the costs of logging and hauling 
pay as cut contacts are agreements pursuant to which the buyer agrees to harvest all of the trees on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each of the different types of trees over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases an advance is received in connection with pay as cut contracts  and in other cases the buyer agrees to cut only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer as the trees are cut 
the buyer furnishes us with supporting information for the amount of wood that has been removed along with their payment 
revenue is recognized when the trees are cut 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut contract is a function of the total volume of wood actually removed multiplied by the agreed upon per unit price for each of the various types of trees on a tract of land 
there is typically a lag between the time the tree is harvested and the time the buyer pays for the tree 
at the end of each accounting period  we typically make an accrual for the trees that have been cut but for which we have not received payment 
timber deeds are agreements pursuant to which the buyer agrees to harvest all of the trees on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually to months 
however  unlike a pay as cut contract  risk of loss and title to the trees transfer to the buyer when the contract is signed 
the buyer also pays the full purchase price when the contract is signed 
under a timber deed  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue from a timber deed sale is recognized when the contract is signed 
timber deeds are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc total revenue recognized under a timber deed is the amount of the highest bid and is not dependent upon the volume or types of trees actually harvested 
subsequent to the timber company merger  to comply with certain reit requirements we replaced timber deed agreements with lump sum sale agreements 
under a lump sum sale  the parties agree to a lump sum price for all the timber available for harvest on a tract of land 
generally the lump sum price is paid when the contract is signed 
however  unlike timber deeds  title to the timber and risk of loss transfers to the buyer as the timber is cut 
therefore  revenue is recognized each month based on the amount of timber actually harvested  compared to total pg 
pcl 
table of contents timber available to be harvested on a tract of land over the term of the contract usually to months 
under a lump sum sale  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
lump sum sales are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on timber cruise information 
total revenue recognized under a lump sum sale contract is the amount of the highest bid  and is not dependent upon the volume or type of trees actually harvested 
since revenue is recognized under a lump sum sale agreement as the trees are cut  an estimate of how much revenue to recognize each month is made based on how much volume has been removed compared to the total volume available for harvest on a tract of land according to the timber cruise 
we generally receive weekly information from the buyer regarding how much volume has been removed 
additionally  we gather information by observing the tract to estimate the percentage of original timber harvested 
inevitably  the total volume harvested from a tract of land will be different than the volume estimated in the timber cruise 
if the total volume removed is greater than the cruise estimated volume  we will stop recognizing revenue once the total revenue recognized is equal to total lump sum contract price 
no revenue will be recognized for volumes harvested in excess of the cruise estimated volume 
if the total volume removed is less than the cruise estimated volume  an adjustment will be recorded in the month in which we learn of the difference 
the adjustment is an increase in revenue equal to the difference between the total revenue recognized to date and the total lump sum contract price 
finally  for our larger lump sum contracts which cover multiple tracts  we adjust revenues at the end of each accounting period for any known trends which have materialized in the tracts that have been completely harvested 
while the timing of revenue recognition under a timber deed and a lump sum contract is materially different  this change is not expected to have a material impact on the year to year comparison of our results of operations 
the amount of delivered log sales to external customers during was million 
the amount of pay as cut sales during was million and the amount of revenue recognized under lump sum sale contracts during was million 
at december  accrued revenues for delivered and pay as cut log sales was million and deferred revenues for lump sum contracts was million 
management attempts to estimate accrued revenues at the end of each accounting period based on the best information available 
management does not believe that there is a material difference between estimated accrued revenues and actual revenues 
substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  a substantial portion of our timber sales consists of either pay as cut contracts or lump sum sales 
under both pay as cut contracts and lump sum sales  the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs 
therefore  operating profit percentages are significantly higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales 
as a major landowner  we estimate that approximately  acres of the company s approximately million acres of timberlands are located in recreational areas or near expanding population centers and may be better suited for conservation  residential or recreational purposes  rather than for long term commercial timberland management 
furthermore  the company estimates that an additional  acres may also be suited for conservation  residential or recreational development 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
furthermore  from time to time we dispose of large non strategic timberland holdings  which may result in material gains and losses from real estate sales 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
historically  our real estate segment has reported significant operating profit percentages ranging from to of revenues  and this trend is expected to continue in the future 
the high operating profit percentages are primarily because a significant portion of our timberlands was acquired many years ago 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the annual appreciation in our timberlands cannot be reflected in our earnings until the year in which we sell the properties 
furthermore  in connection with major timberland acquisitions we are generally not able to identify our future real estate sales 
this was the case in our merger with the timber company 
since the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  the timberlands of plum creek were recorded at their fair value 
however  while our purchase pcl pg 

table of contents price allocation and related appraisals reflected greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future for uses which have a higher value than timber production  we were generally not able to identify specific properties 
therefore  within each region  we allocated this higher value proportionately among all the acres acquired  except for certain specifically identified properties 
in general  however  specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
management believes that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions  and it does not believe that it has the ability  with any level of precision  to estimate which of our properties will someday sell for more than their underlying timber production value 
depletion 
depletion expense for was million 
depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each region are adjusted annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south and as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
for the northern resources segment depletion expense in was million 
the average depletion rate for the northern resources segment was per ton during the amount of estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  for the northern resources segment included in the calculation of the depletion rate was million 
the estimated future volume for the northern resources segment included in the calculation of the depletion rate was million tons 
if the estimated future silviculture costs were increased by  or million  and assuming future timber volumes do not change  then the depletion expense for the northern resources segment would have increased by million 
if the estimate of future volume for the northern resources segment was decreased by  or million tons  and assuming future silviculture costs do not change  then the depletion expense for the northern resources segment would have increased by million 
for the southern resources segment depletion expense in was million 
the average depletion rate for the southern resources segment was per ton during the amount of estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  for the southern resources segment included in the calculation of the depletion rate was million 
the estimated future volume for the southern resources segment included in the calculation of the depletion rate was million tons 
if the estimated future silviculture costs were increased by or million and assuming future timber volumes do not change  then the depletion expense for the southern resources segment would have increased by million 
if the estimate of future volume for the southern resources segment was decreased by  or million tons  and assuming future silviculture costs do not change  then the depletion expense for the southern resources segment would have increased by million 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in weather patterns  inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
the company has invested in technology that enables it to predict its current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and pg 
pcl 
table of contents fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised annually  management does not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
deferred income taxes 
plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections of the united states internal revenue code commencing july  a reit is generally not subject to corporate level tax if it satisfies certain requirements 
on october   the timber company  consisting of a group of corporate entities  merged with and into plum creek 
as a consequence of the merger of a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  the deferred tax liabilities of the timber company were eliminated except for any expected transactions that would be subject to built in gains tax 
plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level tax built in gains tax only if it makes a taxable disposition of certain property acquired in the timber company merger within the ten year period following the merger date 
the built in gains tax only applies to gains from such asset sales to the extent the fair value of the property exceeds its tax basis at the merger date 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  the company recorded a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of the timber company merger 
the benefit of million represents the elimination of the deferred tax liability associated with temporary differences related primarily to timberlands that are not expected to be disposed of in a transaction subject to built in gains tax during a ten year period following the merger 
management estimates that approximately of the timber company s timberlands will be sold in one or more taxable transactions over the ten year period ending october  as a result  million of deferred taxes related to timberlands were not eliminated during the fourth quarter of timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax during reduced our deferred tax liability by  this amount was lower than originally estimated because a significant portion of the proceeds from our timberland sales that would otherwise be subject to the built in gains tax were reinvested in like kind property 
the built in gains tax can generally be avoided to the extent proceeds are reinvested in like kind property within the statutory time period 
it is not possible to predict whether we will be able to identify suitable replacement properties in the future in order to avoid the built in gains tax 
it is likely that actual timberland sales over the ten year built in gain period will be greater than  or less than  
an adjustment to earnings will be required in the period in which it is determined that timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax will be greater than  or less than  
long term incentive plans 
plum creek has a stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock  dividend equivalents and value management awards 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
during the company recognized million of compensation expense associated with its long term incentive plans  of which million related to value management awards 
value management awards  which are granted every other year  provide incentive compensation to participants that is contingent upon the company s performance measured against the performance of a peer group of forest products companies over a three year period 
value management awards are earned in whole or in part based on a sliding scale 
no value management award is earned if the company s total stockholder return is below the th percentile of the peer group 
the full value management award is earned if the company s total stockholder return is above the th percentile 
plum creek recognizes compensation expense for value management awards based on the expected value of the award upon vesting and accrues the related expense over the vesting period 
the actual expense cannot be determined until the end of the three year performance period 
furthermore  since the amount of the award  if any  is based on plum creek s relative performance compared to that of its peer group  it is possible to have significant changes to the estimated award value during the performance period 
compensation expense related to the value management awards is adjusted in the quarter in which there has been a material change in the expected vested value of the awards 
therefore  it is possible that an adjustment to the value management award expense may be material to the result of operations for the quarter and the year in which the estimated vested benefit is revised 
the performance period for the grants ended on december  in which the full value for the awards was achieved 
a total expense of million was recorded over the vesting period in connection with the pcl pg

pensions 
plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
participants benefits vest after five years of service 
subsequent to the timber company merger  the cash balance of benefits of salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
furthermore  employees employed by the company on september  earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance formula or the amount of a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits of hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to the plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year and management intends to fund annually such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation abo  the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plans were discontinued 
the plan invests in common stock  bonds and cash equivalents 
the portfolio of investments during consisted of approximately equities and bonds 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  fair value of plan assets  pension cost and accrued pension liability under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make certain assumptions primarily involving the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  weighted average discount rate and rate of increase of future compensation levels 
the expected return on plan assets for the year ended december  is based on the calculated value of plan assets and an annual rate of return that is based on the composition of the pension plan assets 
the assumed discount rate of is based on moody s long term aa corporate bond yield which is considered to represent the rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that  if invested at the measurement date  would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefits when due 
finally  the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels of represents management s long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
for the year ended december   the company recognized million of expense related to the pension plans and made cash contributions of million 
as of december   plum creek had fully funded the abo and our balance sheet reflects an accrued net pension liability of million 
it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation reflected in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets 
if the company had used a long term rate of return on plan assets of instead of the that was used in computing our pension expense  pension expense for would have increased by million 
similarly  if the company had used a weighted average discount rate of instead of the that was used in computing our pension expense  pension expense for would have increased by million 
additionally  if the company had used a rate of increase in compensation levels of instead of the that was used in computing our pension expense  pension expense for would have increased by million

hardwood sawtimber markets improved slightly due to a tight supply of quality sawlogs

table of contents manufactured products segment 
composite indices for commodity lumber in were down from levels  due primarily to persistent excess lumber production in north america 
despite a increase in housing starts from and the highest level of housing starts in sixteen years  strong production in the us and canada and reduced exports from the us created an excess supply of lumber 
north american lumber capacity continued to substantially exceed lumber demand due to the increased capacity installed by many producers during the prior decade 
duties were implemented on shipments of canadian lumber to the us in may to date  the duty has had the unanticipated impact of lowering lumber prices in part because large canadian lumber producers have increased production in order to lower their per unit manufacturing costs 
prices for our plywood in remained similar to prices for plywood remained weak due to continued competition from lower cost osb  which constrained plywood prices and displaced commodity plywood used in housing applications 
prices for our medium density fiberboard mdf remained weak during due to the continued worldwide mdf overcapacity and the strong us dollar  which allowed foreign producers to significantly increase their penetration in the us market 
harvest plans we determine our annual roundwood sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a continuous block of trees of a similar age  species mix and silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to  acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  a forest s progression from an unmanaged to a managed forest  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
active forest management involves the conversion of a forest from an unmanaged to a managed state 
an unmanaged forest is made up largely of mature and over mature stands of timber which are growing slowly  both in terms of volume and value 
in a managed forest  there exists a range of age classes  from recently planted stands to economically mature stands 
the conversion of a forest from an unmanaged to a managed state can take from one to two forest generations  or rotations 
toward the end of the initial conversion process  a decline in the inventory volume is normal as the harvest of mature and over mature stands ends  and as the younger  faster growing stands have yet to reach final harvest age 
harvest levels in the northern resources segment were million tons during and million tons during  a increase  due to the timber company merger 
had the merger between plum creek and the timber company occurred prior to  estimated harvest levels in the northern resources segment for would have approximated million tons 
harvest levels in are expected to increase 
this increase is due primarily to additional harvest in wisconsin because of the acquisition of  acres in december and additional harvest in oregon as young stands continue to reach maturity 
harvest levels in the southern resources segment were million tons during and million tons during  a increase  due to the timber company merger 
had the merger between plum creek and the timber company occurred prior to  estimated harvest levels in the southern resources segment for would have approximated million tons 
harvest levels in are expected to decrease due primarily to lower hardwood pulpwood harvests 
in and  the company took advantage of favorable ground conditions and markets to accelerate harvests in areas with concentration of hardwood pulpwood 
actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors that may be outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs

table of contents us canada softwood lumber agreement 
the trade dispute between the united states and canada continues to be a major source of uncertainty for us lumber markets 
on march   the five year lumber trade agreement between the us and canada expired 
the agreement was intended to limit the volume of lumber that was exported to the us through the assessment of a tariff on annual lumber exports in excess of certain levels from the four major lumber producing canadian provinces 
prior to this trade agreement  canadian lumber producers were aggressively increasing their penetration into the us market 
soon after the agreement expired  us industry coalitions submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
on march   the department of commerce rendered its final determination in favor of the us industry coalitions and set a countervailing duty on canadian lumber imports and an anti dumping duty on all non investigated canadian exporters averaging representing the weighted average of the anti dumping rates imposed on the investigated canadian exporters 
the department of commerce decreased these duties on april  to and  respectively 
following a final determination by the international trade commission on may  that canadian lumber imports threaten the us industry with material injury  the department of commerce put into effect the countervailing and anti dumping duties on may  however  reports indicate that the final duties have not had the effect of decreasing canadian lumber imports into the us the future of the us imposed import duties on canadian lumber remains uncertain 
the final import duties imposed by the department of commerce have been referred to appeals panels operating under the world trade organization and the north american free trade agreement 
these appeals could ultimately be determined adversely to us interests  which could result in an increase of canadian lumber imports into us markets 
moreover  notwithstanding any favorable us rulings  canadian lumber imports could otherwise increase or remain at current levels 
currently  the us and canadian governments are attempting to negotiate an agreement to settle the lumber dispute 
however  there can be no assurance that an agreement will ever be reached  or that the terms of any such agreement would be favorable to the interests of the us lumber industry

we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue both the acquisition and divestiture of timberlands to increase the value of our assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased  acres of timberlands located primarily in wisconsin  and on october   we completed our merger with the timber company 
as a result of these acquisitions  our ownership increased to approximately million acres at december  and million acres at december  from approximately million acres at december  we may sell timberlands and facilities  from time to time  if attractive opportunities arise 
accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of acquisitions and divestitures

plum creek paid the dividend for the fourth quarter of on december  normally  the fourth quarter dividend for would have been paid in february the payment of the fourth quarter dividend was accelerated because of our merger with the timber company and the reit requirement under the internal revenue code that all earnings and profits inherited in connection with a merger must be distributed by january st of the year following the merger

risk factors risk factors applicable to the business of plum creek the cyclical nature of the forest products industry could adversely affect our results of operations our results of operations are affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products industry 
prices and demand for logs and manufactured wood products are subject to cyclical fluctuations 
the demand for logs and wood products is primarily affected by the level of new residential construction activity and  to a lesser extent  repair and remodeling activity and other industrial uses 
the demand for logs is also affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper markets 
these activities are  in turn  subject to fluctuations due to  among other factors changes in domestic and international economic conditions  interest rates  population growth and changing demographics  and seasonal weather cycles eg  dry summers  wet winters 
decreases in the level of residential construction activity generally reduce demand for logs and wood products 
this results in lower revenues  profits and cash flows 
industry wide increases in the supply of logs and wood products during favorable price environments can also lead to downward pressure on prices 
timber companies generally increase production volumes for logs and wood products during favorable price environments 
however  such increased production  when coupled with even modest declines in demand for these products in general  could lead to oversupply and lower prices 
our results of operations may also be subject to global economic changes as global supplies of wood fiber shift in response to changing economic conditions 
changes in global economic conditions that could affect our results of operations include  but are not limited to  new timber supply sources and changes in currency exchange rates  foreign and domestic interest rates and foreign and domestic trade policies 
in addition  the market for and ability to sell non strategic timberlands and timberland properties that have higher and better uses can have a significant effect on our results of operations 
market demand for timberlands generally and higher and better use timberlands may decrease and adversely affect our results of operations 
the forest products industry is highly competitive the forest products industry is highly competitive in terms of price and quality 
wood products are subject to increasing competition from a variety of substitute products  including non wood and engineered wood products 
for example  plywood markets are subject to competition from oriented strand board  and us lumber and log markets are subject to competition from other worldwide suppliers 
historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
in  the us and canadian governments entered into a five year lumber trade agreement that became effective april  the trade agreement was intended to limit the volume of canadian lumber exported into the us from the four major producing canadian provinces through the assessment of an export tariff on annual lumber exports to the us in excess of certain levels 
the trade agreement expired in late march  and soon thereafter us industry coalitions submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce 
on march   the department of commerce rendered its final determination in favor of the us industry coalitions and set a countervailing duty on canadian lumber imports and an anti dumping duty on all non investigated canadian exporters averaging representing the weighted average of the anti dumping rates imposed on the investigated canadian exporters 
the department of commerce decreased these pg 
pcl 
table of contents duties on april  to and  respectively 
following a final determination by the international trade commission on may  that canadian lumber imports threaten the us industry with material injury  the department of commerce put into effect the countervailing and anti dumping duties on may  however  reports indicate that the final duties have not had the effect of decreasing canadian lumber imports into the us the future of the us imposed import duties on canadian lumber remains uncertain 
the final import duties imposed by the department of commerce have been referred to appeals panels operating under the world trade organization and the north american free trade agreement 
these appeals could ultimately be determined adversely to us interests  which could result in an increase of canadian lumber imports into us markets 
moreover  notwithstanding any favorable us rulings  canadian lumber imports could otherwise increase or remain at current levels 
currently  the us and canadian governments are attempting to negotiate an agreement to settle the lumber dispute 
however  there can be no assurance that an agreement will ever be reached  or that the terms of any such agreement would be favorable to the interests of the us lumber industry 
therefore  other factors remaining unchanged  downward pressure on domestic lumber and log prices caused by canadian imports could continue or increase 
our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate on july   we converted from a master limited partnership to a real estate investment trust  or reit 
reits are required to distribute of their net taxable ordinary income 
however  unlike ordinary income such as rent  the internal revenue code of  as amended  does not require reits to distribute capital gain income 
accordingly  we do not believe that the internal revenue code will require us to distribute any material amounts of cash given that the majority of our income comes from timber sales  which are treated as capital gains 
our board of directors  in its sole discretion  determines the amount of the quarterly dividends to be provided to our stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors including  but not limited to  our results of operations  cash flow and capital requirements  economic conditions  tax considerations  borrowing capacity and other factors  including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments  future acquisitions and divestitures  harvest levels  changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands and those timberland properties that have higher and better uses 
consequently  our dividend levels may fluctuate 
we were required by january   to distribute the earnings and profits acquired from the six entities that comprised the timber company 
we believe that the accelerated payment of our fourth quarter dividend for  which we paid on december   was sufficient to distribute these earnings and profits 
if we failed to distribute an amount equal to these earnings and profits  we might be subject to adverse tax consequences 
we expect that  even if the earnings and profits were subsequently adjusted upward by the internal revenue service  the amount we distributed exceeds such earnings and profits 
nevertheless  such an adjustment may give rise to the imposition of the excise tax on the excess income required to be distributed over the amounts treated as distributed after application of the earnings and profits rule 
our ability to harvest timber may be subject to limitations which could adversely affect our operations weather conditions  timber growth cycles  access limitations and regulatory requirements associated with the protection of wildlife and water resources may restrict harvesting of timberlands as may other factors  including damage by fire  insect infestation  disease  prolonged drought and other natural disasters 
although damage from such natural causes usually is localized and affects only a limited percentage of the timber  there can be no assurance that any damage affecting our timberlands will in fact be so limited 
as is common in the forest products industry  we do not maintain insurance coverage with respect to damage to our timberlands 
much of our northwest timberlands are intermingled with sections of federal land managed by the united states forest service 
in many cases  access is only  or most economically  achieved through a road or roads built across adjacent federal land 
in order to access these intermingled timberlands  we have obtained from time to time either pcl pg 

table of contents temporary or permanent access rights across federal lands 
this process has often been  and will likely continue to be  affected by  among other things  the requirements of the endangered species act  the national environmental policy act and the clean water act 
access and regulatory restrictions may delay or prevent us from harvesting some of our timberlands 
our revenues  net income and cash flow from our operations are dependent to a significant extent on the pricing of our products and our continued ability to harvest timber at adequate levels 
in addition  the terms of our long term debt agreements and lines of credit limit our ability to fund dividends to stockholders by accelerating the harvest of significant amounts of timber 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may prevent a change in control some provisions of our certificate of incorporation may discourage a third party from seeking to gain control of us 
for example  the ownership limitations described in our certificate of incorporation could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or limiting a change of control in which holders of our common stock might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price 
the following is a summary of provisions of our certificate of incorporation that may have this effect 
the ownership limit 
in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit  not more than of the value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals  as defined in the internal revenue code 
for the purpose of preserving our reit qualification  our certificate of incorporation prohibits ownership  either directly or under the applicable attribution rules of the internal revenue code  of more than of the lesser of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding or the value of the outstanding shares of our common stock by any stockholder other than by some designated persons agreed to by us or as set forth in our certificate of incorporation the ownership limit 
the ownership limit may have the effect of discouraging an acquisition of control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
the ownership limit in our certificate of incorporation also restricts the transfer of our common stock 
for example  any transfer of our equity is null and void if the transfer would result in any person owning  directly or indirectly  equity in excess of the ownership limit  result in our equity being owned  directly or indirectly  by fewer than persons  result in us being closely held as defined in the internal revenue code  result in us failing to qualify as a domestically controlled reit as defined in the internal revenue code  or otherwise cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
the preferred stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to million shares of preferred stock 
upon issuance  our board of directors will establish the preferences and rights for this preferred stock 
these preferences and rights may include the right to elect additional directors 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if a change in control were in our stockholders best interests 
section of the delaware general corporation law 
section of the delaware general corporation law generally prohibits us from engaging in business transactions with a person or entity that owns or more of our voting stock for a period of three years following the time such person or entity became an interested stockholder unless  prior to such time  our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in such person or entity becoming an interested stockholder

if we fail to qualify as a reit  we might need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the additional tax liability 
accordingly  funds available for investment or dividends to our stockholders would be reduced for each of the years involved 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the internal revenue code to our operations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control

although we operate in a manner consistent with the reit qualification rules  there cannot be any assurance that we are or will remain so qualified

laws and regulations protecting the environment have generally become more stringent in recent years and could become more stringent in the future 
some environmental statutes impose strict liability  rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to the person s negligence or fault 
these laws or future legislation or administrative or judicial action with respect to protection of the environment may adversely affect our business 
the endangered species act and similar state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction 
a number of species on our timberlands have been and in the future may be protected under these laws  including the northern spotted owl  marbled murrelet  gray wolf  grizzly bear  mountain caribou  bald eagle  karner blue butterfly  red cockaded woodpecker  bull trout  and various salmon species

tax risk factors if georgia pacific s redemption of timber company common stock did not qualify for tax free treatment  georgia pacific and the former holders of timber company common stock would be subject to tax we and georgia pacific sought a ruling from the internal revenue service to the effect that neither georgia pacific nor the holders of timber company stock would recognize gain for federal income tax purposes with respect to georgia pacific s redemption of each outstanding share of timber company stock 
the internal revenue service exercised its discretion not to issue the ruling on the basis that the evidence proffered in support of the business purposes for the redemption did not meet the high standard that the published procedures of the internal revenue service require taxpayers to satisfy in order to receive favorable rulings 
as a result  we and georgia pacific received opinions from our respective tax counsel that the redemption would be tax free under section of the internal revenue code 
these opinions  however  are not binding on the internal revenue service 
if  for any reason  the redemption was not eligible for treatment under section of the internal revenue code  georgia pacific would recognize gain on the redemption and we would generally be responsible for of such liability in excess of the proceeds of the insurance policies obtained by the timber company to cover a portion of such exposure 
on september   georgia pacific entered into a closing agreement with the internal revenue service completing a pre filing review of georgia pacific s federal income tax reporting of the redemption of timber company stock 
under the terms of the closing agreement  the internal revenue service agreed that neither georgia pacific nor the former holders of timber company stock would recognize a gain or loss as a result of the redemption of timber company stock 
georgia pacific and we believe that the closing agreement is conclusive with respect to the most material tax consequences associated with georgia pacific s redemption of timber company stock  except as described below with respect to section e of the internal revenue code 
we will have to abide by potentially significant restrictions with respect to issuances of our equity securities until october the closing agreement between georgia pacific and the internal revenue service regarding georgia pacific s redemption of timber company stock is based on facts that were in existence on the date of redemption 
georgia pacific may be subject to tax under section e of the internal revenue code if acquisitions or issuances of our stock following the merger cause the former holders of timber company stock to own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
in particular  section e of the internal revenue code will apply if such issuances or acquisitions occur as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the redemption 
for this purpose  any acquisitions or issuances of our stock before october are presumed to be part of such a plan  although we and georgia pacific may be able to rebut that presumption

assuming the price of our common stock on october  was the correct measure of the fair market value of the six entities that comprised the timber company  and assuming that georgia pacific had little or no tax basis in the stock of the six entities that comprised the timber company  the federal income tax liability would be approximately billion  excluding interest and any penalties 
under the tax matters agreement between us and georgia pacific  we would be required to indemnify georgia pacific against that taxable gain if it were triggered by an acquisition or issuance of our stock 
as of the effective date of the merger  the former holders of timber company stock held approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis 
because of the change in control limitation imposed by section e of the internal revenue code  we may be limited in the amount of stock that we can issue to make acquisitions or to raise additional capital until october also  our indemnity obligation to georgia pacific might discourage  delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may consider favorable
