item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
see risk factors under item  of part i of this annual report regarding certain factors known to us that could cause reported financial information not to be necessarily indicative of future results 
overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in we position our restaurants in the high quality  quick casual mexican food segment of the restaurant industry 
our business strategy is to become the leading brand in this industry segment 
rubio s restaurants  inc was incorporated in california in and reincorporated in delaware in in may  we completed our initial public offering 
in late  as part of our expansion strategy  we initiated a franchising program 
we have three signed franchise agreements as of march   representing commitments to open units  three of which were open as of march  additionally  on april   we completed the sale of four company owned stores in the las vegas  nevada market to one of these franchisee groups 
we opened eight stores and closed three underperforming stores in our current expansion plan calls for us to open company owned restaurants in fiscal as a result of our expansion  period to period comparisons of our financial results may not be meaningful 
when a new unit opens  it will typically incur higher than normal levels of food and labor costs until new personnel gain experience 
hourly labor schedules are gradually adjusted downward during the first three months of a restaurant opening  in order to reach operating efficiencies similar to those at established units 
in calculating our comparable restaurant base  we introduce a restaurant into our comparable restaurant base once it has been in operation for calendar months 
revenues represent gross restaurant sales less coupons and other discounts and includes franchise and licensing revenue 
cost of sales is composed of food  beverage and paper supply expense 
components of restaurant labor  occupancy and other expenses 
table of contents include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses  fringe benefit costs  rent and other occupancy costs  advertising and promotion  operating supplies  utilities  maintenance and repairs and other operating expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees and includes franchise expense used in training  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to opening new units 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis including those relating to impairment of assets  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current available information  and actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us asset impairment and store closure expense reversal the company periodically assesses its ability to recover the carrying value of its long lived assets 
if the company concludes that the carrying value will not be recovered based on expected future cash flows  an impairment write down is recorded to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
impairment is reviewed at the lowest levels for which there are identifiable cash flows that are independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets 
in the company s circumstances  such analysis is performed on an individual restaurant basis 
the impairment charge is the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets for assets to be held and used and fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of 
the company makes decisions to close stores based on their cash flows and anticipated future profitability 
the company records losses associated with the closure of restaurants in the same quarter that the decision to close these restaurants is made 
these store closure charges primarily represent a liability for the future lease obligations after the expected closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
asset impairment and store closure expense are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to these restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
because of the factors used to estimate impairment and store closure expense  amounts recorded may not be sufficient  and adjustments may be necessary 
revenue recognition revenue recognition consists of the following restaurant sales revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
franchise revenue franchise revenue is comprised of area development fees  new store opening fees  royalties and information technology help desk fees 
all fees received from franchised operations are included in revenue as earned 
area development fees are recognized as revenue on the occurrence of certain deliverables at the time an initial comprehensive analysis of the entire market is delivered to the franchisee and ratably recognized as an updated analysis per restaurant site is delivered 
new store opening fees are recognized as revenue in the month a franchisee location opens 
royalties from franchised restaurants are recorded in revenue as earned 
information technology help desk fees are collected annually and are recorded ratably into revenue 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 provides accounting guidance related to stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 

table of contents  as amended  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
the company has chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
compensation expense for options granted to non employees is periodically remeasured as the underlying options vest and is recorded as expense and deferred compensation in the financial statements 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented 
our operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
information about the impact on our operating results of using sfas no 
is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations all comparisons under this heading between  and refer to the week period ended december   the week period ended december  and the week period ended december   unless otherwise indicated 
our operating results  expressed as a percentage of sales  were as follows fiscal years revenue costs and expenses cost of sales restaurant labor  occupancy and other general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses asset impairment and store closure expense reversal loss on disposal sale of property operating income loss other expense income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss includes  and  in franchise and licensing revenue for the weeks ended december  and december   respectively  and  in franchise and licensing revenue for the weeks ended december  includes  and  in franchise expense for the weeks ended december  and december   respectively  and  in franchise expense for the weeks ended december  weeks ended december  compared to the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants  and partial period operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants and a partial period of operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase in was due in part to million in sales generated by a full year of operations from units opened in and that were not in our comparable unit base previously  combined with the million from the units opened in revenues were reduced million by the closure of three and eleven under performing restaurants in and  respectively  and the franchising of four restaurants on april  in  same store sales 
table of contents increased million  or 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the increase in comparable store sales was primarily due to a decrease in transactions  offset by a increase in the average check amount 
the decrease in transactions was caused primarily from adverse weather conditions  the sluggish economy and a reduction in price promotions in connection with our concept repositioning 
we believe these factors will continue to affect our revenues in fiscal  but will be offset by the positive impact of our concept repositioning efforts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of certain retail discount programs  lower commodity prices  partially offset by cost increases associated with our concept repositioning 
restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy  and other decreased as a percentage of revenues to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales is due in part to a decrease in labor and related costs of  due to higher occupancy charges  due to higher advertising costs and from the expenses relating to our concept repositioning  which will continue into fiscal the decrease in labor and related costs was partially due to the closure of several underperforming stores in and  and the implementation of labor saving programs in early general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in the weeks ending december  from million in the weeks ended december  decreased corporate wages and training wages were offset by an increase in stock compensation and a decrease in capitalized wages in the decrease in wages was primarily related to open positions through the year and organization changes 
the decrease in training wages was primarily due to lower management turnover 
the increase in stock compensation was due to a consulting agreement with a non employee board member for various marketing and strategic corporate initiatives 
the decrease of capitalized wages was due to fewer new restaurant openings than in general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in  primarily due to our expanding revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the weeks ended december  from million in the weeks ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the eight new units opened during and the new units opened during  offset by decreased depreciation as a result of store closures and asset impairments taken in september  franchising of the four nevada restaurants in april and the closures of three restaurants in february  august and october as a percentage of sales  depreciation and amortization decreased to in from in pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  primarily due to the decrease in unit openings to eight in compared to in the average pre opening cost per new unit opening was  per unit  a decrease of  per unit from asset impairment and store closure expense reversal 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of a select number of under performing restaurants as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
additionally  we incurred million in store closure expense related to the closure or pending closure of under performing restaurants 
these special charges  which consisted primarily of lease reserves and de identification costs  were as follows a million reserve for closed stores in  million reserve for stores to be closed and million in reserves for severance and other closed store related charges 
eleven stores were closed in october  three additional stores were closed in february  august and october as of march   nine of the underlying leases related to the closed stores had been terminated with lease buyouts  and four other leases have been sublet 
the company was able to negotiate lease terminations that were more favorable than originally anticipated  in addition to lower severance related costs than anticipated and in the company reversed  of the charge for store closures 
loss on disposal sale of property 
loss on asset disposals was  in compared to  in the higher loss in primarily relates to the write off of exterior signs and additional properties related to the concept repositioning 
other expense income net 
other expense income net decreased to  expense for the weeks ended december  from  in net other income for the weeks ended december  interest income decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  the decrease is primarily due to declining interest rates paid on our investments 
in addition  the average interest rate earned on our cash balances 
table of contents decreased due to the declining interest rate environment 
interest expense remained fairly steady at  in and  in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the weeks ended december  and weeks ended december  is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book income 
the tax provision applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on pre tax income of million for the tax benefit applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on a pre tax loss of million for weeks ended december  compared to the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants  and partial period operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  results of operations reflect weeks of operations for restaurants and a partial period of operations for restaurants for the weeks ended december  revenue 
revenue increased million or  to million for the weeks ended december  from million for the weeks ended december  the increase in was due in part to million in sales generated by a full year of operations from units opened in and that were not in our comparable unit base yet  combined with the million from the units opened in revenues were negatively impacted by the closure of under performing restaurants on october  ten of these restaurants had opened prior to  and one restaurant had opened in january also negatively impacting the year over year revenue comparison was the rd week of sales in  which generated an additional million in revenue in total sales from all units that comprise our comparable base decreased million weeks vs 
week basis  or 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the decrease in comparable store sales was primarily due to a decrease in transactions due to the limited success of promotional efforts in fiscal  offset by a increase in the average check amount 
cost of sales 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to in the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a menu price increase taken at the beginning of  a focus on proper portioning in the production of menu items  and favorable commodity costs in compared to restaurant labor  occupancy and other 
restaurant labor  occupancy and other increased as a percentage of revenue to for the weeks ended december  from in the weeks ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenue is due in part to an increase in labor and related costs of 
these labor and related cost increases were primarily due to higher workers compensation costs in california  an increase in the minimum wage in california from to at the beginning of and overall wage inflation 
one of the factors that offset the labor cost increases was the closure of under performing restaurants in october of the increase in restaurant labor  occupancy and other costs  was due to higher rent and common area maintenance charges  which resulted from a greater mix of stores opened in higher rent shopping malls 
also impacting rent and common area maintenance costs were lower average unit revenue volumes  which creates higher occupancy costs as a percentage of revenue since these costs are fixed 
of the increase in restaurant labor  occupancy and other costs  was due to higher advertising costs as our company conducted additional research in to identify key issues to improve revenue 
another significant area contributing to the increase in this category was a increase in utility costs due to the higher electricity and natural gas prices during parts of in california 
on january   the california minimum wage increased from to 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for both the weeks ended december  and the weeks ended december  increased legal costs and bonuses for our field operations group were offset by lower recruiting fees and training wages in the increased legal fees primarily related to class action complaints filed against the company by former employees 
these suits involve the issue of whether certain employees and former employees in the assistant and general manager positions who worked in the california restaurants were misclassified as exempt and deprived of overtime pay 
the lower recruiting and training costs resulted from less employee turnover in the restaurants 
general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of revenue to in from in  primarily due to our expanding revenue base 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in the weeks ended december  from million in the weeks ended december  the million increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the new units opened during and the new units opened during  offset by decreased 
table of contents depreciation as a result of store closures and asset impairments taken in september and asset impairments taken in december as well 
as a percentage of sales  depreciation and amortization remained constant at in both and pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  primarily due to the decrease in unit openings to in compared to in the average pre opening cost per new unit opening year over year remained approximately the same at  per unit 
asset impairment and store closure expense 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of a select number of under performing restaurants as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
additionally  we incurred million in store closure expense related to the closure or pending closure of under performing restaurants 
these special charges  which consisted primarily of lease reserves and de identification costs  were as follows a million reserve for closed stores in  million reserve for stores to be closed and million in reserves for severance and other closed store related charges 
eleven stores were closed in october  three additional stores were closed in february  august and october as of march   nine of the underlying leases related to the closed stores had been terminated with lease buyouts and four other leases have been sublet 
because the company was able to negotiate lease terminations that were more favorable than originally anticipated  in addition to lower severance related costs than anticipated  in the company reversed  of the charge for store closures 
in  we recorded a million charge related to the impairment of a select number of under performing restaurants 
loss on disposal sale of property 
loss on asset disposals was  in compared to  in the higher loss in primarily relates to the write off of obsolete neon signs and decor packages that had been purchased in advance and included in property 
other income  net 
net interest income decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  in net interest income for the weeks ended december  interest income decreased to  for the weeks ended december  from  for the weeks ended december  the decrease is primarily due to lower average cash balances as we used cash to open restaurants in and restaurants in in addition  the average interest rate earned on our cash decreased due to the declining interest rate environment 
interest expense remained fairly steady at  in and  in income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the weeks ended december  and weeks ended december  is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pretax book loss 
the tax benefit applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on a pre tax loss of million for the tax benefit applied to comprises the federal and state statutory rates based on the annual effective rate on a pre tax loss of  for seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and semi fixed costs  as well as through increased revenues 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 
inflation components of our operations subject to inflation include food  beverage  lease  utility  labor and insurance costs 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to workers compensation insurance and utility expense has had a material impact on our results of operations in and additionally  accrued expenses and other liabilities associated with workers compensation insurance  as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets  increased by  from  as of december  to  as of december  
table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have funded our capital requirements in recent years through public sale of equity securities  private placement of preferred stock  bank debt and cash flow from operations 
we generated million in cash flow from operating activities for the weeks ended december  and million for the weeks ended december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the weeks ended december  compared to million for the weeks ended december  the million net increase in cash used was primarily due to a net million decrease in capital expenditures offset by an approximate decrease in net investment activity 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the weeks ended december  compared to net cash generated from financing activities of million for the weeks ended december  financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from exercises of common stock options  which generated  financing activities in primarily consisted of proceeds from line of credit borrowing of million 
we have a million revolving line of credit agreement with a financial institution that matures july as of december   there was million borrowed against the line and another million utilized for standby letters of credit related to our workers compensation policy 
interest on the revolving line of credit is calculated on the lower of either a bank reference rate plus  or on an adjusted london interbank offered rate plus  per annum at december  
the company was not in compliance with respect to one covenant of the credit agreement as of december  an amendment to the credit agreement was signed effective december  the result of this amendment was to put the company in compliance with the covenant that it was not in compliance with as of december  our funds were principally used for the development and opening of new units 
we incurred million in capital expenditures during the weeks ended december   of which  million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for menu board upgrades  remodels and point of sale system upgrades  million for routine capital expenditures at our existing locations and million for corporate and information technology expenditures 
we incurred million in capital expenditures during the weeks ended december   of which  million was for newly opened units  million for future openings  million for menu board upgrades  remodels and point of sale system upgrades  million for existing locations and million for corporate and information technology expenditures 
we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million  of which approximately million is forecasted for the opening of new restaurants 
we currently plan to open approximately units in we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  and  per unit  net of landlord allowances and excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant 
we undertook a number of projects in  which will carry over into that are designed to potentially improve sales 
certain of these projects  including a proposed new store design  a potential retrofit design that can be incorporated into existing restaurants  signage changes and salsa bar upgrades will require a significant amount of capital 
these projects may require that certain existing assets be disposed of as a result of these projects 
we estimate the capital requirements for these projects to be  to  per restaurant  and the asset disposals to be  to  per restaurant 
in fiscal  these projects were implemented in approximately half of our restaurants 
these projects will be completed in the balance of our restaurants during fiscal we lease restaurant and office facilities and real property under operating leases expiring through we have leased all of our facilities  except for one building  to minimize the cash investment associated with each unit 
most of our leases are for year terms and include options to extend the terms 
the majority of our leases also include fixed rate and percentage of sales rent provisions 
our future minimum lease payments for our headquarters and restaurants are expected to be as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
we believe that the anticipated cash flow from operations combined with funds currently anticipated to be available from our million credit facility and our cash and investments balance of million as of december  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
for additional information regarding our credit facility  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements on page f of this report 
changes in our operating plans  changes in our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  our ability to meet the financial covenants of our credit facility  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional or alternative financing sooner than anticipated 
additional or alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional or alternative financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost  as defined in eitf issue no 
was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations nor on the company s treatment of the store closure expense that was recorded in fiscal year item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments primarily with maturities of less than one year 
the portfolio consists primarily of corporate bonds and municipal bonds 
as of december   we have no investments that have maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the types of investment and debt instruments the company has  a change in period end interest rates or a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates would not have a significant negative affect on our financial results 
as of december   we had available million of a total million revolving line of credit with a maturity date of july as of december   we have million borrowed against this facility and million reserved as security for a standby letter of credit related to our workers compensation insurance policy that matures in october interest on the revolving line of credit is calculated on the lower of either a bank reference rate plus  or on an adjusted london interbank offered rate plus  per annum as of december  
we also pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit 
should we make additional draws on this line in the future  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense on these loans and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of less than one year 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
