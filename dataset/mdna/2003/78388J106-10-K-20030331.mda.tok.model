item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a leading independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers in the continental united states  puerto rico and the us virgin islands 
we generate revenues from our two primary businesses  site leasing and site development 
in our site leasing business  we lease antenna space to wireless service providers on towers and other structures that we own or manage for or lease from others 
the towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a carrier  built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired 
in our site development business  we offer wireless service providers assistance in developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks 
we are continuing to shift our revenue stream from project driven revenues to recurring revenues through the leasing of antenna space at  or on  communication towers 
we intend to emphasize our site leasing business through the leasing and management of tower sites 
subsequent to the consummation of the aat transaction  we intend on focusing our leasing activities in the eastern third of the united states where substantially all of our remaining towers will be located 
site leasing services site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless communications companies 
revenues from these clients are derived from numerous different site leasing contracts 
each site leasing contract relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site and is generally for an initial term of years  renewable for five year periods at the option of the tenant 
almost all of our site leasing contracts contain specific rent escalators  which average per year  including the renewal option periods 
site leasing contracts are generally paid on a monthly basis and revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease agreements 
rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenue 
cost of site leasing revenue consists of payments for rental on ground and other underlying property  repairs and maintenance exclusive of employee related costs  utilities  insurance  and property taxes 
for any given tower  such costs are relatively fixed over a monthly or an annual time period 
as such  operating costs for owned towers do not generally increase significantly as a result of adding additional customers to the tower 
our same tower revenue growth on the  towers we owned as of december  was and our same tower cash flow growth on these  towers was  based on site leasing contracts signed and annual lease contracts in effect as of december  and in february  we announced the reduction of our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities 
under this plan  we suspended any material new investment for additional towers  among other 
table of contents actions 
if the aat transaction successfully closes  we will further reduce our tower portfolio by at least towers and a maximum of towers 
we do not anticipate making any material additions to our tower portfolio in site development services site development services revenues are also received primarily from wireless communications companies or companies providing development or project management services to wireless communications companies 
our site development customers engage us on a project by project basis  and a customer can generally terminate an assignment at any time without penalty 
site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price  or milestone  basis 
time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered 
for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis  we bill the client  and recognize revenue  based on the completion of agreed upon phases or milestones of the project on a per site basis 
upon the completion of each phase we recognize the revenue related to that phase 
the majority of our site development services are billed on a fixed price basis 
our site development projects generally take from to months to complete 
our revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 
revenue from our site development business may fluctuate from period to period depending on construction activities  which are a function of the timing and amount of our clients capital expenditures  the number and significance of active customer engagements during a period  weather and other factors 
cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs  salaries and labor costs  including payroll taxes  subcontract labor  vehicle expense and other costs directly and indirectly related to the projects 
all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 
our site development revenues and profit margins decreased significantly during the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the substantial decline in capital expenditures by wireless carriers  particularly for our site development construction services  which adversely affected our volume of activity and our pricing levels 
during  we expect these trends to continue 
consequently  we anticipate continued decline in our site development revenues and profit margins 
developments in february  as a result of the continuing deterioration of the capital market conditions for wireless carriers  we announced that under a plan approved by our board of directors we were reducing our capital expenditures for new tower development and acquisition activities  suspending any material new investment for additional towers  reducing our workforce and closing or consolidating offices 
under those capital market conditions  we did not anticipate building or buying a material number of new towers beyond those we were contractually obligated to build or buy  thereby resulting in the abandonment of a majority of our then existing new tower build and acquisition work in process during in connection with this restructuring  a portion of our workforce had been reduced and certain offices have been closed  substantially all of which were primarily dedicated to new tower development activities 
in addition  during the first quarter of  certain tower assets held and used in operations were determined to be impaired and written down to their fair value 
as a result of the implementation of our plans  we recorded a restructuring charge of million in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets andemerging issues task force  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
of the million charge recorded during the year ended december   approximately million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately sites and million related to the impairment of approximately tower sites held and used in operations 
the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process resulted in the write off of all costs incurred to date 
the impairment of operating tower assets results primarily from our evaluation of the fair value of our operating tower portfolio through a discounted cash flow analysis 
towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future lease up 
the remaining million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately offices 
exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of offices primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill is no longer amortized but reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indicators of 
table of contents impairment in value are present 
under the transitional provisions of sfas  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million as of the effective date of adoption  january  the impairment charge has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  two of our three operating segments were identified as reporting units in which we recognized an impairment loss 
of the total million cumulative effect adjustment  million related to the site development construction segment and million related to our site leasing segment 
during  we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately million resulting from the achievement of certain earn out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july  in accordance with sfas  in addition to the transitional test described above  goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually  or at any time that indicators of impairment are present 
we determined that as of june  indicators of impairment were present  thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed 
the indicators of impairment during the quarter ended june  giving rise to this analysis included significant deterioration of overall company value  continued negative trends with respect to carrier capital expenditure plans and related demand for wireless construction services and perceived reduction in value of similar site development construction services businesses 
as a result of this analysis  using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value  million of goodwill within the site development construction reporting unit was determined to be impaired as of june  and was written off in the second quarter of the million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as of december  we did not have any remaining goodwill or other intangible assets subject to sfas since the beginning of  the environment for continued expenditures by wireless service providers has deteriorated 
declining subscriber growth and prospects for positive cash flow by wireless service providers have adversely affected the access to and cost of capital for wireless service provides as evidenced by declines in the market value of both their debt and equity securities 
we believe that if the capital market conditions remain difficult for the telecommunications industry  wireless service providers will choose to conserve capital and may not spend as much as originally anticipated 
if wireless carrier capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remains weak or deteriorates further  we believe our revenues and gross profit from the site development consulting and construction segments of our business  potentially the collectibility of our accounts receivable  and the valuation of certain of our long lived assets may be negatively impacted 
short term  variable capital markets conditions may adversely impact carrier demand for our tower space  and consequently our site leasing revenue and the ability of our customers to meet their obligations to us 
we believe that  over the longer term however  site leasing revenues will continue to increase as carriers continue to deploy new antenna sites to address issues of network capacity and quality 
developments in february  in response to the continued deterioration in expenditures by wireless service providers  particularly with respect to site development activities  we committed to a new plan of restructuring associated with further downsizing activities  including reduction in workforce and closing or consolidation of offices 
we anticipate closing an additional to offices and eliminating the positions of to employees during the first quarter of  substantially all related to our site development operations 
we anticipate incurring a restructuring charge related to these costs of up to million 
on march  certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with aat communications to sell towers or  if aat communications elects to purchase an additional towers  an aggregate of towers  which represent substantially all of our towers in the western two thirds of the us gross proceeds from the sale are anticipated to be million if towers are sold  or million if towers are sold  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
the aat transaction is expected to close in stages commencing on may  and ending on september  we intend to use substantially all of the proceeds  net of anticipated transaction costs of approximately million  to reduce indebtedness 
upon consummation of the complete aat transaction  we will own  towers  substantially all of which will be in the eastern third of the united states 
we entered into the aat transaction to address our anticipated non compliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness 
the sale is subject to a number of conditions  including an amendment to our senior credit facility 
we anticipate that the amendment to our senior credit facility would  among other things  waive any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a going concern qualification  modify the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during and beyond and permit certain actions that are part of the aat transaction 
we believe that the aat transaction  in 
table of contents conjunction with the anticipated amendment to the senior credit facility  will upon consummation  eliminate the issues that gave rise to the going concern qualification from our auditors 
based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity  we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either or towers  and the anticipated amendment to the senior credit facility  we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow 
going concern we have significant borrowings under our senior credit facility  our senior notes and our senior discount notes  each containing certain covenants 
among other things  these covenants restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell assets for less than fair market value  pay dividends  redeem outstanding debt or engage in other restricted payments 
if we fail to comply with these covenants  it could result in an event of default under one or all of these debt instruments 
the senior credit facility requires sba telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios  including ratios regarding it s consolidated debt coverage  debt service  cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining a minimum consolidated ebitda earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  non cash charges and unusual or non recurring expenses 
we were in full compliance with all of the financial ratios and tests as of december  based on declines that we have been experiencing in our site development business and that we believe will continue in  we estimated that we would not be in compliance with one or more of the senior credit facility s existing financial ratios or tests in as a result of these estimates and our expectations that we will not comply with one or more of the financial covenants of our senior credit facility during  the auditor s opinion on our consolidated financial statements calls attention to substantial doubts about our ability to continue as a going concern through the issuance of this audit opinion with a going concern qualification  if not remedied by april   would be an event of default under our senior credit facility 
upon the occurrence of this  or any other event of default  our lenders can prevent us from borrowing any additional amounts under the senior credit facility 
in addition  upon the occurrence of any event of default  other than certain bankruptcy events  our senior credit facility lenders  by a majority vote  can elect to declare all amounts of principal outstanding under the senior credit facility  together with all accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
the acceleration of amounts due under our senior credit facility would cause a cross default in our senior notes and our senior discount notes  thereby permitting the acceleration of such indebtedness 
if the indebtedness under the senior credit facility and or indebtedness under our senior notes or senior discount notes were to be accelerated  our current assets would not be sufficient to repay in full the indebtedness 
if we were unable to repay amounts that became due under the senior credit facility  our lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as security under the senior credit facility 
as part of our plan to address our anticipated non compliance with certain financial covenants under our senior credit facility commencing in and to reduce our significant level of indebtedness and the risks associated with such indebtedness  certain of our subsidiaries entered into a definitive agreement with aat communications to sell towers or  if aat communications elects to purchase an additional towers  an aggregate of towers 
we are also currently exploring  and may from time to time take advantage of various strategic opportunities including  but not limited to  the sale of certain assets or lines of business  the issuance of equity or the repurchasing  restructuring  or refinancing of some or all of our debt 
we believe that the aat transaction  in conjunction with the amendment to the senior credit facility  will upon consummation  eliminate the issues that gave rise to the going concern qualification from our auditors with respect to our consolidated financial statements 
furthermore  based on our current estimates  subsequent to the successful sale of either or towers  and the amendment to the senior credit facility  we expect to have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow 
however  we cannot assure you that either the aat transaction and or any other plan or action can be consummated  or if consummated  would effectively address our liquidity concerns  the possible defaults under our debt instruments or any of the other risks associated with our significant level of indebtedness 
based on our previous experience with our lender syndicate for our senior credit facility  we believe that we will be able to successfully negotiate with our present senior credit bank syndicate  an amendment to our senior credit facility that waives any default that arises as a result of receiving an audit opinion with a going concern qualification  modifies the financial covenants to levels that we believe are better aligned with our site leasing business and can be satisfied during and beyond and permits certain actions that are part of the aat transaction 
this would thereby permit us to prevent the occurrence of any event of default or the acceleration of our indebtedness 
however  our prior ability to obtain necessary waivers and or amendments does not insure our ability to obtain these waivers and or amendments  especially in light of the recent financial performance of the wireless telecommunications industry and us 

table of contents the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result from this uncertainty 
results of operations as we continue to shift our revenue mix more towards site leasing  operating results in prior periods may not be meaningful predictors of future results 
you should be aware of the dramatic changes in the nature and scope of our business when reviewing the ensuing discussion of comparative historical results 
year ended compared to year ended total revenues increased to million for from million for total site development revenue decreased to million in from million in due to a decrease in site development construction revenue 
site development construction revenue decreased to million for from million for  due primarily to reduced carrier activity and price competition resulting from lower capital expenditures by wireless carriers on or around cell sites 
we believe that wireless carriers will continue to conserve capital in  which may continue to adversely affect site development revenues 
site development consulting revenues increased to million for from million for this increase is due to several new contracts for site acquisition and zoning services from wireless communications carriers 
site leasing revenue increased to million for from million for  due to the increased number of tenants added to our towers  higher average rents received and the increase in the number of towers in our portfolio 
if the aat transaction is consummated  with the sale of either or towers  we expect to have lower leasing revenue and tower cash flow  on an absolute basis  as a result of our reduced number of towers 
we expect that leasing revenue and tower cash flow growth will continue to increase during on the towers remaining in our portfolio  however  the rate of such growth may be adversely affected by lower wireless carrier capital expenditures 
total cost of revenues increased to million for from million for site development cost of revenue decreased to million in from million in site development consulting cost of revenue increased to million for from million for  reflecting higher levels of activity and increased personnel costs 
site development construction cost of revenue decreased to million for from million for  due primarily to lower levels of activity 
site leasing cost of revenue increased to million for from million for  due to the increased number of towers owned resulting in an increased amount of lease payments to site owners and related site costs as well as increases in operating costs of sites in puerto rico  maintenance and property taxes 
gross profit increased to million for from million for  due to increased site leasing gross profit offset by a decrease in site development gross profit 
gross profit from site development decreased to million in from million in due to lower revenue and lower pricing without a commensurate reduction in cost 
gross profit margins for site development decreased in to from in gross profit margin on site development consulting decreased to for from for this decrease reflects different stages of project completions and lower pricing for our services due to competition 
gross profit margin on site development construction decreased to for from in  resulting from lower pricing due to increased competition 
we expect this pricing competition to continue and gross profit margin from site development to continue to be negatively impacted as we move through gross profit for the site leasing business increased to million in from million in and the gross profit margins on site leasing remained consistent at during and as a percentage of total revenues  gross profit increased to of total revenues in from in due primarily to increased levels of higher margin site leasing gross profit 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for from million for selling  general and administrative expenses  net of non cash compensation expense  as a percentage of total revenue has also decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense primarily resulted from a decrease in tower developmental expenses as well as the reduction of offices  elimination of personnel and elimination of other infrastructure that had previously been necessary to support our prior level of new asset growth but is no longer required as a result of the restructuring previously discussed 
included within selling  general and administrative expenses is a provision for doubtful accounts 
the provision for doubtful accounts increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting our assessment of a more challenging financial environment for our customers in and beyond 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase is directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets primarily towers we owned in as compared to  offset by a decrease in amortization resulting from the write off of goodwill which was recorded in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
previously 
table of contents discussed 
amortization of covenants not to compete in was million goodwill amortization was compared to amortization of covenants not to compete and goodwill in of million 
during the year ended december  we incurred restructuring and other charges in the amount of million  consisting primarily of million of restructuring charges and a million goodwill impairment charge 
as a result of the continued deterioration of capital market conditions for wireless carriers  a million restructuring charge was recorded due to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction activities and the impairment of certain tower assets held and used in operations 
of the million charge  approximately million related to the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process and related construction materials on approximately sites and million related to the impairment of approximately tower sites held and used in operations 
the abandonment of new tower build and acquisition work in process resulted in the full write off of all costs incurred to date 
the impairment of operational tower assets resulted primarily from our evaluation of the current projected cash flow and subsequent write down to fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
towers determined to be impaired were primarily towers with no current tenants and little or no prospects for future lease up 
the remaining million of charge related primarily to the costs of employee separation for approximately employees and exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of approximately offices 
exit costs associated with the closing and consolidation of offices primarily represented our estimate of future lease obligations after considering sublease opportunities 
operating loss was million for the year ended december   as compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended december  this increase in operating loss is a result of million of restructuring and other charge recorded in the year ended december  versus recorded in the year ended december  total other expenses increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of increased cash interest expense  increased non cash amortization of original issue discount and debt issuance costs  and a reduction in interest income 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to higher principal amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility in as compared to and to a full quarter of interest expense on our million senior notes in the first quarter of compared to a partial quarter of interest expense on these senior notes in the first quarter of although the aggregate principal amount of total debt increased from the prior year  the resulting increase in interest expense associated with the higher principal in was offset by the interest rate reduction we recognized in connection with our interest rate swap agreement 
as the interest rate swap agreement was terminated during october  our aggregate amount of interest expense would be expected to increase in future periods  excluding however  the impact of the aat transaction and the use of the proceeds to reduce our aggregate amount of outstanding indebtedness 
the increase in non cash amortization is primarily due to higher accretion on the senior discount notes 
the decrease in interest income is due to lower cash balances during during the period ended june   we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas  which was adopted effective january  as a result of completing the required transitional test  we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of million  representing the excess of the carrying value of reporting units as compared to estimated fair value at january  of the total million cumulative effect adjustment  million related to the site development construction reporting segment and million related to the site leasing reporting segment 
the change modified the first quarter s previously reported net loss of million  or per share  to million  or per share 
during  we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately million resulting from the achievement of certain earn out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july  in accordance with sfas  in addition to the transitional test described above  goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually  or at any time that indicators of impairment are present 
we determined  that as of june   indicators of impairment were present  thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed 
the indicators of impairment during the quarter ended june  giving rise to this analysis included significant deterioration of overall company market value  continued negative trends with respect to carrier capital expenditure plans  related demand for wireless construction and perceived reduction in value of similar site development construction services business 
as a result of this analysis  using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value  million of goodwill within the site development construction reporting unit was determined to be impaired as of june  the million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  net loss was million for the year ended december  as compared to net loss of million for the year ended december  this increase in net loss is primarily a result of higher depreciation expense

site development construction revenue increased to million for from million for  due primarily to revenues from companies acquired during and revenues of million were contributed by these acquired entities in our decision to reduce our level of new tower development activity may have a material adverse effect on our site development revenue in since  as a result  we do not expect to perform equipment installation work for as many first tenants as we did in site development consulting revenues were million for and site leasing revenue increased to million for from million for  due to tenants added to our towers and the substantially greater number of towers in our portfolio during as compared to total cost of revenues increased to million for from million for site development cost of revenue increased to million in from million in due to higher site development revenues

as a percentage of total revenue  excluding non cash compensation expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for from in during the twelve months ended december   we recorded a million charge relating to a reduction in the scale of our new tower construction operations 
approximately million of this charge related to costs that were previously reflected in our balance sheet as construction in process 
the remaining million related primarily to the costs of employee separation for employees and the costs associated with the closing and consolidation of selected offices that were primarily utilized in our new asset development activities 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for as compared to million for this increase was directly related to the increased amount of fixed assets  primarily towers  we owned in as compared to as our fixed assets begin to mature we will be continuing to evaluate the useful lives of the assets and may decide to change these useful lives based on the circumstances

even if we decided to pay a dividend on or make a distribution of the capital stock of our subsidiaries  we cannot assure you that our subsidiaries will generate sufficient cash flow to pay a dividend 
our ability to pay cash or stock dividends is restricted under the terms of our senior credit facility and the indentures related to our senior notes and senior discount notes

in addition to the proposed aat transaction  in order to manage our significant levels of indebtedness and to insure continued compliance with our financial covenants  we are exploring a number of alternatives  including selling certain assets or lines of business  issuing equity  repurchasing  restructuring or refinancing or exchanging for equity some or all of our debt or pursuing other financial alternatives  and we may from time to time implement one or more of these alternatives

net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million as compared to million in this decrease was primarily attributable to cash interest payments made in february and august on the senior notes 
net cash used in investing activities for year the ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to a significantly lower level of tower acquisitions and new build activity in versus net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the issuance of our million senior notes completed in february our cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of lower investment in new tower assets 
we currently plan to make total cash capital expenditures during the year ending december  of million to million 
all of these planned capital expenditures are expected to be funded by cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
the exact amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors including amounts necessary to support our tower portfolio and to complete pending build to suit obligations 
our balance sheet reflected negative working capital of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
this change is attributable to the classification of million of previously long term debt as current  based upon management s requirement to repay in substantially all of the net proceeds from the aat transaction in the amount of million  offset by higher cash balances  receipts of accounts receivable and lower accounts payable levels 
at december  we had million outstanding on our senior notes

the term loan and the revolving loan mature june  and repayment of the term loan begins in september million is due for repayment on each of september  and december  
under the current terms of the senior credit facility  we are required to use substantially all of the net proceeds of asset sales to repay outstanding debt under the senior credit facility 
as a result  we have calculated our current debt outstanding at december  to include substantially all of the net proceeds from the proposed sale of towers to aat communications of million 
however  we intend to seek an amendment to the senior credit facility and in exchange for certain modifications  we would repay approximately million of this facility in the receipt of this amendment is a condition to the consummation of the aat transaction 
borrowings under the senior credit facility accrue interest at the euro dollar rate plus a margin or a base rate plus a margin  as defined in the credit agreement 
at december   million term loan outstanding under the senior credit facility was at variable rates of to and million outstanding under the revolving credit facility was at variable rates of to 
the senior credit facility requires sba telecommunications to maintain specified financial ratios  including ratios regarding our consolidated debt coverage  debt service  cash interest expense and fixed charges for each quarter and to satisfy certain financial condition tests including maintaining minimum consolidated ebitda 
the senior credit facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants which  among other things  require us to submit audited financial statements without a going concern qualification in the audit opinion and restricts our ability to incur debt and liens  sell assets  commit to capital expenditures  enter into affiliate transactions or sale leaseback transactions  and or build towers without anchor tenants 
the august amendment adjusted certain covenants and financial covenants  but did not change the amount or repayment terms of the facility 
specifically  the august amendment amended certain financial covenants to a decrease the required ratios for cash interest expense coverage  fixed charges coverage and debt service coverage in to and b reduce the permitted senior leverage and debt per tower ratios and increased the interest margin over the euro dollar rate as specified in the original agreement by basis points 
availability under the senior credit facility is contingent upon compliance with the financial ratios and tests and other covenants in the credit agreement 
as of december  we were in full compliance with the covenants contained in the senior credit facility  however  the issuance of the audit opinion on the financial statements with a going concern qualification  if not remedied by april   would be an event of default which would permit the lenders  by a majority vote  to immediately accelerate the maturity of the principal and interest outstanding under the senior credit facility and to terminate our ability to access any remaining available funds 
our ability in the future to comply with the covenants and access the available funds under the senior credit facility in the future will depend on our future financial performance 
the senior credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of sba telecommunications and its subsidiaries 
one of our goals is the attainment of sustained positive free cash flow 
we define free cash flow as ebitda less net cash interest  cash capital expenditures and cash taxes 
we are focused on maintaining sufficient liquidity until we reach our goal of sustained positive free cash flow 
based on our current estimates of wireless carrier activity  we believe that subsequent to the successful sale of either or towers  and the amendment to the senior credit facility  we will have sufficient liquidity to achieve positive free cash flow 
free cash flow is not intended to represent cash flows for the periods presented  nor has it been presented as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as an indicator of operating performance and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have on file with the securities and exchange commission sec shelf registration statements on form s registering up to a total of million shares of class a common stock that we may issue in connection with the acquisition of wireless communication towers or companies that provide related services at various locations in the united states 
during the year ended december   we issued million shares of class a common stock under 
table of contents these registration statements in connection with one acquisition and certain earn outs 
as of december   we had million shares of class a common stock remaining available under these shelf registration statements 
we have on file with the sec a universal shelf registration statement registering the sale of up to million of any combination of the following securities class a common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares or warrants 
inflation the impact of inflation on our operations has not been significant to date 
however  we cannot assure you that a high rate of inflation in the future will not adversely affect our operating results 
effect of recently issued accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this standard requires companies to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the cost is to be capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  we either settle the obligation for its recorded amount or incur a gain or loss upon settlement 
we are required to adopt this standard effective january  we have not completed our analysis determining the effect adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements  but believe it may be material given that we have obligations to restore leaseholds to their original condition upon termination of ground leases underlying a majority of our towers 
we will record the cumulative effect of adopting this statement effective january  in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements nos 
 and  amendment of sfas no 
and technical corrections 
for most companies  sfas will require gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as extraordinary items as previously required under sfas extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in apb opinion no 
the statement also amended sfas for certain sale leasebacks and sublease accounting 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective january  pursuant to sfas  our previously reported extraordinary item will be reclassified to operating expense in consolidated financial statement presentation subsequent to december  in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullified eitf issue no 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas eitf no 
had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan 
sfas requires that the initial measurement of a liability be at fair value 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the effect of adopting sfas is not expected to be material to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements regarding the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
as such  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
as of december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
fin also clarifies requirements for the recognition of guarantees at the onset of an arrangement 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for interim or annual financial statements after december  we implemented the disclosure requirements of fin as of december  and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of this implementation 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 consideration for variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
which requires all variable interest entities vies to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interest in the vie 
in addition  the interpretation expands the disclosure requirements for both variable interest entities that are consolidated as well as vies from which the entity is a holder of a significant amount of beneficial interests  but not the majority 
fin is effective for all vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect the effect of adopting fin to be material to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
in other cases  management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates and such differences could be significant 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue from site leasing is recorded monthly and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease agreements 
rental amounts received in advance are recorded in deferred revenues 
site development projects in which we perform consulting services include contracts on a time and materials basis or a fixed price basis 
time and materials based contracts are billed at contractual rates as the services are rendered 
for those site development contracts in which we perform work on a fixed price basis  site development billing and revenue recognition is based on the completion of agreed upon phases of the project on a per site basis 
upon the completion of each phase on a per site basis  we recognize the revenue related to that phase 
revenue related to services performed on uncompleted phases of site development projects was not recorded by us at the end of the reporting periods presented as it was not material to our results of operations 
any estimated losses on a particular phase of completion are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
site development projects generally take from to months to complete 
revenue from construction projects is recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting  determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to management s estimated total anticipated cost for each contract 
this method is used because management considers total cost to be the best available measure of progress on the contracts 
these amounts are based on estimates  and the uncertainty inherent in the estimates initially is reduced as work on the contracts nears completion 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents expenses incurred and revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
cost of site development project revenue and construction revenue include all material costs  salaries and labor costs  including payroll taxes  subcontract labor  vehicle expense and other costs directly related to the projects 
all costs related to site development projects and construction projects are recognized as incurred 
cost of site leasing revenue include rent  maintenance exclusive of employee related costs and other tower expenses 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined to be probable 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 

table of contents property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset  industry practice and asset maintenance policies 
maintenance and repair items are expensed as incurred 
asset classes and related estimated useful lives are as follows towers and related components years furniture  equipment and vehicles years buildings and improvements years capitalized costs incurred subsequent to when an asset is originally placed in service are depreciated over the remaining estimated useful life of the respective asset 
changes in an asset s estimated useful life are accounted for prospectively  with the book value of the asset at the time of the change being depreciated over the revised remaining useful life term 
we evaluate the potential impairment of individual long lived assets  principally the tower sites 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment in towers has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the then current carrying value of the investment in the tower site 
we consider many factors and make certain assumptions when making this assessment  including but not limited to general market and economic conditions  historical operating results  geographic location  lease up potential  and expected timing of lease up 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in addition  if our assumptions regarding future undiscounted cash flows and related assumptions are incorrect  a future impairment charge may be required 
the restructuring and other charges of million recorded in includes a million asset impairment charge 
the asset impairment charge was determined through an evaluation of our tower asset portfolio using a projected cash flow analysis and assets were written down to fair value determined on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the tower assets determined to be impaired were primarily those with no current tenants and little or no lease up potential 
long lived assets are subject to an impairment assessment any time that indicators of impairment are present 
if wireless carrier capital expenditures and their ability to access capital remain weak or deteriorate further  we believe the valuation of certain of our long lived assets may be negatively impacted 
in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas applies to all long lived assets including discontinued operations and consequently amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas on january  
table of contents goodwill during  we completed the transitional impairment test of goodwill required under sfas  which was adopted effective january  as a result of completing the required transitional test  we recorded a charge retroactive to the adoption date for the cumulative effect of the accounting change in the amount of million  representing the excess of the carrying value of reporting units as compared to their estimated fair value 
of the total million cumulative effect adjustment  million related to the site development construction reporting segment and million related to the site leasing reporting segment 
the change modified the first quarter s previously reported net loss of million  or per share to million  or per share 
during  we recorded additional goodwill totaling approximately million resulting from the achievement of certain earn out obligations under various construction acquisition agreements entered into prior to july  in accordance with sfas  in addition to the transitional test described above  goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually  or at any time that indicators of impairment are present 
we determined that as of june  indicators of impairment were present  thereby requiring an impairment analysis be completed 
the indicators of impairment during the quarter ended june  giving rise to this analysis included significant further deterioration of company value  further activities under our restructuring plan  and market conditions related to demand for wireless construction services 
as a result of this analysis  using a discounted cash flow valuation method for estimating fair value  million of goodwill within the site development construction segment was determined to be impaired as of june  the million goodwill impairment charge is included within restructuring and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  as of december  we did not have any remaining goodwill or other intangible assets subject to sfas restructuring accruals in establishing the accrual for the restructuring costs discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we made certain assumptions to estimate future severance costs and other exit costs 
in addition  while performing impairment tests for certain long term assets  assumptions were made as to the future cash flows associated with these assets 
while we feel the assumptions were appropriate  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from estimates used to establish the restructuring accrual 
if actual results differ from the estimates  we may need to adjust  upward or downward  our restructuring accrual in the future 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax liability as of december  was million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks that are inherent in our financial instruments 
these instruments arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business  and in some cases relate to our acquisition of related businesses 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our senior credit facility and any future financing requirements 
substantially of our indebtedness currently consists of fixed rate debt 

table of contents the following table presents the future principal payment obligations and weighted average interest rates associated with our long term debt instruments  assuming our actual level of long term indebtedness as of december  thereafter fair value in thousands long term debt fixed rate fixed rate term loan  million  variable rates to at december  revolving loan  variable rates to at december  notes payable  variable rates to at december  in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of a favorable interest rate environment by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
the notional principal amount of the interest rate swap was million 
the maturity date of the interest rate swap matched the principal maturity date of the senior notes  the underlying debt february 
this swap involved the exchange of fixed rate payments for variable rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
the variable rates were based on six month euro rate plus and were reset on a semi annual basis 
the counter party to the interest rate swap agreement elected to terminate the swap agreement effective october  in connection with this termination  the counter party paid us million  which included approximately million in accrued interest 
the remaining million received was deferred and is being recognized as a reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the senior notes using the effective interest method 
the deferred gain balance of million at december  is included in long term debt 
our primary market risk exposure relates to the interest rate risk on variable rate long term and short term borrowings  our ability to refinance our senior notes and our senior discount notes  at maturity at market rates  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet financial covenants 
we manage the interest rate risk on our outstanding long term and short term debt through our use of fixed and variable rate debt 
while we cannot predict or manage our ability to refinance existing debt or the impact interest rate movements will have on our existing debt  we continue to evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 
senior discount note disclosure requirements the indentures governing our senior notes and our senior discount notes require certain financial disclosures for restricted subsidiaries separate from unrestricted subsidiaries and the disclosure to be made of tower cash flow  as defined in the indentures  for the most recent fiscal quarter and adjusted consolidated cash flow  as defined in the indentures  for the most recently completed four quarter period 
as of december  we had no unrestricted subsidiaries 
tower cash flow  as defined in the indentures  for the quarter ended december  was million 
adjusted consolidated cash flow for the year ended december  was million
