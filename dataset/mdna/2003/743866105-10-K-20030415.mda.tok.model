item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction provident financial group  inc provident is a holding company for the provident bank the bank  an fdic member bank 
major business lines are commercial banking  a provider of credit products and cash management services to commercial customers  retail banking  a provider of consumer loans and leases  deposit accounts  trust  brokerage and investment products and services  and mortgage banking  an originator and servicer of conforming and nonconforming residential loans to consumers and short term financing to mortgage originators and brokers 
restatement of financial results on march   provident announced that it would restate its operating results for the years through and the interim periods for the restatement of previously reported operating results were attributed to unintentional errors in the accounting for nine auto lease financing transactions originated between and the errors that existed in the accounting for these transactions were first discovered by internal finance staff in connection with the testing and installation of a financial model that identified differences in income that was originally recorded  compared with the income generated by the financial model 
a review of the accounting for the nine transactions also concluded that none of the transactions should have been reported as off balance sheet leases 
the appropriate accounting was to report the transactions as on balance sheet leases with all assets and related liabilities included on the balance sheet 
provident s audit committee  through legal counsel  engaged the accounting firm of pricewaterhousecoopers llp on march  for the purpose of conducting a review of the company s restatement 
provident s management affirmed  based upon the review of its advisors  its prior conclusion that the accounting errors that led to the restatement were unintentional 
however  another issue surfaced as a result of the independent review 
provident has historically recorded its auto leases as direct finance leases 
this matches interest income with interest expense and is similar to how provident records all of its loans 
provident has now determined that its auto leases do not meet the requirements for direct finance lease classification under financial accounting standards no 
 titled accounting for leases 
since  an important factor provident has relied upon in determining the classification of its auto lease portfolio has been its residual value insurance 
in general  provident has obtained residual value insurance for its auto leases on a pool basis by year of origination 
its insurance is commonly referred to as capped insurance 
provident has now determined that this type of insurance coverage  while effective in removing residual risk  does not result in direct finance lease classification for its auto leases 
as a result  provident has reclassified all of the auto leases on its balance sheet as operating leases and reported them as leased equipment  instead of provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations finance leases  which were previously reported in the loan category 
the reclassification will affect auto leases originated from through during this period  the company s auto lease originations totaled billion and had a remaining balance of billion at december  income to be recognized in future years  beginning with  will be increased by an aggregate amount substantially similar to the additional restatement 
in addition  this restatement has no impact on provident s cash flows 
the results of the restatement are reflected in the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and selected financial data for all periods reported upon in this form k 
see note included in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning the restatement

provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net income and financial performance ratios improved for as compared to due primarily to lower credit charges 
the provision for loan and lease losses decreased million  while other credit costs included in noninterest expense representing charges for the write down of foreclosed property and leased equipment decreased million 
the higher than normal provision and credit related costs in were due primarily to the weakened economy and the events of september  although the economy remained sluggish during  credit related volatility began to stabilize 
as a result of the improved loan quality outlook and the charge off of several loans and leases that had been part of the year end loan loss reserve  provident lowered its loan loss reserve ratio from to during the lower net income and financial performance ratios for as compared to were principally the result of two factors 
first  earnings were affected by adverse economic conditions as well as the negative impact the september events had on the airline industry 
during the second half of  provident recorded additional credit costs and other expenses of million related to the events of september of which million were for secured commercial airline loans and leases and million were for other industry loans and leases 
in light of provident s analyses of its lending portfolio and changes in asset quality indicators  as reflected by higher charge offs  declining credit quality ratios and the uncertain economic environment  provident increased its loan loss reserve ratio from to during a second reason for lower earnings in was management s decision to change the structure of its securitizations to secured financings  eliminating the use of gain on sale accounting 
the switch to secured financing structures  which was made during the third quarter of  does not affect the total profit provident will recognize over the life of a loan  but rather impacts the timing of income recognition 
secured financing transactions  on a comparative basis  cause reported earnings from securitized loans to be lower in the initial periods and higher in later periods  as interest is earned on the loans 
no gains were recognized from securitization transactions during while million was recognized during revenue net interest income plus noninterest income increased during over and during over net interest income increased million  or  for compared to  after increasing million  or  in compared to higher net interest income was primarily the result of growth in the investment portfolio for and in the lending portfolio for noninterest income increased million in while increasing million in the increase in noninterest income during and was primarily the result of an increase in leasing income in both years 
gain on sales of loans and leases  a component of noninterest income  was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the increase for was primarily the result of gains recognized from whole loan sales without recourse of residential loans  while the decrease for resulted from management s decision to restructure securitizations as secure financings and thereby eliminate the use of gain on sale accounting as was employed in provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations total noninterest expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
included in is million for merger and restructuring charges related to the acquisition of fidelity financial of ohio and other post merger business line restructurings 
the increase in noninterest expense during was primarily the result of three activities 
first  provident is investing in businesses where strong growth opportunities exist  including middle market commercial lending  middle market equipment leasing and mortgage servicing 
also  significant investments continue to be made within the credit and risk management functions 
offsetting these increases were lower write downs of foreclosed properties and leased equipment 
the increase in noninterest expense during was primarily the result of an increase in leasing expense 
noninterest expense during was also impacted by activities of red capital group  which was acquired in the second half of  and additional investments being made within existing businesses where growth opportunities exist 
total assets at december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
total assets increased during primarily as a result of an increase in investment securities  middle market equipment lease financing and home equity loans 
partially offsetting these increases were reductions in nonconforming residential loans  structured finance loans  large equipment leases and auto leases 
the fluctuations in these loan and lease balances reflect management s decision to lower the risk profile of its loan and lease portfolio 
the growth for was primarily the result of the decision to hold loans and leases originated during the first half of on the balance sheet 
nonperforming assets at december  decreased from year end  while year end significantly increased from year end the ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the changes in nonperforming asset levels and other asset quality indicators resulted in decisions to lower the ratio of reserve for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases by basis points to as of december   and increase the ratio by basis points to as of year end total deposits for  and were billion  billion and billion  respectively 
commercial deposits increased to billion during while retail deposits increased to billion during offsetting the increase in retail deposits was a decrease in securitization trust deposits held as credit enhancements  which were released during shareholders equity at december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in shareholders equity during was due principally to earnings exceeding dividends paid and an increase in the mark to market on investment securities 
the decrease in shareholders equity during was primarily the result of the adoption of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and dividends paid 
provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business initiatives during the past two years  provident s profitability has been significantly impacted by the downturn in the nation s economy and the resulting credit deterioration of its lending portfolio 
in order to compete effectively in today s economy and grow shareholder value  provident s goal is to become a lower risk company engaged in achieving predictable and profitable long term earnings growth 
examples of how this goal is being achieved follows o discontinued or de emphasized higher risk lending products provident is reducing or exiting businesses with higher credit risk and where the benefits received do not justify the risks taken 
provident has de emphasized both its structured finance business unit and its nonconforming residential lending portfolio 
structured finance provided senior debt to support leveraged financings including management buyouts  recapitalizations  acquisitions and business expansions 
while provident continues to originate nonconforming residential loans  these loans are no longer being held  but are sold with no retained recourse credit risk 
these loans are being sold to third parties whereby provident recognizes a gain on the sale and sometimes ongoing loan servicing fees 
lending businesses where originations have been significantly reduced include large equipment leasing and auto leasing business units 
large equipment leasing is the financing of assets such as corporate and commercial aircraft  construction  distribution  manufacturing and mining equipment  as well as transportation equipment including trucks  tractors and freight containers 
auto lease originations have also been significantly reduced due to the overall complexity of the business and its thin margins 
management believes that capital could be better deployed elsewhere 
o expansion of lower risk lending products funding formerly used in the higher risk areas noted above is being re deployed toward lending products which have lower credit risk and less volatile earnings 
provident is currently expanding its regional commercial banking  middle market equipment leasing  and prime home equity business units 
each of these business units are viewed by management as being areas of expertise for provident with lower risk profiles and where growth opportunities exist 
o monitoring of risk over the past year  provident has significantly enhanced its monitoring of risk within the company 
the credit and risk management group is responsible for establishing the framework for managing and overseeing provident s credit  operational and compliance risks 
accomplishments within this area include improved and expanded credit policies  implementation of an expanded risk rating system and updated credit risk factors  as well as the addition of portfolio and information specialists  retail analytics staff and centralized risk management operation units 
this has resulted in the timely resolution of credit issues  improved credit quality and improved reporting  analysis and forecasting of the credit quality of the lending portfolio 
provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations o expansion of fee revenue businesses provident is also investing in businesses that generate fee income 
these businesses provide provident with a steady stream of income  with lower risk  while utilizing lower levels of capital 
businesses which fit this description include red capital group  capstone and mortgage banking 
each of these businesses provide a platform to generate fee income from originating  selling and servicing of commercial and residential mortgage loans 
o higher concentration of transaction deposits stronger efforts are being made to obtain low cost transaction deposits 
included in these efforts is the offering of a no fee deposit account product  improved service and delivery processes  the use of vista  a state of the art contact management and relationship building software tool  in all branches  increased training and enhanced incentive plans for branch associates  expanded focus on commercial lending relationships to include their deposit business  and improved internet banking capabilities

risk measurements are applied to credit  operational and other corporate level risks 
o transfer pricing provident utilizes a matched funded transfer pricing methodology that in most cases isolates the business units from fluctuations in interest rates  and provides management with the ability to measure business unit  product and customer level profitability based on the financial characteristics of the products rather than the level of interest rates 
provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations o provision for loan and lease losses business lines are charged for provision based upon its level of net charge offs as well as the size and composition of its lending portfolio 
o cost allocations provident applies a detailed approach to allocating costs at the business unit  product and customer levels 
allocations are generally based on volume activity and are reviewed and updated regularly

business line descriptions and analyses follow o commercial banking provides a broad range of commercial banking and commercial real estate products and services 
areas of focus and expertise include regional middle market lending  equipment leasing and financing  cash management  and loan servicing  transaction structuring and commercial mortgage banking services for the multi family housing industry 
net income for commercial banking for the years ending december   and was million  and million  respectively 
the fluctuation in net income can be primarily attributed to provision and other credit related charges 
commercial banking performed well during the first three quarters of asset growth was strong and income benefited from gains recognized from the securitization of equipment leases 
however  during the fourth quarter of  commercial banking began to feel the impact of a slowing economy 
during that quarter  commercial banking took several large charge offs and placed additional loans on nonaccrual which significantly reduced income 
the condition of the economy continued to decline during which was accentuated by the impact of the events of september  the majority of the decline in income during was related to credit write offs and residual impairments from loans and leases to the commercial airline industry 
in addition  net income was reduced as a result of a higher level of loan loss reserve to total loans and the change in securitization structures which eliminated gain on sale accounting 
although the economy has not recovered  credit related volatility declined during commercial banking benefited from lower provision and other credit related charges during as compared to as a result of earnings volatility  management is repositioning this business line so it can grow with a more predictable earnings pattern 
management is de emphasizing its higher credit risk areas of structured finance lending and large equipment leasing while growing its lower credit risk areas of middle market leasing and regional middle market commercial lending units

net income increased during primarily as a result of increased net interest income on deposits and lower provision for loan and lease losses 
the lower provision was due to slower loan growth and a lower level of loan loss reserves as compared to the decrease in net income for was related primarily to higher loan loss provision and lower gain on sales of loans revenue 
the higher provision was due to higher loan growth and a higher level of loan loss reserves as compared to loans and auto leases for retail banking were flat during and increased during an increase in home equity loans was offset by a decrease in auto leases during both home equity loans and auto leases increased in retail banking is expanding its home equity product line to lower the overall risk profile of its lending portfolio 
auto leasing is being de emphasized as it is a complex business with thin margins 
retail banking has experienced growth in deposits during both and average retail deposits grew by during and during deposit growth in came primarily from growth in transaction accounts

provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a significant change in the portfolio composition has and will continue to occur as a result of these strategic decisions 
risk and return  volatility and portfolio suitability have all been important considerations in this change 
these initiatives include de emphasizing the structured finance lending as well as originating the nonconforming residential loans only for sale on a whole loan basis 
regional middle market commercial lending  middle market leasing and prime home equity loans are businesses which management believes can be grown while generating more predictable future earnings streams 
enhanced processes have improved our understanding of publicly identified exit portfolios and the value of our continuing businesses and relationships 
more active use of an independent special assets division  a revamped internal portfolio risk review unit  and an expanded credit officer network allow provident to ensure independent oversight and improved communication of issues and problems throughout the portfolio 
in addition  credit and risk management is responsible for the establishment and oversight of provident s credit risk policies addressing underwriting standards  internal lending limits and methodologies for monitoring credit risk within the various loan and lease portfolios 
changes to these policies enhance provident s initial and ongoing risk management and monitoring capabilities 
provident has expanded and improved its analytical and reporting capacity  which in turn has improved the timeliness and value of portfolio information 
loans and leases are primarily monitored by closely following changes and trends in risk characteristics 
the characteristics are analyzed using various techniques  including  credit scoring models for consumer and small business loans and leases and risk ratings for larger commercial  commercial mortgage and commercial construction loans 
these risk ratings are assigned based upon individual credit analysis and are aggregated for reporting to senior management on a regular basis 
these same analytics serve as the basis for refining the rating system  and establishing portfolio wide targets and caution levels 
early trends and thresholds trigger changes in strategy and tactics including the use of secondary market alternatives to liquidate and mitigate problem exposures and portfolio segments 
provident maintains a reserve for loan and lease losses to absorb losses from current outstandings and potential usage of unfunded commitments 
discussion and analysis of the reserves as well as the overall credit quality of the off balance sheet lending portfolio is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following paragraphs provide information concerning its on balance sheet credit portfolio and unused commitments 
the reserve for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level which management considers adequate to absorb loan and lease losses given the conditions at the time 
the reserve is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses 
loans and leases deemed uncollectible are charged off and deducted from the reserve while recoveries on loans and leases previously charged off are added back to the reserve 
provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the adequacy of the reserve for loan and lease losses is monitored on a regular basis and reflects management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  specific industry trends  loan concentrations  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  payment histories  collateral valuations  historic charge off and recovery experience  estimates of charge offs for the upcoming year and other pertinent information 
based upon the analyses  provident lowered its loan loss reserve to total loans by basis points to during after raising the reserve ratio by basis points in unfavorable business conditions and difficulties experienced by the airline industry have caused provident to take large loan loss provisions during the past three years 
late in the fourth quarter of  provident placed three large loans  totaling million  on nonaccrual status 
additionally  several large commercial loan charge offs were recorded at that time 
nonaccrual loans and charge offs increased during as the economic climate continued to deteriorate  particularly with regard to the airline industry 
during  provident recorded charge offs  write downs and additional provision of million on commercial airline loans and leases 
another million of provision was recorded for industries other than commercial airlines that were related to the events of september  during  provident recorded an additional million of credit costs related to the airline industry 
although the economy remained sluggish during  credit related volatility began to stabilize 
corporate nonaccrual loans have declined million since year end the reserve methodology considers potential losses in the commercial airline portfolio as well as all other loan and lease types 
risks in the commercial airline portfolio arise from principal reliance on borrower credit quality and secondarily on equipment value 
based upon previous peak outstandings  the majority of commercial airline loans and leases are to borrowers considered to have better credit quality 
even within this segment  shorter maturities have left provident exposed to residual equipment values resulting in modest charge offs 
most of the prior charge offs and valuation adjustments dealt with transactions related to borrowers with weaker credit quality  which exposed provident to weaker equipment values 
however  future events could occur that may negatively impact our assessment of borrowers credit quality and equipment values leading to higher reserves and potential future losses

total assets 

loans and leases are generally placed on nonaccrual status when the payment of principal and or interest is past due days or more 
however  installment loans are not placed on nonaccrual status because they are charged off in the month the loans and leases reach days past due 
in addition  loans that are well secured and in the process of collection are not placed on nonaccrual status 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  any interest income previously recognized that has not been received is reversed from income 
future interest income is recorded only when a payment is received and collection of principal is considered reasonably assured 
although loans and leases may be classified as nonaccrual  many continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than the original contractual rates

off balance sheet and derivative arrangements asset securitization activity from through the second quarter of  the structure of some of provident s securitizations resulted in the transactions being accounted for as sales through the use of special purpose entities 
as such  gains or losses were recognized  loans and leases were removed from the balance sheet and residual assets  representing the present value of future cash flows  were recorded 
during the third quarter of  management decided to structure all future securitizations as secured financings thereby eliminating the use of gain on sale accounting and leaving all debt on the balance sheet 
the switch to a secured financing structure does not affect the total profit provident will recognize over the life of the asset  but rather impacts the timing of income recognition 
secured financing transactions  as compared to transactions accounted for as sales  cause reported earnings from securitized assets to be lower in the initial periods and higher in later periods  as interest is earned on the assets 
the securitization and sale of loans and leases from through the first half of continues to impact the current presentation of provident s financial condition  results of operations and off balance sheet market risks

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the securitization and sale of nonconforming residential and prime home equity loans have resulted in the recognition of non cash gains 
gains recognized under this structure are referred to as non cash gains as provident receives cash equal to the amount of loans sold 
the gains or losses are determined based on a present value calculation of future cash flows of the underlying loans  net of interest payments to security holders  loan loss and prepayment assumptions and normal servicing revenue 
these net cash flows  which are represented by retained interests on securitized assets risas  are included in investment securities 
no risas have been recorded since june cash gains have been recognized from the securitization and sale of equipment leases 
under the structure of these securitizations  provident sells the lease payments under the lease contract but retains ownership of the underlying equipment 
the cash received from these sales exceeds the present value of the lease payments and generates the cash gain 
provident retains the servicing of the loans and leases it securitizes 
as a result  a significant level of assets is serviced by provident  which do not appear on its balance sheet 
these off balance sheet assets contributed to the generation of approximately million in loan servicing fees during impact on consolidated balance sheets securitized loans and leases that have been treated as sales have been removed from the balance sheet

provident has provided collateral to its securitizations structured as sales in the form of cash  loans and an unfunded secured demand note

under the fannie mae dus program  red mortgage underwrites  funds and sells mortgage loans on multifamily rental projects 
red mortgage then services these mortgage loans on fannie mae s behalf 
participation in the fannie mae dus program requires red mortgage to share the risk of loan losses with fannie mae 
the substance of this loss sharing arrangement is that red mortgage and fannie mae split losses with one third of all losses assumed by red mortgage and two thirds of all losses assumed by fannie mae 
red mortgage services multifamily mortgage loans under the dus program with outstanding principal balances aggregating approximately billion at december  at december   no dus loans in red mortgage s loan servicing portfolio were in default 
red mortgage has established reserves of approximately million for possible losses under this program 
the reserve is determined by evaluating pools of homogenous loans and includes information based upon industry and historical loss experience  as well as each project s recent operating performance 
management believes the reserve is maintained at a level that adequately provides for the inherent losses within red mortgage s portfolio of dus loans

interest rate swaps and caps at december   provident held billion in interest rate swaps on which it receives payments at fixed interest rates while making payments at variable interest rates 
these instruments are used primarily as a hedge to offset time deposit accounts and debt where provident must pay interest at fixed rates 
as funds received on these interest rate swaps match the fixed rate payments required of the time deposits and debt  these derivatives provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations essentially convert long term fixed rate instruments into shorter repricing instruments 
provident also had billion in interest rate swaps that it receives payments at floating interest rates while making payments at fixed interest rates 
the primary use of these instruments is for off balance sheet securitizations 
provident is required to pay investors of these securitizations interest at a floating rate  however  many of the underlying loans pay interest to provident at fixed or longer term adjustable rates 
the use of these interest rate swaps allows provident to offset the floating interest rate payments to the investors with floating interest rates payments received from the interest rate swaps 
the fixed or longer term adjustable interest rate payments received from the underlying loans are used to offset the fixed rate interest payments required on these interest rate swaps 
provident has approximately billion in purchased interest rate caps 
interest rate caps protect against the impact of rising interest rates on interest bearing financial instruments 
when interest rates go above a cap s strike rate  the cap provides for receipt of payments based on its notional amounts 
risks involved in these purchased interest rate caps have been mitigated by selling billion in interest rate caps 
the fair value of these interest rate swaps and caps are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as either other assets derivatives with a positive fair value or as other liabilities derivatives with a negative fair value as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no

liquidity adequate liquidity is necessary to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of customers as well as to satisfy liabilities  fund operations and support asset growth 
management forecasts that the largest liquidity needs during will come from growth in the lending portfolio  maturing of retail and brokered certificates of deposit  and scheduled principal payments on long term debt 
provident has a variety of sources to meet these liquidity demands 
first  management expects to issue new certificates of deposit along with renewing many of its maturing certificates of deposit 
management also projects growth within retail transactional deposits 
additional sources of liquidity include the secured financing of commercial and consumer loans and leases  whole loan sales of nonconforming residential loans and the availability to borrow both short term and long term funds

ratings related liquidity events may include reduced availability of short term federal funds  reduced availability to the surety bond market that supports the bank s public funds program and other commitments provided to third parties in related business transactions 
if such ratings events are anticipated  management will take actions to enhance balance sheet liquidity positions to meet liquidity needs 
such actions to enhance liquidity positions were taken in connection with provident s march  announcement related to the restatement of its earnings 
in anticipation of potential ratings downgrades  management took actions to enhance liquidity positions  including issuance of additional brokered certificates of deposits 
additional term liquidity reduces reliance on short term funding and increases the availability of collateral in the investment portfolio 
management will continue to monitor events as the need may arise for further liquidity enhancements in the future 
the parent company s primary liquidity needs during will be the payment of dividends to its preferred and common shareholders  funds for activity of the commercial paper operations and interest payments on junior subordinated debentures 
the major source of liquidity for the parent company is dividends and interest paid to it by its subsidiaries 
provident received dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the amount of dividends available for payment in by the provident bank  provident s banking subsidiary  is approximately million  plus net income 
it is unlikely  however  that the bank would pay annual dividends to the parent company that exceeds million 
the parent company also received interest payments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  from its subsidiaries 
these interest payments were primarily the result of million of subordinated debt loaned to the bank 
the subordinated debt matures during and management believes that dividends and interest payments from the bank will be sufficient to meet the parent company s liquidity requirements in at december   the parent company had million in general purpose lines of credit with unaffiliated banks 
the principal purpose of these lines was to provide a backup facility for its commercial paper program 
in july  the parent company issued million of long term senior notes to improve its overall liquidity position 
proceeds from these notes have provided sufficient incremental liquidity to meet its short term obligations and have eliminated the primary use of the lines 
the lines were not renewed at their march  expiration date 
the lines of credit had not been drawn upon during the past three years

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies note to the notes to consolidated financial statements lists significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of provident s financial statements 
however  four of these accounting policies are considered to be critical due to the level of sensitivity and subjectivity of their underlying accounting estimates 
these critical accounting policies concern the adequacy of the reserve for loan and lease losses  the valuation of retained interest in securitized assets risas and securitized credit enhancements  the valuation of mortgage servicing assets  and the valuation of derivatives 
reserve for loan and lease losses provident maintains a reserve to absorb potential loan and lease losses inherent in its lending portfolio 
management s determination of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve is based on an assessment of the potential losses given the conditions at the time 
this assessment consists of certain loans and leases being evaluated on an individual basis  as well as all loans and leases being categorized based on common credit risk attributes and being evaluated as a group 
management evaluates numerous factors including the credit quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  specific industry trends  loan concentrations  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  payment histories  collateral valuations  historical charge off and recovery experience  estimates of charge offs for the upcoming year and other relevant information 
loans and leases that have been placed on classified and or nonaccrual status are further evaluated for potential losses based upon review and discussion among credit  portfolio risk review  lending officers  collection associates  and senior management 
factors considered include the market value of collateral or real estate associated with a specific loan or lease  cash flows generated by the borrower  third party guarantees  the general economic climate and any specific industry trends that may affect an individual loan or lease 
additional loss estimates associated with securitized assets and loans sold under the fannie mae dus program are provided for separately from the reserve for loan and lease losses

risas and securitized credit enhancements prior to july  provident structured its securitization transactions as sales 
as such  provident retained a future cash flows of the underlying loans  net of payments due to investors of the securitization trust  servicing fees and other fees risas  b servicing rights on the loans and leases  and c credit enhancement accounts used to absorb credit losses on the loans securitized 
gain or loss on the sale of the loans depended in part on the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the assets retained based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
however  quotes are generally not available provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for assets retained  so provident estimates the fair value based on key assumptions  including prepayment speeds  credit losses  forward yield curves  and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
provident monitors the valuation of the risas on a monthly basis 
the valuation centers primarily around two estimates  total life time credit losses and the constant prepayment rate cpr 
during the current year  both of these factors have trended upward which has had an unfavorable impact on the nonconforming residential risa valuation 
additionally  the cpr has also been impacted by management s decision to accelerate the liquidation of other real estate associated with the securitized nonconforming residential portfolio 
provident models a cpr range from to with the actual cpr currently running at 
if the cpr stays at its current level  management estimates that there would be sufficient cash flows to absorb lifetime losses up to 
if the cpr rises to  there would be sufficient cash flows to absorb lifetime losses up to 
cumulative incurred losses through december  are  with estimated total lifetime losses expected to be 
on a worst case basis  management currently estimates that lifetime losses should not exceed assuming real estate values remain relatively stable 
from an earnings sensitivity standpoint  above certain loss thresholds  basis points in losses represent a million unfavorable after tax impact 
should both the estimated life time credit losses and cpr continue to rise  impairment of the risa value could occur 
future period cash flow realizations may differ from current projections as a result of timing differences in credit related charge offs in any given period 
although these variances may not change the life time loss assumptions  they may result in temporary negative cash flows and the possibility of a charge to earnings 
at december   management believes the current carrying value of the risa asset is properly stated 
additional sensitivity analyses is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights provident recognizes the rights to service mortgage loans it does not own but services for others within other assets of its balance sheets 
mortgage servicing assets are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value  adjusted for amortization  or estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on projected discounted cash flows which takes into consideration estimated servicing fees  prepayment speeds  discount rates  earnings on deposit of escrow funds and other assumptions 
these estimates have a significant impact on the valuation of the mortgage servicing assets 
mortgage servicing rights are tested quarterly to verify the market value equals or exceeds its carrying value 
valuation of derivatives in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  provident carries the fair value of derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets with changes in value recorded in the income statement or as other comprehensive income 
although the value of the derivatives are determined using third party valuations  these valuations use discounted cash flow modeling techniques  which require the use of assumptions concerning the amount and timing of future cash flows 
these estimates have a significant impact on the valuation of the derivatives

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the responsibility of monitoring and managing market and liquidity risk is assigned to the asset liability committee alco 
the main component of market risk is the risk of loss in the value of financial instruments that may result from the changes in interest rates 
alco is bound to guidelines stated in the relevant policies approved by the board of directors 
in addition to the natural balance sheet hedges  alco utilizes derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk on and off its balance sheet 
interest rate swaps and caps are the most widely used tools to manage interest rate risk 
provident uses an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the model evaluates the effect of changes in interest rates on net interest income by running various interest rate scenarios up and down from a flat rate scenario 
as a basis for strategic interest rate risk management  the alco group regularly analyzes the impact of four to six additional interest rate scenarios on net interest income in addition to the standard scenarios used for policy measurement 
these rate scenarios are established by alco and incorporate changes to the slope of the yield curve 
the balance sheet assumptions  including loan growth  funding mix  and prepayment speeds primarily on mortgage related products  are adjusted for each rate scenario 
market based prepayment speeds are incorporated into the analysis  particularly for mortgage related products  including investment portfolio securities 
faster prepayments during low interest rate environments such as the current levels negatively impact interest rate margins due to lower reinvestment yields 
provident s policy limit stipulates that the negative impact on net interest income from a basis points  month gradual parallel ramp rate scenario as compared to the flat rate scenario cannot exceed percent over the next month period 
these tests are performed on a monthly basis  and the results are presented to the board of directors 
based on the results of the simulation model  net interest income would change by the following over the next month period basis points decrease basis points increase basis points decrease n a n a basis points increase due to the current low interest rate environment  nothing beyond a basis point decrease was simulated for although classified as leased equipment  provident continues to include auto leases in its interest sensitivity analysis 
alco regularly incorporates discussions and analyses of market risk embedded in off balance sheet activities as well as on non interest income items such as loan sale premiums 
alco actively monitors the impact of related market risk since these premiums are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
provident financial group  inc 
and subsidiaries all transaction accounts are regularly analyzed for embedded market risk 
these accounts are evaluated with respect to their repricing characteristics as well as their expected average lives 
provident offers a diverse set of managed transaction accounts including some that reprice according to a third party index and some with managed rates 
alco actively monitors the behavioral characteristics of these products 
although indexed account rates move parallel to movements in short term rates  managed account rates adjust slower and at smaller increments due to the competitive environment 
during the current low rate environment  such price rigidities negatively impact interest rate margins in the short run  however  the long term profitability and liquidity characteristics of these accounts are very attractive
