item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k contains certain statements of a forward looking nature relating to future events or the future financial performance of the company 
such statements are only predictions and the actual events or results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below as well as those discussed in other filings made by the company with the securities and exchange commission 
overview since our inception in  we have been engaged in research and development activities and organizational efforts  including identification and licensing of enzyme targets  drug discovery  structure based design of drug candidates  small scale synthesis of compounds  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials  recruiting our scientific and management personnel  establishing laboratory facilities  and raising capital 
our revenues have generally been limited to license fees  milestone payments  interest income  and collaboration research and development fees 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
research and development revenue on cost reimbursement agreements is recognized as expenses are incurred  up to contractual limits 
research and development fees  license fees and milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete  the company has no further continuing performance obligations and has completed its performance under the terms of the agreement  in accordance with sab license fees and milestone payments received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and taken into income as earned over the estimated drug development period 
the company has not received any royalties from the sale of licensed pharmaceutical products 
it could be several years  if ever  before we will recognize significant revenue from royalties received pursuant to our license agreements  and we are not likely to ever generate revenue directly from product sales 
future revenues  if any  are likely to fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
our accumulated deficit at december  was million 
we will require substantial expenditures relating to the development of our current and future drug candidates 
during the three years ended december   we spent of our research and development expenses on contract research and development  including payments to consultants  funding of research at academic institutions  large scale synthesis of compounds  preclinical studies  engaging investigators to conduct clinical trials  hiring contract research organizations to monitor and gather data on clinical trials  and using statisticians to evaluate the results of clinical trials 
the above expenditures for contract research and development for our current and future drug candidates will vary from quarter to quarter depending on the status of our research and development projects 
for example  on june   we announced preliminary phase iii clinical trial data for peramivir  our investigational oral influenza neuraminidase inhibitor 
the trial indicated no statistically significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint between groups treated with peramivir and groups treated with placebo 
based on these data  we discontinued the development of peramivir 
during the first nine months of  our cash expenses related to this trial were approximately million 
after terminating the development of peramivir  the company streamlined its operations  reducing its workforce from employees to employees in order to conserve its resources and provide a longer timeframe in which to advance its other programs 
changes in our existing and future research and development and collaborative relationships will also impact the status of our research and development projects 
although we may  in some cases  be able to control the timing of development expenses  in part by accelerating or decelerating certain of these costs  many of these costs will be incurred irrespective of whether or not we are able to discover drug candidates or obtain collaborative partners for commercialization 
as a result  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
if we fail to meet the research  clinical and financial expectations of securities analysts and investors  it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue decreased to in from  in  primarily due to a change in accounting estimate following ortho mcneil and rwjpri s notice of termination of the worldwide license agreement with us to develop and market products to treat and prevent viral influenza 
as a result of this termination  we recognized all remaining deferred revenues and expenses related to this agreement during the second and third quarters of interest and other income decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a reduction in cash from the funding of operations and a lower interest rate environment in research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in expenses is primarily attributable to the clinical trial expenses incurred to complete a phase iii trial for peramivir  prior to the termination of this program in june  plus animal studies related to peramivir and our other programs 
general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in the increase is primarily due to an increase in expenses related to the adoption of a stockholder rights plan  insurance and other professional fees 
royalty expense decreased to in from  in this decrease is directly attributable to the change in accounting estimate resulting from the termination of our worldwide license agreement by ortho mcneil and rwjpri for our neuraminidase inhibitor  peramivir 
as a result of the termination of this program effective june   we also recorded a non cash impairment loss of  in related to the influenza patents 
there were no impairment charges recorded in year ended december  compared with the year ended december  collaborative and other research and development revenue increased to  in from  in  primarily due to a change in accounting estimate following ortho mcneil and rwjpri s notice of termination of the worldwide license agreement with us to develop and market products to treat and prevent viral influenza 
as a result of this termination  we recognized all remaining deferred revenues and expenses related to this agreement during the second and third quarters of the deferred revenues from this agreement had been recorded as a result of the implementation of sab in the first quarter of interest and other income decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to a reduction in cash from the expansion of our facilities and the funding of operations 
research and development expenses increased to  in from  in the increase in expenses is primarily attributable to increased facilities expenses resulting from the expansion of our facilities during and the related increases in personnel during and  plus the additional clinical trial expenses associated with the continuing phase iii development of peramivir 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  in from  in the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in stockholder expenses and the reduced alabama share tax assessment in royalty expense increased to  in from  in this increase is directly attributable to the change in accounting estimate resulting from the termination of our worldwide license agreement by ortho mcneil and rwjpri for our neuraminidase inhibitor  peramivir 
liquidity and capital resources cash expenditures have exceeded revenues since the company s inception 
our operations have principally been funded through various sources  including the following public offerings and private placements of equity and debt securities  equipment lease financing  facility leases  collaborative and other research and development agreements including licenses and options for licenses  research grants and interest income 
in addition  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with other parties to conduct certain research and development and using consultants 
we expect to incur additional expenses  potentially resulting in significant losses  as we continue to pursue our research and development activities and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of compounds  which have been or may be discovered 
we also expect to incur substantial expenses related to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
on june   the company announced we were discontinuing the development of peramivir  our investigational oral influenza neuraminidase inhibitor designed to treat and prevent influenza 
after terminating the development of peramivir  the company streamlined its operations in order to conserve its resources and provide a longer timeframe in which to advance its other programs 
on august   at the request of the compensation committee  our board of directors approved a reduction in salary by for both dr 
charles e 
bugg  our chairman and chief executive officer and dr 
j 
claude bennett  our president  chief operating officer and medical director  effective august  in the event of any change of control of the company  any cumulative salary reductions up to the date of the change of control would become due and payable to them 
the monthly amount of the reduction was  combined 
this arrangement has not been documented in any formal written agreement 
the company invests its excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limits the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
these investments are generally not collateralized and mature within three years 
the company has not realized any losses from such investments 
in addition  at december   approximately million was invested in the merrill lynch premier institutional fund  which invests primarily in commercial paper  us government and agency bills and notes  corporate notes  certificates of deposit and time deposits 
the merrill lynch premier institutional fund is not insured 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and securities held to maturity were million  a decrease of million from december   principally due to the funding of current operations  which included the phase iii development of peramivir  a program that was terminated in june we have financed some of our equipment purchases with lease lines of credit 
we currently have a  general line of credit with our bank  secured by a pledge of  in marketable securities 
there was nothing drawn against this line as of december  in july  we renegotiated our lease for our current facilities  which will expire on june  we have an option to renew the lease for an additional five years at the current market rate in effect on june  and a one time option to terminate the lease on june  for a reasonable termination fee 
the lease  as amended effective july  for an additional  square feet  requires us to pay monthly rent starting at  per month in july and escalating annually to a minimum of  per month in the final year  plus our pro rata share of operating expenses and real estate taxes in excess of base year amounts 
as part of the lease  we have deposited a us treasury security in escrow for the payment of rent and performance of other obligations specified in the lease 
this pledged amount is currently  which will be decreased by  annually throughout the term of the lease 
during  we renovated our facilities to gain additional laboratory space  update our existing laboratories  and add a small good manufacturing practices gmp clean room 
in addition  we updated our general office facility to provide for growth and efficiencies 
the total cost of these changes  including furniture and laboratory equipment  was approximately million 
this phase of renovation was completed in december another phase of renovation was completed in february for approximately million to add two chemistry laboratories and purchase additional equipment 
currently  there are no plans for additional renovations 
as a result of the reduction in our staff during july  we now have approximately  square feet of excess space we are currently attempting to sublease 
at december   we had long term operating lease obligations  which provide for aggregate minimum payments of  in   in and  in these obligations include the future rental of our operating facility 
we plan to finance our needs principally from the following our existing capital resources and interest earned on that capital  payments under collaborative and licensing agreements with corporate partners  and through lease or loan financing and future public or private financing 
we believe that our available funds will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through however  this is a forward looking statement  and there may be changes that would consume available resources significantly before such time 
our long term capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend upon many factors  including the progress of our research  drug discovery and development programs  changes in existing collaborative relationships  our ability to establish additional collaborative relationships  the magnitude of our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to identify drug candidates  competitive and technological advances  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  our dependence on others for development and commercialization of our product candidates  and successful commercialization of our products consistent with our licensing strategy 
additional funding  whether through additional sales of securities or collaborative or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources  may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities  with terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to transfer certain material rights to such corporate partners 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate certain of our research and development programs 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which were utilized in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
research and development revenue on cost reimbursement agreements is recognized as expenses are incurred  up to contractual limits 
research and development fees  license fees and milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the earnings process is complete  the company has no further continuing performance obligations and has completed its performance under the terms of the agreement  in accordance with sab license fees and milestone payments received under licensing agreements that are related to future performance are deferred and taken into income as earned over the estimated drug development period 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as these contracts or agreements progress to completion 
revisions to revenue or profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision became known 
valuation of financial instruments we carry our held to maturity securities at amortized cost  as adjusted for other than temporary declines in market value 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the market conditions and other key measures for our held to maturity investments 
future adverse changes in market conditions could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the held to maturity investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred taxes we have not had taxable income since incorporation and  therefore  we have not paid any income tax 
we have deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and research and development carryforwards  and have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
patents and licenses patents and licenses are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or years  whichever is lesser 
these costs are reviewed periodically in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement no 
to determine any impairment that needs to be recognized 
certain risk factors that may affect future results  financial condition and the market price of securities we have incurred substantial losses since our inception in  expect to continue to incur such losses  may never be profitable and may need additional financing since our inception in  we have not been profitable 
we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future  and our losses could increase as our research and development efforts progress 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
to become profitable  we must successfully develop drug candidates  enter into profitable agreements with other parties and our drug candidates must receive regulatory approval 
these other parties must then successfully manufacture and market our drug candidates 
it could be several years  if ever  before we receive royalties from any future license agreements 
in addition  we are not likely to generate revenue directly from product sales 
if we do not generate revenue  or if our drug development expenses increase  we may need to raise additional funds through new or existing collaborations or through private or public equity or debt financing 
if financing is not available on acceptable terms or not available at all  we may not have enough capital to continue our current business strategy 
our future revenue generation is uncertain our revenue from collaborative agreements is dependent upon the status of our preclinical and clinical programs 
if we fail to advance these programs to the point of being able to enter into successful collaborations  we will not receive any future milestone or other collaborative payments 
if our development collaborations with other parties fail  the development of our drug candidates will be delayed or stopped we rely completely upon other parties for many important stages of our drug development programs  including discovery of proteins that cause or enable biological reactions necessary for the progression of the disease or disorder  called enzyme targets  execution of some preclinical studies and late stage development for our compounds and drug candidates management of our regulatory function  and manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution of our drug candidates 
our failure to engage in successful collaborations at any one of these stages would greatly impact our business 
if we do not license enzyme targets from academic institutions or from other biotechnology companies on acceptable terms  our product development efforts would suffer 
similarly  if the contract research organizations that conduct our initial or late stage clinical trials or manage our regulatory function breached their obligations to us  this would delay or prevent the development of our drug candidates 
even more critical to our success is our ability to enter into successful collaborations for the late stage clinical development  regulatory approval  manufacturing  marketing  sales and distribution of our drug candidates 
our strategy is to rely upon other parties for all of these steps so that we can focus exclusively on the key areas of our expertise 
this heavy reliance upon third parties for these critical functions presents several risks  including these contracts may expire or the other parties to the contract may terminate them  our partners may choose to pursue alternative technologies  including those of our competitors  we may have disputes with a partner that could lead to litigation or arbitration  our partners may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our drug candidates  and our partners may not comply with applicable government regulatory requirements 
any problems encountered with our current or future partners could delay or prevent the development of our compounds  which would severely affect our business  because if our compounds do not reach the market in a timely manner  or at all  we may never receive any milestone or royalty payments 
if the clinical trials of our drug candidates fail  our drug candidates will not be marketed  which would result in a complete absence of product related revenue to receive the regulatory approvals necessary for the sale of our drug candidates  we or our licensees must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that each drug candidate is safe and effective 
if we or our licensees are unable to demonstrate that our drug candidates are safe and effective  our drug candidates will not receive regulatory approval and will not be marketed  which would result in a complete absence of product related revenue 
the clinical trial process is complex and uncertain 
because of the cost and duration of clinical trials  we may decide to discontinue development of product candidates that are either unlikely to show good results in the trials or unlikely to help advance a product to the point of a meaningful collaboration 
positive results from preclinical studies and early clinical trials do not ensure positive results in clinical trials designed to permit application for regulatory approval  called pivotal clinical trials 
we may suffer significant setbacks in pivotal clinical trials  even after earlier clinical trials show promising results 
any of our drug candidates may produce undesirable side effects in humans 
these side effects could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a drug candidate 
these side effects could also result in the fda or foreign regulatory authorities refusing to approve the drug candidate for any targeted indications 
we  our licensees  the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if we or they believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
clinical trials may fail to demonstrate that our drug candidates are safe or effective 
clinical trials are lengthy and expensive 
we or our licensees incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  preclinical testing and clinical trials  yet cannot be certain that the tests and trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
for example  clinical trials require adequate supplies of drug and sufficient patient enrollment 
delays in patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times 
even if we or our licensees successfully complete clinical trials for our product candidates  our licensees might not file the required regulatory submissions in a timely manner and may not receive regulatory approval for the drug candidate 
if we or our licensees do not obtain and maintain governmental approvals for our products under development  we or our partners will not be able to sell these potential products  which would significantly harm our business because we will receive no revenue we or our licensees must obtain regulatory approval before marketing or selling our future drug products 
if we or our licensees are unable to receive regulatory approval and do not market or sell our future drug products  we will never receive any revenue from such product sales 
in the united states  we or our partners must obtain fda approval for each drug that we intend to commercialize 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
products distributed abroad are also subject to foreign government regulation 
the fda or foreign regulatory agencies have not approved any of our drug candidates 
if we or our licensees fail to obtain regulatory approval we will be unable to market and sell our future drug products 
we have several drug products in various stages of preclinical and clinical development  however  we are unable to determine when  if ever  any of these products will be commercially available 
because of the risks and uncertainties in biopharmaceutical development  our drug candidates could take a significantly longer time to gain regulatory approval than we expect or may never gain approval 
if the fda delays regulatory approval of our drug candidates  our management s credibility  our company s value and our operating results may suffer 
even if the fda or foreign regulatory agencies approve a drug candidate  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a drug candidate and or may require post marketing studies 
the fda regulates  among other things  the record keeping and storage of data pertaining to potential pharmaceutical products 
we currently store most of our preclinical research data at our facility 
while we do store duplicate copies of most of our clinical data offsite  we could lose important preclinical data if our facility incurs damage 
if we get approval to market our potential products  whether in the united states or internationally  we will continue to be subject to extensive regulatory requirements 
these requirements are wide ranging and govern  among other things adverse drug experience reporting regulations  product promotion  product manufacturing  including good manufacturing practice requirements  and product changes or modifications 
our failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements  or our loss of  or changes to  previously obtained approvals  could have a material adverse effect on our business because we will not receive royalty revenues if our licensees do not receive approval of our products for marketing in june  we notified the fda that we submitted incorrect data for our phase ii studies of bcx applied to the skin for cutaneous t cell lymphoma and psoriasis 
the fda inspected us in november and issued us a list of inspectional observations  form fda  which cited our failure to follow good clinical practices 
the fda also inspected us in june the focus was on the two phase ii dose ranging studies of topical bcx for the treatment of cutaneous t cell lymphoma and psoriasis 
as a result of the investigation  the fda issued us a form fda  which cited our failure to follow good clinical practices 
biocryst is no longer developing bcx  however  as a consequence of these two investigations  our ongoing and future clinical studies may receive increased scrutiny  which may delay the regulatory review process 
if our drug candidates do not achieve broad market acceptance  our business may never become profitable our drug candidates may not gain the market acceptance required for us to be profitable even if they successfully complete initial and final clinical trials and receive approval for sale by the fda or foreign regulatory agencies 
the degree of market acceptance of any drug candidates that we or our partners develop will depend on a number of factors  including cost effectiveness of our drug candidates  their safety and effectiveness relative to alternative treatments  reimbursement policies of government and third party payers  and marketing and distribution support for our drug candidates 
physicians  patients  payers or the medical community in general may not accept or use our drug candidates even after the fda or foreign regulatory agencies approve the drug candidates 
if our drug candidates do not achieve significant market acceptance  we will not have enough revenues to become profitable 
if competitive products from other companies are better than our product candidates  our future revenues might fail to meet expectations the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
other products and therapies that either currently exist on the market or are under development could compete directly with some of the compounds that we are seeking to develop and market 
these other products may render some or all of our compounds under development noncompetitive or obsolete 
products marketed by our competitors may prove to be more effective than our own  and our products  if any  may not offer an economically feasible or preferable alternative to existing therapies 
if we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others  the value of those rights would diminish our success will depend in part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain patent protection for our products  methods  processes and other technologies to preserve our trade secrets  and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
if we or our partners are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights for our products  methods  processes and other technologies  the value of the drug candidates that we license to derive revenue would diminish 
additionally  if our products  methods  processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties  we could incur substantial costs 
the us patent and trademark office has issued to us a number of us patents for our various inventions and we have in licensed several patents from various institutions 
we have filed additional patent applications and provisional patent applications with the us patent and trademark office 
we have filed a number of corresponding foreign patent applications and intend to file additional foreign and us patent applications  as appropriate 
we cannot assure you as to the degree and range of protection any patents will afford against competitors with similar products  if and when patents will issue  or whether or not others will obtain patents claiming aspects similar to those covered by our patent applications 
if the us patent and trademark office upholds patents issued to others or if the us patent and trademark office grants patent applications filed by others  we may have to obtain licenses or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement  stop using the subject matter claimed in those patents  or pay damages 
we may initiate  or others may bring against us  litigation or administrative proceedings related to intellectual property rights  including proceedings before the us patent and trademark office 
any judgment adverse to us in any litigation or other proceeding arising in connection with a patent or patent application could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the costs of any such proceeding may be substantial whether or not we are successful 
our success is also dependent upon the skills  knowledge and experience  none of which is patentable  of our scientific and technical personnel 
to help protect our rights  we require all employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of our company and require disclosure and assignment to us of their ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions 
these agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information  and if any of our proprietary information is disclosed  our business will suffer because our revenues depend upon our ability to license our technology and any such events would significantly impair the value of such a license 
if we fail to retain our existing key personnel or fail to attract and retain additional key personnel  the development of our drug candidates and the expansion of our business will be delayed or stopped we are highly dependent upon our senior management and scientific team  the loss of whose services might impede the achievement of our development and commercial objectives 
competition for key personnel with the experience that we require is intense and is expected to continue to increase 
our inability to attract and retain the required number of skilled and experienced management  operational and scientific personnel  will harm our business because we rely upon these personnel for many critical functions of our business 
in addition  we rely on members of our scientific advisory board and consultants to assist us in formulating our research and development strategy 
all of the members of the scientific advisory board and all of our consultants are otherwise employed and each such member or consultant may have commitments to other entities that may limit their availability to us 
if users of our drug products are not reimbursed for use  future sales of our drug products will decline the lack of reimbursement for the use of our product candidates by hospitals  clinics  patients or doctors will harm our business 
medicare  medicaid  health maintenance organizations and other third party payers may not authorize or otherwise budget for the reimbursement of our products 
governmental and third party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
we cannot be sure that third party payers would view our product candidates as cost effective  that reimbursement will be available to consumers or that reimbursement will be sufficient to allow our product candidates to be marketed on a competitive basis 
changes in reimbursement policies  or attempts to contain costs in the health care industry  limit or restrict reimbursement for our product candidates  would materially and adversely affect our business  because future product sales would decline and we would receive less royalty revenue 
if we face clinical trial liability claims related to the use or misuse of our compounds in clinical trials  our management s time will be diverted and we will incur litigation costs we face an inherent business risk of liability claims in the event that the use or misuse of our compounds results in personal injury or death 
we have not experienced any clinical trial liability claims to date  but we may experience these claims in the future 
after commercial introduction of our products we may experience losses due to product liability claims 
we currently maintain clinical trial liability insurance coverage in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate  with an additional million potentially available under our umbrella policy 
the insurance policy may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us 
clinical trial liability insurance may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
any claims against us  regardless of their merit  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  because litigation related to these claims would strain our financial resources in addition to consuming the time and attention of our management 
if our computer systems fail  our business will suffer our drug development activities depend on the security  integrity and performance of the computer systems supporting them  and the failure of our computer systems could delay our drug development efforts 
we currently store most of our preclinical and clinical data at our facility 
duplicate copies of all critical data are stored off site in a bank vault 
any significant degradation or failure of our computer systems could cause us to inaccurately calculate or lose our data 
loss of data could result in significant delays in our drug development process and any system failure could harm our business and operations 
if  because of our use of hazardous materials  we violate any environmental controls or regulations that apply to such materials  we may incur substantial costs and expenses in our remediation efforts our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and some waste products 
accidental contamination or injury from these materials could occur 
in the event of an accident  we could be liable for any damages that result and any liabilities could exceed our resources 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations could require us to incur substantial unexpected costs  which would materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
because stock ownership is concentrated  you and other investors will have minimal influence on stockholder decisions as of december   our directors  executive officers and some principal stockholders and their affiliates  including johnson johnson development corporation  beneficially owned approximately directors and officers own of our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents 
as a result  these holders  if acting together  are able to significantly influence matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors 
this concentration of ownership may delay  defer or prevent a change in our control 
we have anti takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents that may result in outcomes with which you do not agree our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of undesignated preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors and supermajority approval of the removal of any member of the board of directors and prevents our stockholders from acting by written consent 
our certificate also requires supermajority approval of any amendment of these provisions 
these provisions and other provisions of our by laws and of delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
in june  our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan and  pursuant thereto  issued preferred stock purchase rights rights to the holders of our common stock 
the rights have certain anti takeover effects 
if triggered  the rights would cause substantial dilution to a person or group of persons who acquires more than for william w 
featheringill  a director who already owns more than of our common stock on terms not approved by the board of directors 
our stock price is likely to be highly volatile and the value of your investment could decline significantly the market prices for securities of biotechnology companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
moreover  our stock price has fluctuated frequently  and these fluctuations are often not related to our financial results 
for the twelve months ended december   the week range of the market price of our stock has been from to per share 
the following factors  in addition to other risk factors described in this section  may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  developments or disputes concerning patents or proprietary rights  status of new or existing licensing or collaborative agreements  we or our licensees achieving or failing to achieve development milestones  publicity regarding actual or potential medical results relating to products under development by us our competitors  regulatory developments in both the united states and foreign countries  public concern as to the safety of pharmaceutical products  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  economic and other external factors or other disasters or crises  and period to period fluctuations in our financial results 
we may be unable to maintain the standards for listing on the nasdaq national market  which could adversely affect the value and possibly the liquidity of our common stock our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq national market national market 
nasdaq requires listed companies to maintain standards for continued listing  including a minimum bid price for shares of a company s stock 
if we are unable to maintain these standards  we may have to request a transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market smallcap market and could eventually be delisted 
on january   we received notice from the national market that our common stock had closed for more than consecutive trading days below the minimum per share requirement for continued inclusion on the national market under marketplace rule a 
on march   we were notified by the national market that we had regained compliance 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with the nasdaq national market listing standards 
if we fail to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the national market  but meet the requirements of the smallcap market  we could request a transfer to the smallcap market 
this would provide an extended period to regain compliance and be listed again on the national market 
failure to maintain the continued listing standards of the smallcap market would result in a delisting  which could adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock and could subject our common stock to the penny stock rules 
a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
we invest excess cash principally in us marketable securities from a diversified portfolio of institutions with strong credit ratings and in us government and agency bills and notes  and by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure at any one institution 
some of the securities we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we schedule our investments to have maturities that coincide with our cash flow needs  thus avoiding the need to redeem an investment prior to its maturity date 
accordingly  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided
