item business overview we are a leading provider of haptic technology bringing the sense of feel or touch to large  diversified markets 
we develop  manufacture  license and support a wide range of hardware and software technologies that enable users to interact with a multitude of computing and other devices using their sense of touch 
we manage our business under two operating and reportable segments immersion computing  entertainment  and industrial  and immersion medical 
we focus on four application areas consumer  computing and entertainment  medical simulation  industrial and automotive  and three dimensional and professional products 
in high volume market areas such as consumer computer peripherals and automotive interfaces  we primarily license our touch enabling technologies to third party manufacturers 
for lower volume markets like medical simulation systems and three dimensional and professional products  our primary strategy is to manufacture and sell products through direct sales  distributors and value added resellers 
in all market areas  we also engage in development projects for third parties and government agencies from time to time 
our objective is to proliferate our touchsense technologies across markets  platforms and applications so that touch and feel become as common as color  graphics and sound in modern user interfaces 
immersion and its wholly owned subsidiaries hold more than issued patents and more than pending patent applications worldwide covering various aspects of hardware and software technologies 
industry background early computers had crude user interfaces that only displayed text and numbers 
these machines  commonly known as green screen computers  were effective at processing data but did not communicate information in an engaging and intuitive manner 
as a result  computing was used primarily in selected scientific and business applications 
in the early s  computers began to use graphics and sound to engage users perceptual senses more naturally 
graphics technologies transformed monochrome screens to color  and brought pictures  charts  diagrams and animation to the computer screen 
audio technologies enabled sound and music 
by the late s  graphics and audio technologies had spread to consumer markets  initially through computer gaming applications 
by the early s  the penetration of color graphics and sound into consumer markets had expanded beyond gaming into mainstream productivity applications  largely due to the introduction of the windows graphical user interface 
by the late s  the proliferation of graphics and audio content helped transform the computer into a highly interactive and popular medium for communication  commerce and entertainment 

table of contents while most modern computers realistically present information to the senses of sight and sound  most still lack the ability to convey content through the sense of touch 
the absence of touch is a substantial barrier to making computer use more natural and intuitive 
software designers strive to develop compelling applications for users to see and hear  but do not provide applications that engage users sense of touch 
as a result  software is not as engaging and informative as it would be if tactile sensations were conveyed 
the absence of touch and feel in modern computers also limits user productivity 
the windows interface  for example  is based on a physical metaphor users must move the cursor on a screen to drag  drop  stretch and click 
however  users must manipulate graphical elements without the benefit of tactile feedback 
as a result  using a cursor is visually taxing 
selecting an icon  clicking on a hyperlink or targeting the edge of a window are common tasks that would be easier to perform if users could feel the engagement of their cursor with the intended target 
touch and feel can also be used to enhance a wide variety of applications beyond personal computing 
for example  adding touch to medical simulation equipment allows medical professionals to train  practice and enhance their skills to perform surgical procedures in a way never before possible 
adding touch to automotive controls can help simplify the control of multiple systems within a car by allowing the driver to identify tactilely which system is being controlled 
like sight and sound  touch is critical for interacting with and understanding one s physical surroundings 
technology that brings the sense of touch to computing has the potential to further humanize the computer and increase the ease  usefulness and enjoyment of computing 
haptics the science of touch simulation touch or feel simulation  also known as force feedback  haptic feedback or force reflection  refers to the technique of adding touch sensations to computer hardware and software by imparting physical forces upon the user s hand 
these forces are imparted by actuators  usually motors  which are incorporated into consumer peripheral devices such as mice  joysticks  steering wheels or gamepads  or into more sophisticated interfaces designed for industrial  medical  automotive or scientific applications 
touch enabled peripheral devices can impart to users physical sensations like rough textures  smooth surfaces  viscous liquids  compliant springs  jarring vibrations  heavy masses and rumbling engines 
as a user manipulates a touch enabled device  such as a joystick  motors within the device apply computer modulated forces that resist  assist or otherwise enhance the manipulations 
these forces are generated based on mathematical models that simulate the desired sensations 
for example  when simulating the feel of a rigid wall with a force feedback joystick  motors within the joystick apply forces that simulate the feel of encountering the wall 
as the user moves the joystick to penetrate the wall  the motors apply a force that resists the penetration 
the harder the user pushes  the harder the motors push back 
the end result is a sensation that feels like a physical encounter with an obstacle 
the mathematical models that control the motors may be simple modulating forces based on a function of time  such as jolts and vibrations  or may be more complex modulating forces based on user manipulations such as surfaces  textures  springs and liquids 
complex sensations can be created by combining a number of simpler sensations 
for example  a series of simulated surfaces can be combined to give the seamless feel of a complex object like a sports car 
textures can be added to these complex surfaces so that the windshield of the sports car feels smooth and its tires feel rubbery 
our solution we re changing the way people interact with digital devices of all types  by adding the sense of touch to a digital world 
our technologies engage the sense of touch to give users of our technologies a more complete  intuitive experience

the use of our simulators allows healthcare providers to practice procedures in an environment that poses no risks to patients  where mistakes have no dire consequences and animal or cadaver use is avoided 
we partner with leading medical technology companies  such as medtronic inc medtronic  to develop applications that closely simulate not only the look  but also the feel of performing an actual medical procedure  allowing doctors to safely practice and perfect techniques before they start performing operations on patients 
industrial and automotive 
in recent years there has been a proliferation of automotive sub systems  which are directly accessed by drivers and passengers 
these include radio  cd  navigation  telephone and climate control systems  among others 
as a result  there has been a corresponding increase in the number of physical control devices in the automotive cockpit 
this clutter may be hazardous to the extent it distracts the driver s attention 
our touchsense knob controls multiple systems and has a different feel for each system to allow the driver to identify tactilely which system is being controlled 
the result is a simpler  more accessible control environment 
we have licensed our automotive control knob technology to bmw  which has incorporated the touchsense control knob in its series sedan and we believe will be included in some models of its series sedan 
we are also conducting various funded development efforts and providing 
table of contents tools and evaluation licenses to several other major automobile manufacturers and suppliers who have expressed interest in touch enabled automobile controls 
three dimensional and professional products 
our efforts in this area include computer peripherals that we manufacture and sell and which are targeted at three dimensional computer imaging applications 
these include the microscribe g product line  which allows users to capture three dimensional computer models directly from physical objects 
the microscribe g products contain sensor and microprocessor technologies that allow users to digitize physical objects simply by tracing their contours with a stylus 
third party software records the three dimensional geometry of the object and reproduces it on the screen as a three dimensional computer model 
the microscribe g product line is designed to support the needs of game developers  engineers  animators  filmmakers  industrial designers and other professionals who need to create realistic three dimensional computer images quickly and easily 
another focus of our efforts is our cyberglove  cybergrasp and cyberforce line of gloves and touch enabled interaction hardware  and our virtualhand three dimensional interaction software products  that simulate the manipulation of objects in three dimensional environments 
our cyberglove line of whole hand sensing gloves and three dimensional software products are used in research applications and in high end simulation  mechanical computer aided design  visualization and motion capture applications to improve the product development process 
in addition to these d products  we manufacture and sell specialized computer peripherals that are not touch enabled  but incorporate related advanced computer peripheral technologies 
these specialized peripherals include the softmouse  a high performance  non touch enabled mouse optimized for use in geographic information systems and mapmaking  and pinpoint  a stereotactic arm used to enable image guided biopsies and radiation therapy 
technologies and products technology licensing 
we currently license our intellectual property to manufacturers  which produce peripheral devices incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
in general  our licenses permit manufacturers to produce only a particular category of product within a specified field of use 
our basic licensing model includes an up front license fee and or a per unit royalty paid by the manufacturer that is a percentage of the wholesale selling price of the touch enabled product 
in addition  each licensee must abide by a branding obligation 
the prominent display of the touchsense logo on retail packaging generates customer awareness for our technologies 
consumer  computing and entertainment products 
we license our intellectual property to manufacturers and distributors  which incorporate our touch enabling technologies into various computer peripheral devices  targeted at the pc and game console platforms 
in we expanded our reach in this marketplace by adding support for the apple macintosh os x platform  enabling our licensees to provide force feedback output through gaming software running on the macintosh platform 
currently  there are a number of consumer pc joysticks sold using touchsense technology  including the wingman force d from logitech  the sidewinder force feedback from microsoft  the cyborg d force and st and cyborg d rumble joystick from saitek  the fox pro joystick and top gun afterburner force feedback joystick from thrustmaster  and the destroyer aftershock from gravis

these products are designed to work with one or more video game 
table of contents consoles including the xbox from microsoft  the playstation and playstation from sony  the gamecube  n  and gameboy from nintendo  and the dreamcast from sega 
demand for computer peripheral devices incorporating our touch enabling technologies depends on the existence of software applications and web pages that take advantage of these devices 
the development of such software likewise depends on the existence of an installed base of touch enabled hardware devices 
we have addressed this interdependency of hardware and software solutions in two ways 
first  we have developed end user software that is included with our licensee s touch enabled mice and which automatically adds touch to many of the basic windows  windows  windows me and windows xp controls 
second  we have developed and licensed to developers and end users software authoring tools that help programmers add touch enabled content to software applications and web pages 
medical products 
we have four medical simulation product lines our cathsim vascular access simulator  which simulates intravenous catheterization  our accutouch endoscopy simulator  which simulates endoscopy procedures  our accutouch endovascular simulator  which simulates endovascular interventions  and our laparoscopic simulation hardware that can be integrated with third party software for surgical procedure simulation 
these devices are used for training and educational purposes that enable health professionals to feel simulations of sensations experienced during medical procedures  such as encountering an unexpected obstruction in an artery 
all are comprised of software modules  an interface device and a hardware platform 
we sell hardware systems for between  and  which enable potential additional sales of software to the installed base of hardware systems 
we design each product line to maximize the number of procedures that can be simulated with minimal additional customer investment 
the relatively low price of our software modules provides an opportunity for repeat sales 
we currently have over various software modules available that replicate such medical procedures as intravenous catheterization  peripherally inserted central catheters picc  bronchoscopy  colonoscopy  cardiac pacing modules  and coronary angioplasty 
medtronic  a leading medical device company  accounts for a large portion of our medical simulation product revenues as well as development contract revenues and a reduction in sales to medtronic  a reduction in development work  or a decision not to renew existing licenses by medtronic may reduce our total revenue 
for the year ended december  medtronic accounted for of our total revenues 
industrial and automotive controls 
we have developed touchsense technology appropriate for use in automobile dashboards 
we have begun efforts to license this technology to automobile manufacturers and automobile component suppliers 
bmw was the first automobile manufacturer to license our touchsense knob technology for use in the dashboard controls of its series sedan model

our software support staff also works closely with developers to assist them in developing compelling touch enabled applications 

table of contents we believe that it is important to increase awareness of our touch enabling technology among potential end users 
to this end  we have engaged in a series of public relations  marketing and promotional campaigns 
the goal of these efforts is to create consumer awareness of the benefits of touch enabling technologies 
our sales and marketing expenses were million in  million in  and million in the decrease from to was mainly due to reduced expenses related to advertising  application and market development funds  and a reduction in expenses due to decreased headcount  employee salary reductions  and corresponding employee benefits 
research and development our success depends on our ability to improve  and reduce the costs of  our technologies in a timely manner 
we have assembled a team of highly skilled engineers who possess experience in the disciplines required for touch enabling technology development  including mechanical engineering  electrical engineering  computer science and medical doctors 
our research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in our research and development efforts have been focused on technology development  including hardware  software and designs 
we have entered into numerous contracts with government agencies and corporations that help fund advanced research and development 
our government contracts permit us to retain ownership of the technology developed under the contracts  provided that we provide the applicable government agency a license to use the technology for non commercial purposes 
competition with respect to touch enabled consumer products  we are aware of several companies that claim to possess force feedback technology applicable to the consumer market  but we are not aware that any of these companies or their licensees have introduced touch enabled products 
in addition  we are aware of several companies that currently market unlicensed force feedback products in the consumer markets 
we are engaged in litigation with two of these companies  sony and microsoft  over infringement of our patents 
several companies also currently market force feedback products to non consumer markets and could shift their focus to the consumer market 
in addition  our licensees may develop products that compete with products employing our touch enabling technology but are based on alternative technologies or develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technologies  duplicate our technologies or design around our patents 
many of our licensees  including microsoft and logitech  and other potential competitors have greater financial and technical resources upon which to draw in attempting to develop computer peripheral technologies that do not make use of our touch enabling technology 
our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property rights for any reason could hurt our competitive position 
there is no guarantee that patents may issue from the patent applications that we have filed or may file 
our issued patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and claims of our patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or issued in the proper geographic regions  to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage 
our competitive position is partially dependent on the competitive positions of our licensees that pay a per unit royalty 
our licensees markets are highly competitive 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our licensees markets include price  performance  user centric design  ease of use  quality and timeliness of products  as well as the manufacturer s responsiveness  capacity  technical abilities  established customer relationships  retail shelf space  advertising  promotion programs and brand recognition 
touch related benefits in such markets may be viewed simply as enhancements and compete with non touch enabled technologies 
there are several companies that currently sell high end simulation products that compete with our medical products  including simbionix 
the principal bases for competition in these markets are technological sophistication and price 
we believe we compete favorably on these bases 
with respect to our whole hand sensing gloves  fifth dimension technologies is our primary competitor 
higher accuracy higher cost 
table of contents coordinate measuring machines cmm s from faro technologies and romer cimcore remain the primary competitors to microscribe g intellectual property we believe that intellectual property protection is crucial to our business

factors that may affect future results we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december   have a history of losses  will experience losses in the future and may not achieve or maintain profitability 
since  we have incurred losses in every fiscal quarter 
we will need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
we anticipate that our expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we protect and enforce our intellectual property  including the costs of our litigation against sony and microsoft  continue to develop our technologies  attempt to expand the market for touch enabled products  
table of contents increase our sales efforts  and pursue strategic relationships 
if our revenues grow more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations  we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
our current litigation against microsoft and sony is expensive  disruptive and time consuming and will continue to be  and if we are not successful  could adversely affect our business 
on february   we filed a complaint against microsoft corporation  sony computer entertainment  inc  and sony computer entertainment of america  inc in the us district court for the northern district court of california alleging infringement of us patent nos 
 and  the case was assigned to united states district judge claudia wilken 
on april   sony computer entertainment and microsoft answered the complaint by denying the material allegations and alleging counterclaims seeking a judicial declaration that the asserted patents were invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
the process of discovery and exchanging information and documents on infringement  invalidity  and claim construction  is underway 
on october   we filed an amended complaint  withdrawing the claim under the patent and adding a claim of infringement of a new patent  us patent no 
 on october   the court entered an amended case management order that sets  among other dates in the case  april  for a hearing to construe the claims of the asserted patents and april  for the start of trial 
on october   sony computer entertainment and microsoft answered the amended complaint and alleged similar counterclaims for declaratory relief that the asserted patents are invalid  unenforceable  or not infringed 
on march   sony computer entertainment filed a motion for summary judgement of non infringement 
due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation  we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of the litigation 
we anticipate that the litigation will be costly  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover the costs we incur in connection with the litigation 
the litigation has diverted  and is likely to continue to divert  the efforts and attention of some of our key management and personnel 
as a result  until such time as it is resolved  the litigation could adversely affect our business 
further  any unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business 
we may elect to raise additional capital in the future which may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
should any unanticipated circumstances arise which significantly increase our cash or capital requirements we may elect to raise additional capital over the next twelve months to have a supply of cash for such events or future periods 
our plans to raise additional capital may include possible customer prepayments of certain royalty obligations in exchange for a royalty discount and or other negotiated concessions  entering into new license agreements which require up front license payments  and potentially through debt or equity financing 
we have taken measures to control our costs and will continue to monitor these efforts 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
changes in equity markets over the past two years have adversely affected the ability of companies to raise equity financing and have adversely affected the markets for financing for companies with a history of losses such as ours 
additional financing may require us to issue additional shares of our common or preferred stock such that our existing stockholders may experience substantial dilution 
the market for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products is at an early stage and if market demand does not develop  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
the market for our touch enabling technologies  and our licensees touch enabled products is at an early stage 
if we and our licensees are unable to develop demand for touch enabling technologies and touch enabled products  we may not achieve or sustain revenue growth 
we cannot accurately predict the growth of the markets for these technologies and products  the timing of product introductions or the timing of 
table of contents commercial acceptance of these products 
we are currently working to increase the demand for these technologies and products in the following five principal application areas touch enabled medical simulators that can be used for training and skills assessment for procedures such as catheterization  bronchoscopy  colonoscopy  sigmoidoscopy and laparoscopic procedures  touch enabled peripherals for computer gaming on personal computers and dedicated gaming consoles  touch enabled automotive interfaces  touch enabled  whole hand sensing gloves  such as our cyberforce product  and cursor control peripherals  such as touch enabled mice and trackballs  for use with personal computers 
even if our touch enabling technologies and our licensees touch enabled products are ultimately widely adopted  widespread adoption may take a long time to occur 
the timing and amount of royalties and product sales that we receive will depend on whether the products marketed achieve widespread adoption and  if so  how rapidly that adoption occurs 
we expect that we will need to pursue extensive and expensive marketing and sales efforts to educate prospective licensees and end users about the uses and benefits of our technologies and to persuade software developers to create software that utilizes our technologies 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are volatile  and if our future results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
our revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control and any of which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
these factors include the establishment or loss of licensing relationships  the timing of payments under fixed and or up front license agreements  the timing of our expenses  including costs related to litigation  acquisitions of technologies or businesses  the timing of introductions of new products and product enhancements by us  our licensees or their competitors  our ability to develop and improve our technologies  our ability to attract  integrate and retain qualified personnel  and seasonality in the demand for our licensees products 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
in addition  because a high percentage of our operating expenses are fixed  a shortfall of revenues can cause significant variations in operating results from period to period 
if we are unable to enter into new licensing arrangements with our existing licensees and with additional third party manufacturers for our touch enabling technology  our royalty revenue may not grow 
our revenue growth is significantly dependent on our ability to enter into new licensing arrangements 
our failure to enter into new licensing arrangements will cause our operating results to suffer 
we face numerous risks in obtaining new licenses on terms consistent with our business objectives and in maintaining  expanding and supporting our relationships with our current licensees 
these risks include the lengthy and expensive process of building a relationship with potential licensees  the fact that we may compete with the internal design teams of existing and potential licensees  
table of contents difficulties in persuading consumer product manufacturers to work with us  to rely on us for critical technology and to disclose to us proprietary product development and other strategies  and difficulties in persuading existing and potential licensees to bear the development costs necessary to incorporate our technologies into their products 
a substantial majority of our royalty revenue has been derived from the licensing of our portfolio of touch enabling technologies for personal computer gaming peripherals  such as joysticks and steering wheels 
the market for joysticks and steering wheels for use with personal computers is a substantially smaller market than either the mouse market or the dedicated gaming console market and is characterized by declining average selling prices 
if we are unable to gain market acceptance beyond the personal computer gaming peripherals market  we may not achieve royalty revenue growth 
our relationship with medtronic  a leading medical device company  may interfere with our ability to enter into development and licensing relationships with medtronic s competitors 
in february  we entered into an agreement with medtronic  a leading medical device company  in which medtronic was granted a right of first negotiation 
the right of first negotiation applies to any agreement proposed agreement under which we would grant a third party  rights to use specified immersion intellectual property in specified fields of use 
under the terms of the right of first negotiation  we must notify medtronic if we have received a written offer from a third party to enter into a proposed agreement  or if we are seeking to find a third party to enter into a proposed agreement 
medtronic has the exclusive right  for a period of forty days  to negotiate with us regarding the material terms of the proposed agreement 
if during such forty day period  medtronic and immersion fail to reach agreement in principle upon the material terms of the proposed agreement  then we will have twelve months after the expiration of such forty day period to enter into an agreement with the applicable third party  provided that the terms of such agreement are in the aggregate more favorable to immersion than the offer presented by medtronic or the terms under which we initially sought to find a third party to enter into the proposed agreement 
the right of first negotiation ceases to apply to any proposed agreement for which medtronic and immersion reach agreement in principle upon the material terms during the applicable forty day period  but thereafter do not execute a definitive agreement within days after the expiration of such forty day period 
in addition  medtronic s right of first negotiation terminates upon the second anniversary of the completion of a development project to be undertaken by us for medtronic 
although the right of first negotiation has not impeded our ability to interest other medical device companies in our technologies to date  this right of first negotiation or our relationship with medtronic may impede  restrict or delay our ability to enter into development or license agreements with large medical device companies that compete with medtronic 
any restriction in our ability to enter into development or license agreements with other medical device companies would adversely affect our revenues 
medtronic accounts for a large portion of our revenues and a reduction in sales to medtronic  a reduction in development work  or a decision not to renew existing licenses by medtronic may reduce our total revenue 
for the years ended december   and we derived from medtronic  and respectively  of our net revenues 
if our product sales to medtronic decline  and or medtronic reduces the development activities we perform then our total revenues may decline 
logitech accounts for a large portion of our royalty revenue and the failure of logitech to achieve sales volumes for its gaming and cursor control peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies may reduce our royalty revenue 
for the years ended december   and we derived from logitech  and respectively  of our net revenues and  and  respectively of our royalty and license revenue 
we expect that a significant portion of our total revenues will continue to be derived from logitech 
if logitech fails to achieve anticipated sales volumes for its computer peripheral products that incorporate our technologies  our royalty revenue would be reduced 

table of contents the recent slowdown in personal computer sales may lead to a reduction in sales of our licensees touch enabled peripheral products  such as touch enabled mice and joysticks  which may adversely affect our royalty revenue 
over the past year  large personal computer manufacturers have announced slower than anticipated sales of personal computers 
this slowdown in personal computer sales may adversely affect sales of our licensees royalty bearing  touch enabled peripheral products  such as touch enabled mice and joysticks  that are used with personal computers 
the slowdown affecting personal computer companies may also make it more difficult to persuade such manufacturers to incorporate more costly touch enabled mice products into their product lines 
the impact of this downturn on our royalty revenue may be more pronounced if a significant cause of this trend is a reduction in the amount that individuals and companies have budgeted for personal computer related devices  such as touch enabled mice  rather than saturation of the market for personal computers generally 
as a result  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we may be unable to increase sales of our medical simulation devices if  as a result of the current economic slowdown or other factors  medical institutions do not budget for such devices 
our medical simulation products  such as our accutouch endoscopy simulator  the accutouch endovascular simulator and our laparoscopic surgical workstation  have only recently begun to be used by hospitals and medical schools to train healthcare professionals 
as a result  many of these medical institutions do not budget for such simulation devices 
to increase sales of our simulation devices  we must  in addition to convincing medical institution personnel of the utility of the devices  persuade them to include a significant expenditure for the devices in their budgets 
if these medical institutions are unwilling to budget for simulation devices or reduce their budgets as a result of the economic slowdown  cost containment pressures or other factors  we may not be able to increase sales of medical simulators at a satisfactory rate 
as a result of the terrorist attacks against the united states on september  and the continuing threat of terrorist acts  hospitals may have assigned priority in their capital expenditure budgets to equipment that will enable them to respond more effectively to catastrophic emergencies  and federal  state and local governments may have delayed certain funding for medical and educational institutions  in which case purchases of medical simulators may have been deferred 
if we are unable to increase sales of our medical simulation products  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we believe that medical device companies may also decrease their expenditures in corporate research and development budgets and this may adversely affect our contract and development revenue generated by the medical segment 
we do not control or influence our licensees manufacturing  promotion  distribution or pricing of their products incorporating our touch enabling technologies  upon which we are dependent to generate royalty revenue 
a key part of our business strategy is to license our intellectual property to companies that manufacture and sell products incorporating our touch enabling technologies 
sales of those products generate royalty and license revenue for us 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  and of our total revenues were royalty and license revenues 
however  we do not control or influence the manufacture  quality control  promotion  distribution or pricing of products that are manufactured and sold by our licensees 
in addition  we generally do not have commitments from our licensees that they will continue to use our technology in future products 
as a result  products incorporating our technologies may not be brought to market  meet quality control standards  achieve commercial acceptance or generate meaningful royalty revenue for us 
for us to generate royalty revenue  licensees that pay us per unit royalties must manufacture and distribute products incorporating our touch enabling technologies in a timely fashion and generate consumer demand through marketing and other promotional activities 
products incorporating our touch enabling technologies are generally difficult to design and manufacture which may cause product introduction delays or quality control problems 
if our licensees fail to stimulate and capitalize upon market demand for products that generate royalties for us  or if products are recalled because of quality control problems  our revenues will not grow and could decline 

table of contents peak demand for products that incorporate our technologies  especially in the computer gaming peripherals market  typically occurs in the third and fourth calendar quarters as a result of increased demand during the year end holiday season 
if our licensees do not ship licensed products in a timely fashion or fail to achieve strong sales in the fourth quarter of the calendar year  we may not receive related royalty revenue 
reduced spending by corporate research and development departments may adversely affect sales of our three dimensional and professional products 
we believe that the current economic downturn has led to a reduction in corporations budgets for research and development in several sectors  including the automotive and aerospace sectors  that use our three dimensional and professional products 
sales of our three dimensional and professional products  including our cyberglove line of whole hand sensing gloves and our microscribe g line of three dimensional digitizers may be adversely affected by these cuts in corporate research and development budgets 
we have limited distribution channels and resources to market and sell our medical simulation and three dimensional simulation products  and if we are unsuccessful in marketing and selling these products we may not achieve or sustain product revenue growth 
we have limited resources for marketing and selling medical simulation or three dimensional simulation products either directly or through distributors 
to achieve our business objectives we must build a balanced mixture of sales through a direct sales channel and through qualified distribution channels 
the success of our efforts to sell medical simulation and three dimensional simulation products will depend upon our ability to retain and develop a qualified sales force and effective distributor channels 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel necessary to sell and market our simulation products 
a number of our distributors represent small specialized companies that may not have sufficient capital or human resources to support the complexities of selling and supporting simulation products 
there is no assurance that our direct selling efforts will be effective  distributors will market our products successfully or  if our relationships with distributors terminate  we will be able to establish relationships with other distributors on satisfactory terms  if at all 
any disruption in the distribution  sales or marketing network for our simulation products could have a material adverse effect on our product revenues 
litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be expensive  disruptive  and time consuming  could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property  and could adversely affect our business 
intellectual property litigation  whether brought by us or by others against us  could result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management s time and efforts 
from time to time  we initiate claims against third parties that we believe infringe our intellectual property rights 
we intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously and may initiate litigation against parties that we believe are infringing our intellectual property if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation 
litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly  time consuming and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property 
in addition  any litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause product shipment delays  require us to develop non infringing technology or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements even before the issue of infringement has been decided on the merits 
if any litigation were not resolved in our favor  we could become subject to substantial damage claims from third parties and indemnification claims from our licensees 
we and our licensees could be enjoined from the continued use of the technology at issue without a royalty or license agreement 
royalty or license agreements  if required  might not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if a third party claiming infringement against us prevailed and we could not develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost effective basis  our expenses would increase and our revenues could decrease 
we attempt to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may hold  or may in the future be issued  patents that could be infringed by our products or technologies 
any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us with respect to the products that we manufacture 
table of contents and the technologies that we license 
from time to time  we have received letters from companies  several of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do  asserting that some of our technologies  or those of our licensees  infringe their intellectual property rights 
certain of our licensees have received similar letters from these or other companies 
such letters may influence our licensees decisions whether to ship products incorporating our technologies 
although none of these matters has resulted in litigation to date  any of these notices  or additional notices that we could receive in the future from these or other companies  could lead to litigation 
we have acquired patents from third parties and also license some technologies from third parties 
we must rely upon the owners of the patents or the technologies for information on the origin and ownership of the acquired or licensed technologies 
as a result  our exposure to infringement claims may increase 
we generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of acquired or licensed technology and indemnification to cover any breach of these representations 
however  representations may not be accurate and indemnification may not provide adequate compensation for breach of the representations 
intellectual property claims against us or our licensees  whether or not they have merit  could be time consuming to defend  cause product shipment delays  require us to pay damages  harm existing license arrangements  or require us or our licensees to cease utilizing the technology unless we can enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  claims could also result in claims from our licensees under the indemnification provisions of their agreements with us 
if we fail to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  our ability to license our technologies and to generate revenues would be impaired 
our business depends on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property rights and by selling products that incorporate our technologies 
if we are not able to protect and enforce those rights  our ability to obtain future licenses and royalty revenue could be impaired 
in addition  if a court were to limit the scope of  declare unenforceable or invalidate any of our patents  current licensees may refuse to make royalty payments or may themselves choose to challenge one or more of our patents 
also it is possible that our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents  our patents may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights  and effective patent protection may not be available in every country in which our licensees do business 
we also rely on licenses  confidentiality agreements and copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
it is possible that laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technologies or deter others from developing similar technologies  and policing unauthorized use of our products and trademarks would be difficult  expensive and time consuming  particularly overseas 
product liability claims could be time consuming and costly to defend  and could expose us to loss 
claims that our products or our licensees products have flaws or other defects that lead to personal or other injury are common in the computer peripherals industry and medical fields 
if products that we or our licensees sell cause personal injury  financial loss or other injury to our or our licensees customers  the customers or our licensees may seek damages or other recovery from us 
any claims against us would be time consuming  expensive to defend and distracting to management and could result in damages and injure our reputation or the reputation of our licensees or their products 
this damage could limit the market for our and our licensees products and harm our results of operations 
in the past  manufacturers of peripheral products  such as computer mice and certain gaming products such as joysticks  wheels or gamepads  have been subject to claims alleging that use of their products has caused or contributed to various types of repetitive stress injuries  including carpal tunnel syndrome 
we have not experienced any product liability claims to date 
although our license agreements typically contain 
table of contents provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability claims  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could limit or invalidate the provisions 
because we have a fixed payment license with microsoft  our royalty revenue from licensing joysticks and steering wheels in the gaming market might decline if microsoft increases its volume of sales of touch enabled joysticks and steering wheels at the expense of our other licensees 
under the terms of our present agreement with microsoft  microsoft receives a perpetual  worldwide  irrevocable  non exclusive license under our patents for microsoft s sidewinder force feedback pro joystick and its sidewinder force feedback wheel  and for a future replacement version of these specific sidewinder products having essentially similar functional features 
instead of an ongoing royalty on microsoft s sales of licensed products  the agreement provided for a payment of million  which we recognized in equal monthly increments over a one year period that ended in mid july we will not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under our current agreement with microsoft 
at the present time  we do not have a license agreement with microsoft for products other than the sidewinder joystick and steering wheel 
microsoft has a significant share of the market for touch enabled joysticks and steering wheels for personal computers 
microsoft has significantly greater financial  sales and marketing resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger customer base  than our other licensees 
in the event that microsoft increases its share of this market  our royalty revenue from other licensees in this market segment might decline 
the higher cost of products incorporating our touch enabling technologies may inhibit or prevent the widespread adoption and sale of products incorporating our technologies 
personal computer gaming peripherals  computer mice and automotive controls incorporating our touch enabling technologies are more expensive than similar competitive products that are not touch enabled 
although major manufacturers  such as logitech  microsoft  alps electric co 
and bmw  have licensed our technology  the greater expense of products containing our touch enabling technologies as compared to non touch enabled products may be a significant barrier to the widespread adoption and sale of touch enabled products 
competition between our products and our licensees products may reduce our revenue 
rapid technological change  short product life cycles  cyclical market patterns  declining average selling prices and increasing foreign and domestic competition characterize the markets in which we and our licensees compete 
we believe that competition in these markets will continue to be intense  and that competitive pressures will drive the price of our products and our licensees products downward 
these price reductions  if not offset by increases in unit sales or productivity  will cause our revenues to decline 
we face competition from unlicensed products as well 
our licensees or other third parties may seek to develop products  which they believe do not require a license under our intellectual property 
these potential competitors may have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  and the costs associated with asserting our intellectual property rights against such products and such potential competitors could be significant 
moreover  if such alternative designs were determined by a court not to require a license under our intellectual property rights  competition from such unlicensed products could limit or reduce our revenues 
if we are unable to continually improve  and reduce the cost of our technologies  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products  which could impair our revenue growth 
our ability to achieve revenue growth depends on our continuing ability to improve  and reduce the cost of  our technologies and to introduce these technologies to the marketplace in a timely manner 
if our development efforts are not successful or are significantly delayed  companies may not incorporate our technologies into their products and our revenue growth may be impaired 

table of contents if we fail to develop new or enhanced technologies for new applications and platforms  we may not be able to create a market for our technologies or our technologies may become obsolete and our ability to grow and our results of operations might be harmed 
our initiatives to develop new and enhanced technologies and to commercialize these technologies for new applications and new platforms may not be successful 
any new or enhanced technologies may not be favorably received by consumers and could damage our reputation or our brand 
expanding our technology could also require significant additional expenses and strain our management  financial and operational resources 
moreover  technology products generally have relatively short product life cycles and our current products may become obsolete in the future 
our ability to generate revenues will be harmed if we fail to develop new technologies  our new technologies fail to gain market acceptance  or our current products become obsolete 
we depend on a single supplier to produce some of our medical simulators and may lose customers if this supplier does not meet our requirements 
we have one supplier for some of our custom medical simulators 
our custom immersion medical simulators improve the performance and training of medical personnel 
any disruption in the manufacturing process from our sole supplier could adversely affect the company s ability to deliver our products  ensure quality workmanship and could result in a reduction of the company s product sales 
medical licensing and certification authorities may not endorse or require use of our technologies for training purposes  significantly slowing or inhibiting the market penetration of our medical simulation technologies 
several key medical certification bodies  including the american board of internal medicine abim and the american college of cardiology acc  have great influence in endorsing particular medical methodologies  including medical training methodologies  for use by medical professionals 
in the event that the abim and the acc  as well as other  similar bodies  do not endorse our medical simulation training products as a training vehicle  market penetration for our products could be significantly and adversely affected 
automobiles incorporating our touch enabling technologies are subject to lengthy product development periods  making it difficult to predict when and whether we will receive per unit automotive royalties 
the product development process for automobiles is very lengthy 
we do not earn per unit royalty revenue on our automotive technologies unless  and until  automobiles featuring our technologies are shipped to customers  which may not occur until several years after we enter into an agreement with an automobile manufacturer 
throughout the product development process  we face the risk that an automobile manufacturer or supplier may delay the incorporation of  or choose not to incorporate  our technologies into its automobiles  making it difficult for us to predict the per unit automotive royalties we may receive  if any 
victor viegas  our president  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and director  recently became the chief executive officer and director of the company and if there are difficulties with this leadership transition it could impede the execution of our business strategy victor viegas  our president  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and director  took over the duties of chief executive officer and director in october our success will depend to a significant extent on his ability to implement a successful strategy  to successfully lead and motivate our employees  and to work effectively with our executive staff and board of directors 
if this leadership transition is not successful  our ability to execute our business strategy would be impeded 

table of contents we might be unable to retain or recruit necessary personnel  which could slow the development and deployment of our technologies 
our ability to develop and deploy our technologies and to sustain our revenue growth depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key personnel and upon hiring additional key personnel 
a number of employees of our subsidiaries  including several members of these subsidiaries senior management  have departed since the acquisitions were completed 
it may not be possible to retain enough key employees of our subsidiaries to operate these businesses effectively 
we may hire additional sales  support  marketing and research and development personnel 
we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future 
our executive officers and key employees hold stock options with exercise prices considerably above the current market price of our common stock 
in addition  merit increases were suspended for fiscal each of these factors may impair our ability to retain the services of our executive officers and key employees 
our technologies are complex and we rely upon the continued service of our existing engineering personnel to support licensees  enhance existing technology and develop new technologies 
our major stockholders retain significant control over us  which may lead to conflicts with other stockholders over corporate governance matters and could also affect the volatility of our stock price 
certain stockholders hold a substantial amount of our outstanding common stock 
acting together  these stockholders would be able to exercise significant influence over matters that our stockholders vote upon  including the election of directors and mergers or other business combinations  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over or merging with us 
further  if any individuals in this group elect to sell a significant portion or all of their holdings of our common stock  the trading price of our common stock could experience volatility 
because personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies currently must work with microsoft s operating system software  our costs could increase and our revenues could decline if microsoft modifies its operating system software 
our hardware and software technology for personal computer peripheral products that incorporate our touch enabling technologies is currently compatible with microsoft s windows  windows  windows me and windows xp operating systems software  including directx  microsoft s entertainment applications programming interface 
if microsoft modifies its operating system  including directx  we may need to modify our technologies and this could cause delays in the release of products by our licensees 
if microsoft modifies its software products in ways that limit the use of our other licensees products  our costs could be increased and our revenues could decline 
legislative actions  higher insurance cost and potential new accounting pronouncements are likely to impact our future financial position and results of operations 
there have been regulatory changes  including the sarbanes oxley act of  and there may potentially be new accounting pronouncements or additional regulatory rulings which will have an impact on our future financial position and results of operations 
the sarbanes oxley act of and other rule changes as well as proposed legislative initiatives following the enron bankruptcy are likely to increase general and administrative costs 
in addition  insurers are likely to increase premiums as a result of high claims rates over the past year  which we expect will increase our premiums for our various insurance policies 
further  proposed initiatives are expected to result in changes in certain accounting rules  including legislative and other proposals to account for employee stock options as a compensation expense 
these and other potential changes could materially increase the expenses we report under generally accepted accounting principles  and adversely affect our operating results 

table of contents if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to a catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  earthquake  power outage or terrorist activity 
california has experienced problems with its power supply in recent years 
as a result  we have experienced utility cost increases and may experience unexpected interruptions in our power supply that could have a material adverse effect on our sales  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  a substantial portion of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in san jose  california  an area with a history of seismic events 
any such loss at our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expenses to repair and replace the facility 
while we believe that we maintain insurance sufficient to cover most long term potential losses at our facilities  our existing insurance may not be adequate for all possible losses 
we have experienced rapid growth and change in our business  and our failure to manage this and any future growth could harm our business 
any future periods of rapid growth may place significant strains on our managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
the rate of any future expansion  in combination with our complex technologies  may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating and meeting our operational needs as well as the needs of our licensees 
we may engage in acquisitions that could dilute stockholders interests  divert management attention or cause integration problems 
as part of our business strategy  we have in the past acquired  and may in the future acquire  businesses or intellectual property that we feel could complement our business  enhance our technical capabilities or increase our intellectual property portfolio 
if we consummate acquisitions through an exchange of our securities  our stockholders could suffer significant dilution 
acquisitions could also create risks for us  including unanticipated costs associated with the acquisitions  use of substantial portions of our available cash to consummate the acquisitions  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  difficulties in assimilation of acquired personnel or operations  and potential intellectual property infringement claims related to newly acquired product lines 
any acquisitions  even if successfully completed  might not generate significant additional revenue or provide any benefit to our business 
we could lose some or all of the investment that we have made in an early stage technology company if that company is not successful in developing its technologies or unable to obtain additional financing if and when needed 
from time to time we have made strategic investments in early stage technology companies that are developing technologies that we believe could complement or enhance our own technologies  if successful 
we have made these investments to provide funding for the development of these companies technologies primarily because of the anticipated benefits to immersion of the availability of these technologies 
the prospect of realizing a substantial return on these investments was a secondary  though important  consideration 
we wrote down million of these investments in the third quarter of  and in the third quarter of we wrote down million of these investments and approximately  of interest receivable from these companies  and do not expect to realize any return on these amounts 
our remaining investment may not succeed in developing its technology  might be unsuccessful in marketing its technology or products based on its technology or might fail for any number of other reasons  including an inability to obtain additional capital if required to fund operations  including the completion of the development of its technology 
in the event that 
table of contents this company in which we have invested fails or does not achieve a level of success that permits us to realize the value of this investment  we could experience a complete or partial loss on some or all of this investment 
if we experience additional losses and related write downs on the carrying value of our remaining investment  it would decrease our assets and increase our losses

table of contents license fees charged for our intellectual property portfolio 
royalties from our gaming licensees decreased by  due to the decline in sales of general computing and pc gaming peripheral devices as well as delayed product introductions from some of our licensees 
the decrease in gaming royalties was offset by an increase of  in automotive royalties and license fees and an increase of  in medical royalty and license revenue due in part from signing new automotive and medical license agreements during product sales for the period ended increased by  or from to the increase in product sales is primarily due to a million increase in sales of our medical products as compared to offset by decreased microprocessor sales of  and decreased three dimensional capture and interaction products sales of  medical product sales consist of sales of our virtual reality medical simulators in the vascular  endoscopic  endovascular  and laparoscopic product lines 
demand for medical products increased across all product lines  and in particular the endoscopy simulator 
the decline in our microprocessor sales is based on a decision to decrease the sales effort related to this low margin product line as well as reduced volume requirements from our licensees who use this microprocessor solution 
sale of our three dimensional capture and interaction products such as our microscribe g and our line of whole hand interface devices decreased in from mainly due to delays in purchasing decisions by customers affected by the current economic slowdown

total revenues for the year ended december  increased by million or to million from million in royalty and license revenue increased by million or from to the increase was due mainly to an increased number of product offerings by our licensees that generate per unit royalties  most notably in the gaming console market  as well as royalties from new licensees 
during  royalty revenue included million recognized under our agreement with microsoft which ended mid july we did not receive any further revenues or royalties from microsoft under that agreement from july through product sales increased by million or from to the increase in product sales is primarily due to an increase in medical product sales of million  an increase of million for our three dimensional interaction products and an increase of  in microprocessor sales  offset by a decrease of  in softmouse sales 
the increase in medical products sold is attributed to new product introductions and greater market awareness during versus the increase in three dimensional interaction products sales is due to the august acquisition of vti accounted for under the purchase method and therefore accordingly  these products sales were not fully reflected in our fiscal year revenues 
development contract and other revenue decreased by  or from to the decrease in contract activity is mainly attributed to the conclusion of several long term contracts  which included the lightscribe d products in  and the conscious shift in focus from contract and research and development revenues to product sales

product sales volume increased by from to but direct material and labor costs decreased by  or due to the reduction in sales of our lower margin products such as our microprocessors causing a favorable product mix and reduced direct costs 
inventory write downs decreased by  largely due to a significant write down taken during fiscal for our lightscribe product line and royalties costs decreased by  from to due to the elimination of royalties due on our microscribe g product line

summary disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles 
table of contents generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  patents and intangible assets  inventories  contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we derive our revenues from three principle sources royalties  product sales  and development contracts 
we recognize royalty revenue based on royalty reports or related information received from the licensee as well as time based licenses of our intellectual property portfolio 
up front payments under license agreements are deferred and recognized as revenue based on either the royalty reports received or amortized over the license period depending on the nature of the agreement 
advance payments under license agreements that also require the company to provide future services to the licensee are deferred and recognized over the service period when vendor specific objective evidence related to the value of the services does not exist 
if the information received from our licensees regarding royalties is incorrect or inaccurate  it could adversely affect revenue in future periods 
to date all information received from our licensees has caused no material reduction in future period revenues 
we recognize revenues from product sales when the product is shipped provided collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligation remains 
development contract revenues are recognized under the cost to cost percentage of completion accounting method based on physical completion of the work to be performed 
our revenue recognition policies are significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in greater or future operating losses 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our review and assessment of our customers ability to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
to date such estimated losses have been within our expectations 
we provide for estimated costs of future anticipated product returns and warranty obligations based on historical experience when related revenues are recognized and defer warranty related revenue over the related warranty term 
we have acquired patents and other intangibles 
our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets and we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets that affect our consolidated financial statements 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets  in addition  changes could affect the amount of future period amortization expense that we will incur 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january  and accordingly  we analyzed goodwill for impairment issues during the first six months of fiscal our periodic impairment test was performed during the fourth quarter in conjunction with the annual forecasting process and it was determined that an impairment of goodwill had occurred 
during the fourth quarter  an impairment of goodwill loss of million was recognized

the interpretation explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
our foreign operations are limited in scope and thus we are not materially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations

we intend to hold our equity investments for the long term and will monitor whether there has been other than temporary declines in their values based on management s estimates of their net realizable value taking into account the companies respective financial condition and ability to raise third party financing

the remaining cost basis of these investments on our consolidated balance sheet is million 
we will monitor the remaining value of these investments  and may determine that there could be other impairment losses in the future 
as of december   management has determined that the carrying value of these investments at million is appropriate
