item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly in risk factors 
see also business cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the consolidated financial statements and related information contained in this annual report on form k reflect our results as they existed for the fiscal year ended january  on august   we completed the sale of our managed services business to eds 
as a result  the financial information for the fiscal year ended january  and other periods presented is not related to our software business and is not indicative of future results from our software business 
overview we are a provider of data center automation software for enterprises  government agencies and service providers seeking to reduce costs and increase the quality of data center operations 
our software automates key server and software operations in data centers  including provisioning  changing  configuring  scaling  securing  recovering  auditing  and reallocating servers and business applications 
we refer to our software as the opsware system 
the opsware system works across geographically disparate locations and heterogeneous data center environments 
by using the opsware system  our customers can more quickly deploy new servers and applications  speed operations to respond quickly to changing business needs  and increase the efficiency of their data center operations 
the opsware system enables our customers to reduce the number of it staff required to operate the data center  better utilize server and software assets  increase it efficiencies and achieve higher service quality 
prior to august  we primarily provided managed internet services for corporations and government agencies that operate mission critical internet applications 
we used our proprietary opsware automation technology in the managed services business  and have since developed this technology into our opsware system software 
in august  we sold our managed services business to eds for a total purchase price of million in cash 
in addition to the license and maintenance agreements entered into pursuant to the asset purchase agreement  contemporaneous with execution of the asset purchase agreement  we executed separate license and maintenance agreements with eds pursuant to which we granted eds a non exclusive  worldwide hosting and integration license whereby eds will have certain rights to use our opsware software 
under the opsware license and maintenance agreement  eds will pay us subject to our developing specified features and functions a minimum license and maintenance fee of million in the aggregate over a term of three years 
subsequent to the fiscal year ended january   we delivered and received acceptance of all of the specified features and functions owing to eds 
we believe we have sufficient objective and reliable evidence of fair value for both the value of the managed services business sold to eds and the million license and maintenance agreement based on renewal rates 
we further believe that the million license and maintenance agreement is a separate earnings process and does not affect the quality of use or the value to eds of the million sale of the managed services business 
accordingly  we will recognize the fees from eds as license revenue over the remaining term of the license  beginning in the three month period ended april  we expect that our operating results will be largely dependent on our relationship with eds for the foreseeable future 
our customers in the managed services business typically purchased our services through customer service agreements  which generally had terms of one to three years 
our customer service agreements were generally renewed automatically for periods ranging from three months to one year  unless terminated prior to the expiration of the initial term 
we generally recognized revenue related to these agreements ratably over the period the managed services were provided to the respective customers 

table of contents in the software business  we will derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales of software licenses 
we sell our products principally through our direct sales force and intend to develop indirect channels with corporate partners  such as distributors  value added resellers  hardware providers and systems integrators 
we will also derive revenue from sales of annual support and maintenance agreements and professional services 
in may  while operating the managed services business  we announced a restructuring program to improve utilization of our existing technology and infrastructure 
this restructuring program included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of the resulting excess facilities and a provision for excess and obsolete property and equipment 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million classified as operating expenses 
included in the million was a noncash charge of million related to the acceleration of vesting of options held by certain employees 
of the total charge  million was recovered through the sale of assets and liabilities related to the managed services business  during the fiscal year ended january  in september  while operating the managed services business  we announced an organizational realignment to increase operational effectiveness and reduce costs 
this organizational realignment included hiring in key areas  such as direct sales representatives and specific technology positions  and the elimination of certain positions 
as a result of the realignment program  we recorded reorganization costs of million classified as operating expenses 
all of the costs associated with the september organizational realignment were workforce related 
in june  we repurchased from morgan stanley co 
incorporated our senior discount notes due for million of cash and issued  shares of common stock  representing million worth of our common stock at that time 
as a result  an extraordinary gain of million was recognized during the fiscal year ended january  the extraordinary gain was calculated by taking the difference between the carrying value of the notes at the time of retirement and the million given in total consideration 
in june  we announced a restructuring program in connection with our entering into an agreement to sell the assets and liabilities of our managed services business to eds  which included a worldwide workforce reduction and a provision for the impairment of excess and obsolete property and equipment 
as a result of the restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million classified as operating expenses 
in august  we announced a restructuring program in connection with the closing of the sale of our managed services business to eds 
the restructuring program was accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 which we adopted in july the restructuring program included a provision for the resulting excess facilities and a provision for excess and obsolete property and equipment 
the lease payments on excess facilities were based on management s estimates of its ability to sublease excess facilities based on prevailing real estate market conditions at that time 
as a result  we recorded restructuring costs of million classified as operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the private placement of our preferred stock  our initial public offering of common stock  customer revenue  the sale of our managed services business  the sale of our senior discount notes and  to a lesser extent  operating equipment lease financing and capital equipment lease financing 
as of january   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
on august   we received million in gross cash proceeds million net of transactions expenses from the sale of our managed services business to eds 
on march   we received approximately million in net cash proceeds from the sale of our common stock in an initial public offering and a private placement to compaq

net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was primarily attributable to the retirement of the senior discount notes and principal payments on capital leases  partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the payments received from stockholder notes receivables 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the completion of our initial public offering  the payments of notes receivable and the exercise of stock options 
in fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock 
in fiscal  we also received net proceeds from the sale of senior discount notes 
under the asset purchase agreement with eds  we have retained various liabilities relating to the managed services business and have agreed to indemnify eds up to a maximum of million  for any breach of our representations and warranties contained in the asset purchase agreement and for other matters  including certain liabilities retained by us under that agreement  subject to limitations 
we believe that the likelihood of our obligation to indemnify eds for these matters is remote 
however  if eds makes a claim for indemnification  we may be required to expend significant cash resources in defense and settlement of the claim 
as of january   our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases for facilities and capital leases 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years greater than years contractual obligations capital leases operating leases  net of subleases total contractual cash obligations 
table of contents we believe that our current cash balances  including cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
nevertheless  we may restructure existing obligations or seek additional capital through private equity  equipment lease facilities  bank financings or arrangements with strategic partners 
capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our products  costs of providing our products and services  the timing and extent of research and development projects and increases in our operating expenses 
to the extent that existing cash and cash equivalents balances and any cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
we cannot be sure that additional financing will be available if necessary or available on reasonable terms 
we may from time to time evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  services  products and technologies  which could increase our capital requirements

for the year ended january   no customer 
table of contents accounted for more than of our net revenue 
for the year ended january   nike and atriax accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
we expect total revenue to decrease in the next fiscal year  and  as a result  we expect to continue to experience losses from operations for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we expect that a significant portion of our net revenue in the next fiscal year will be attributable to the license and maintenance agreement with eds 
we will recognize the fees from eds as license revenue over the remaining term of the license  beginning in the three month period ended april  cost of revenue 
in the managed services business  cost of revenue consisted primarily of payments on rental equipment  salaries and related personnel expenses of our employees who provided services to our customers  leases of data center space in third party facilities  customer support services  including network monitoring and support  and depreciation and amortization of capitalized equipment and software

research and development 
in both the managed services business and the software business  research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses and depreciation and amortization of purchased equipment and software 
research and development expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenue  to million  or of net revenue  in fiscal from million  or of net revenue  in fiscal  when it increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of net revenue  from million  or of net revenue  in fiscal the decrease in fiscal in comparison to prior periods was primarily the result of reduced headcount and facility costs resulting from our restructuring programs and the sale of our managed services business to eds 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily as a result of an increase in related employee headcount  the rental of equipment  the depreciation of purchased equipment used in the potential development of new service offerings and a million non cash stock compensation charge recognized during fiscal for options issued to a consultant 
we expect that our research and development expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in the next fiscal year 
sales and marketing 
in the managed services business  sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses  as well as advertising  trade shows and other promotional expenses 
in the software business  sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel expenses  trade shows and other promotional expenses

general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal primarily as a result of increases in administrative and management personnel and expenses necessary to support our expanded operations 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal also reflected increased outside professional advisor costs and the costs associated with being a public company 
we expect that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in absolute dollars in the next fiscal year 
restructuring costs 
in fiscal  we announced two restructuring programs executed in connection with the sale of our managed services business to eds 
we recorded restructuring costs of million in the quarter ended july  and million in the quarter ended october  the restructuring programs included a worldwide workforce reduction  a provision for the resulting excess facilities and provisions for excess and obsolete property and equipment 
we also recorded restructuring costs of million during the quarter ended july   related to a restructuring program executed in may  which included a worldwide workforce reduction  consolidation of the resulting excess facilities and a provision for excess and obsolete property and equipment 
included in this charge was a noncash charge of million related to the acceleration of stock options for certain employees 
of this charge  million was recovered through the sale of assets and liabilities related to the managed services business  during fiscal in september  we announced a restructuring program and an organizational realignment to improve utilization of our existing technology and infrastructure 
the organizational realignment in september included hiring in key areas  such as direct sales representatives and specific technology positions  and the elimination of certain positions 
as a result of the organizational realignment  we recorded a reorganization charge of million related to the elimination of certain positions  which was included in operating expense in the quarter ended october  for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  please see note  restructuring costs  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense benefit was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  when it decreased from million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to the reversal of million of stock based compensation expense related to the termination of employees in fiscal in connection with the sale of our managed services business to eds and reflected previously recognized expense on stock awards for which the terminated employees had not vested in the underlying shares 
as a result  the difference between the expense taken under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been reflected under the straight line vesting method was required to be reversed upon termination of these employees 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was partly due to a reversal of million of deferred compensation associated with the termination of employees in connection with the restructuring and reorganization initiatives taken in may and september who had not vested in the underlying shares 
in addition  amortization of stock based compensation decreased each year as a result of our use of the graded vesting method 
the remaining deferred stock based compensation as of january  was million 
gain on the sale of assets and liabilities related to managed services business 
on august   we received million in net cash proceeds from the sale of the assets and liabilities of our managed services business to eds 
the sale included the disposal of million of assets  including million of property and equipment  million of accounts receivable  million of other current assets and million of other assets  and million of liabilities  including million of accounts payable  million of accrued liabilities  million of deferred revenue and million of capital leases 
in addition  we incurred transaction costs of million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of the assets and liabilities of our managed services business in the amount of million 
the million gain is offset by a provision of million related to capital gains in a foreign jurisdiction which results in million 

table of contents interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income expense  net  increased to a benefit of million in fiscal from an expense of million in fiscal  when the expense increased from an expense of million in fiscal the increase to a benefit in interest and other income expense in fiscal from fiscal was due to proceeds received from a settlement in connection with an early termination of a sublease and a settlement in connection with an early contract termination for our managed services  offset by interest expense related to our senior discount notes  a settlement in connection with the termination of a merger agreement  in addition to a decrease in interest income due to a decline in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the increase in expense in interest and other income expense in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to interest related to our senior discount notes combined with the relatively constant interest and other income earned primarily on proceeds from our initial public offering 
provision for income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal the tax expense recorded in fiscal related to foreign taxes incurred in connection with the sale of the assets and liabilities related to our managed services business 
as of january   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of million available to offset future taxable income  which may be used  subject to limitations  to offset future state and federal taxable income through and  respectively 
we have recorded a valuation allowance against the entire net operating loss carry forwards because of the uncertainty that we will be able to realize the benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
deemed non cash dividend 
we recorded a million non cash dividend in fiscal due to the beneficial conversion feature in our series c convertible preferred stock because of the difference between the deemed fair value at the date of issuance and actual issuance price 
in june  we sold approximately million shares of series c preferred stock to new and existing investors for a total purchase price of million in order to raise funds to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
extraordinary item 
we recorded a gain from retirement of senior discount notes of million in fiscal in june  we repurchased from morgan stanley co 
incorporated our senior discount notes due for million of cash and issued  shares of our common stock  representing million worth of our common stock at that time 
the extraordinary gain was calculated by taking the difference between the carrying value of the notes at the time of retirement and the million given in total consideration 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  our estimates may change based upon changed circumstances and as we reassess our underlying assumptions from time to time 
the securities and exchange commission has described the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe the following are our critical accounting policies  which affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
prior to august   the closing of the sale of our managed services business to eds  we generated revenue in our managed services business through the sale of managed internet services 
substantially all revenue recognized prior to august  was generated from our managed services business 
we recognized revenue ratably over the managed services contract period as services were fulfilled  provided that the earnings process was complete 
if obligations remained after services were delivered  revenue was recognized after such obligations were fulfilled 
in addition  we provided certain guarantees regarding scheduled uptime to our customers on a monthly basis 

table of contents we reduced revenue generated in the managed service business for credits given for estimated unscheduled downtime on a monthly basis 
according to our accounting policy and customer contracts  the revenue credits were based on the cause of downtime  the length of the downtime and the customer s monthly price of the services 
the estimated credit reduced revenue in the month in which the unscheduled downtime occurred 
in addition to the service credits  we occasionally issued credits for events that were outside of the contractual service level agreements 
these types of credits were not financially significant 
the process for estimating these types of credits included analyzing the historical experiences with such credits and comparing them to events that occurred in the then current month 
as part of the our software business going forward we will recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants  or aicpa  statement of position  or sop  no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 deferral of the effective date of sop  software revenue recognition  sop no 
 modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  and sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
for each transaction  we determine whether evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria are met 
if we receive cash from customers  but have not met the criteria for revenue recognition  the amounts received are included in advances from customers 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond twelve months and other arrangements with payment terms longer than normal not to be fixed or determinable 
if collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fee is collected 
generally  no customer has the right of return 
we will generate revenue from the sale of software licenses and services related to the software business  including from maintenance and support agreements and professional service agreements 
we expect the sale of software licenses and maintenance to be the primary component of our revenue 
license revenue will be comprised of fees for multi year or perpetual licenses  which are derived from contracts with customers 
once we establish vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance  we will recognize license revenue based upon the residual method after all elements other than maintenance have been delivered as prescribed by sop we will recognize maintenance revenue over the term of the maintenance contract once vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance exists 
in accordance with paragraph of sop  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of maintenance is determined by reference to the price the customer will be required to pay when maintenance is sold separately that is  the stated rate 
customers that enter into maintenance contracts generally have the ability to renew these contracts at the renewal rate 
maintenance contracts are typically one year in duration 
if we are not able to establish vendor specific objective evidence of maintenance  both the license and maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
for term licenses accompanied by maintenance  the entire arrangement fee will be recognized over the term of the license period 
for a further discussion on our treatment of revenue recognition in connection with the million license and maintenance agreement with eds please see note  transactions with eds  in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
services revenue will be comprised of revenue from maintenance and support agreements and professional services arrangements 
in all cases  we assess whether the service element of the arrangement is essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement 
when services are considered essential or the arrangement involves customization or modification of our software and when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the services  both the license and services revenues under the arrangement will be recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting based upon input measures of hours 
when such estimates are not available  the completed contract method will be utilized 
when an arrangement includes contractual milestones  we will recognize revenue as such milestones are achieved provided the milestones are not subject to any additional acceptance criteria 
for those arrangements where we have 
table of contents concluded that the services element is not essential to the other elements of the arrangement  we then determine whether the services are available for other customers  do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria and whether we are able to provide the service in order to separately account for the services revenue 
when the services qualify for separate accounting  we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the services and maintenance to account for the arrangement using the residual method  regardless of any separate prices stated within the contract for each element 
revenue allocable to services is recognized as the services are performed 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of consulting services is based upon hourly rates 
we will enter into standalone contracts for professional services and these contracts provide for payment upon a time and materials basis 
the hourly rates associated with these contracts are used to assess the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value in multi element arrangements 
we intend to recognize revenue associated with software licenses and services sold to distributors  system integrators and value added resellers collectively resellers 
in connection with these arrangements  there is no right of return or price protection for sales to resellers 
we will not recognize revenue from resellers when we are aware that a reseller does not have a purchase order or other contractual agreement from an end user 
the timing of our recognition of revenue will depend upon the mix of revenue that is recognized under the residual method  pursuant to sop  under the percentage of completion method or completed contract of accounting  pursuant to sop  or in connection with multi year licenses as well as the timing of our establishment of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance 
if vendor specific objective evidence of maintenance is not established  both the license and maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
given our limited experience operating our software business  we cannot currently predict what the mix of our revenue will be in the next fiscal year 
impairment of long lived assets 
we continually review the carrying value of long lived assets  including property and equipment to determine whether there are any indications of impairment losses 
according to our accounting policy  when such indicators are present  if the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from our customers is less than the carrying value of our long lived assets  we compare the estimated discounted future net cash flows to be generated from our customers to the carrying value of the long lived assets to determine any impairment charges 
we reduce the carrying value of the long lived assets if the carrying value of the long lived assets is greater than the estimated discounted future net cash flow 
restructuring costs 
during fiscal and  we restructured our business under plans approved by the board of directors by reducing our headcount  consolidating our facilities and disposing of excess and obsolete property and equipment 
as a result of these actions  we recorded restructuring and other related charges consisting of cash severance payments to be made to severed employees and lease payments related to property abandoned as a result of our facilities consolidation 
we are attempting to sublet non cancelable leased facilities that we have vacated 
if the length of time before we find tenants for these facilities or the market rental rates differ significantly from our estimates  our actual costs will differ from the charge that was initially recorded 
our estimates include the review of the financial condition of our existing sublessees as well as the state of the regional real estate markets 
each reporting period  we will review these estimates based on the status of execution of our restructuring plan and  to the extent that these assumptions change due to changes in market conditions and our business  the ultimate restructuring expenses could vary by material amounts  and could result in additional expenses or the recovery of amounts previously recorded 
accruals and contingencies 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential 
table of contents liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  we have retained various liabilities related to our managed services business 
the outcome of these liabilities could result in a material difference from our current estimates  and could result in additional expenses or the recovery of amounts previously recorded 
under our amended and restated ethernet collocation internet access service agreement with qwest  we received a million non refundable prepayment from qwest in consideration for providing services in connection with the provisioning and maintaining of three of qwest s data centers and the migration of our managed services business operations into these three data centers 
the prepayment received from qwest was originally included in deferred revenue and the residual balance as of january  has since been reclassified to accrued data center facility costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our material legal proceedings 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb approved statement of financial accounting standards no  or sfas   accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas  addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with an exit activity  including restructuring  or with a disposal of long lived assets 
exit activities include  but are not limited to  eliminating or reducing product lines  terminating employees and contracts and relocating plant facilities or personnel 
sfas specifies that a company will record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when that liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
therefore  commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and  therefore  does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and the related expense 
we adopted sfas in july in july  the fasb issued sfas  recission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas rescinds sfas and sfas related to classification of gains and losses on debt extinguishment such that most debt extinguishment gains and losses will no longer be classified as extraordinary 
sfas also amends sfas with respect to sale leaseback transactions 
we adopted sfas in the first quarter of fiscal which will require the reclassification of the gain on the extinguishment of debt from an extraordinary item in our results of operations for the periods subsequent to january  in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit  and provides new disclosure requirements regarding indemnification provisions  including indemnification provisions typically included in a software license arrangement 
it also clarifies that at the time a guarantee is issued  we must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations we assume under the guarantee and must disclose that information in our financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee do not apply to product warranties  indemnification provisions in our software license arrangements  or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements apply to guarantees outstanding as of december  we adopted fin in december we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting and records compensation expense for all stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income loss of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this 
table of contents statement amends accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial statements 
the amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the amendment of the disclosure requirements of apb opinion no 
is effective for financial reports containing condensed consolidated financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  since we have not elected to change to the fair value based method of accounting and therefore do not record compensation expense for most stock based employee compensation  the transition provisions of sfas had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the consolidated pro forma net loss applicable to common stockholders under sfas was million  million and million for the years ended january   and  respectively 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires an investor with a majority of the variable interests in a variable interest entity to consolidate the entity and also requires majority and significant variable interest investors to provide certain disclosures 
a variable interest entity is an entity in which the equity investors do not have a controlling interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance the entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from the other parties 
we adopted fin in january we do not currently have any interest in variable interest entities and  accordingly  we do not expect our adoption of fin to have any impact on our historical financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
we have limited experience operating our software business and our business model is new and unproven  which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects 
as a result of the sale of our managed services business to eds  our business model has shifted from providing managed internet services to primarily licensing our opsware system software 
due to our limited experience operating our software business  we have limited ability to forecast future demand for our products and limited financial data upon which you may evaluate our business and prospects 
our potential for future profitability must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
some of these risks relate to our potential inability to sign contracts with and deploy our products to a sufficient number of customers  particularly in light of current unfavorable economic conditions  provide high levels of support for our products and support the deployment of a higher volume of our products  develop new product offerings and extend the functionality of our existing technology  develop and extend our opsware system software to support a wide range of hardware and software to meet the diverse needs of customers  develop an effective direct sales channel to sell our opsware technology  develop additional strategic partnerships to facilitate our ability to market and sell our opsware technology  develop modules that permit our opsware technology to be integrated with the variety of existing management systems that customers may already have deployed  and establish awareness of our brand 

table of contents we may not successfully address these risks 
if we do not successfully address these risks  we may not realize sufficient revenue to reach or sustain profitability 
our financial results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our revenue and operating results could vary significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
important factors that could cause our quarterly and annual results to fluctuate materially include our ability to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  the limited number of deals we expect to close each quarter in the foreseeable future  the timing of signing and deployment of contracts with new and existing customers  the timing and magnitude of operating expenses and capital expenditures  the timing of satisfaction of our revenue recognition criteria  including the establishment of vendor specific objective evidence  costs related to the various third party technologies we may incorporate into our technology and services  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  any downturn in our customers and potential customers businesses  the timing of product releases or upgrades by us or by our competitors  and changes in the mix of revenue attributable to higher margin software products versus lower margin integration and support services 
our current and future levels of operating expenses and capital expenditures are based to an extent on our growth plans and estimates of future revenue 
these expenditure levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall  and any significant shortfall in revenue relative to planned expenditures could negatively impact our business and results of operations 
due to these and other factors  period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one period as an indication of our future performance 
in future periods  our operating results may fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
in addition  our results for fiscal  fiscal and the first nine months of fiscal primarily reflect the results of our managed services business  which are not related to or indicative of future results in our software business 
our operating results will be highly dependent upon our relationship with eds and any deterioration of our relationship with eds could adversely affect the success of our software business 
contemporaneous with the execution of the asset purchase agreement with eds  we entered into a three year million license and maintenance agreement with eds 
we expect that our operating results will be largely dependent on our relationship with eds for the foreseeable future 
if the health of our relationship with eds were to deteriorate  our business and results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  if eds financial position were to deteriorate  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our opsware license and maintenance agreement with eds is for an initial term of three years and we cannot predict whether eds will extend the license beyond three years 
whether or not eds continues to license our software may depend  in large part  on its level of customer satisfaction 
we cannot assure you that eds will 
table of contents be able to deploy our software successfully or in the time frames contemplated by the opsware license agreement 
if eds does not renew its license  our operating results will be adversely affected 
in addition  if eds does not renew its license  this may negatively impact our reputation and our ability to license our opsware software to customers more broadly 
the asset purchase agreement we entered into with eds in connection with the sale of our managed services business exposes us to contingent liabilities 
under the asset purchase agreement with eds  we have retained various liabilities relating to the managed services business and have agreed to indemnify eds  up to a maximum of million  for any breach of our representations and warranties contained in the asset purchase agreement and for other matters  including certain liabilities retained by us under that agreement  subject to limitations 
although we believe that the likelihood of our obligation to indemnify eds for these matters is remote  if eds makes a claim for indemnification  we may be required to expend significant cash resources in defense and settlement of the claim 
we must satisfy the criteria of revenue recognition in order to recognize the cash received from customers under our license agreements as revenue 
in order to recognize the cash received from our customers under our license agreements as revenue  we must demonstrate that the license arrangement satisfies the criteria for revenue recognition including that a persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant obligations with regard to implementation remain  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
if we are unable to satisfy the criteria for revenue recognition  our operating results may suffer or may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
in addition  the timing of our recognition of revenue will depend upon the mix of revenue that is recognized under the residual method  pursuant to sop  under the percentage of completion or completed contract method of accounting  pursuant to sop  or in connection with multi year licenses as well as the timing of our establishment of vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance 
if vendor specific objective evidence of maintenance is not established  both the license and maintenance revenue will be recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
given our limited experience operating our software business  we cannot currently predict what the mix of our revenue will be in the next fiscal year 
future changes in accounting standards or our interpretation of current standards  particularly changes affecting revenue recognition  could cause unexpected revenue fluctuations 
future changes in accounting standards or our interpretation of current standards  particularly those affecting revenue recognition  could require us to change our accounting policies 
these changes could cause deferral of revenue recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerate recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  each of which could impair our ability to meet securities analysts and investors expectations  which could cause a decline in our stock price 
if we are required to account for options under our employee stock plans as a compensation expense  our results of operations would be materially affected 
there has been increasing public debate about the proper accounting treatment for employee stock options 
although we are not currently required to record any compensation expense in connection with option grants that have an exercise price at or above fair market value  it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock options as a compensation expense 
any such change in accounting treatment could result in our reporting increased operating expenses  which would decrease any reported net income or increase any reported net loss 
note of our consolidated financial statements shows the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net loss and net income loss per share if it had been in effect during the reporting periods shown and if the compensation expense were calculated as described in note 
table of contents our operating results may suffer if we fail to achieve expected benefits from strategic relationships 
we have relied on in the past  and intend to continue to form in the future  strategic relationships with other technology companies in order to obtain a broader reach for our products and services 
we have entered into an agreement with bea systems  an application infrastructure software provider  under which bea will refer prospects for the opsware system to us from bea s existing customer base 
in addition  we have been selected by sun microsystems as a member of its blade solutions community and have developed opsware blade edition to support blade server environments 
we cannot guarantee that a significant amount of new customer relationships or revenue will result from these agreements 
in fact  we may not achieve any significant benefits from these relationships or similar relationships with other companies 
in addition  in the event that our strategic partners  including bea  sun or eds  experience financial difficulties  we may not be able to realize the expected benefits of these relationships 
recent unfavorable economic conditions and reductions in information technology spending could limit our ability to grow our business 
our business and operating results are subject to the effects of changes in general economic conditions 
there has been a rapid and severe downturn in the worldwide economy 
we expect this downturn to continue  but are uncertain as to its future severity and duration 
this uncertainty has increased because of the potential long term impact of terrorist attacks  the resulting military actions against terrorism and war in iraq 
in the future  fears of continued global recession  war and additional acts of terrorism may continue to impact global economies negatively 
we believe that these conditions  as well as the decline in worldwide economic conditions  have led to reduced it spending 
if these conditions worsen  demand for our products may be reduced 
our management is required to make forecasts with respect to economic trends and general business conditions in order to develop budgets  plan research and development strategies and perform a wide variety of general management functions 
to the extent that our forecasts are in error  our performance may suffer because of a failure to properly align our corporate strategy with economic conditions 
as we redeploy our assets  we may continue to incur significant operating losses and negative cash flow  and we may never be profitable 
we will be required to spend significant funds to continue developing our software products and refocus our operations  research and development and sales and marketing organizations to fit the needs of our software business 
we have incurred significant operating and net losses and negative cash flow and have not achieved operating profitability 
as of january   we had an accumulated deficit of million  which includes approximately million related to non cash deferred stock compensation 
we expect to continue to experience operating losses for the foreseeable future 
to achieve positive cash flow and operating profitability  we will need to establish a customer base for our software 
we may not be able to increase our revenue or increase our operating efficiencies in this manner 
if our revenue grows more slowly than we anticipate or if our operating expenses increase more than we expect  our cash flow and operating results will suffer 
consequently  it is possible that we will never achieve positive cash flow or profitability 
even if we do achieve positive cash flow or profitability in any one quarter  we may not sustain or increase positive cash flow or profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
in addition  any decision to restructure our operations  to exit any activity or to eliminate any excess capacity could result in significant accounting charges 
these restructuring charges could also result from future business combinations 
restructuring charges  individually or in aggregate  could create losses in future periods 

table of contents sales efforts involving large enterprises involve lengthy sales and deployment cycles  which may cause our financial results to suffer 
we intend to focus our sales efforts on enterprises  government agencies and service providers 
sales to these entities generally have a long sales cycle and the length of this sales cycle has increased in response to current economic conditions 
the length of the average sales cycle could make it more difficult for us to predict revenue and plan expenditures accordingly 
the sales cycle associated with the purchase of our products is subject to a number of significant risks over which we have little or no control  including customers budgetary constraints and internal acceptance procedures  concerns about the introduction or announcement of our or our competitors new products  and potential downturns in the it market and in economic conditions generally 
in addition  the time it takes to deploy our software with these accounts may be longer than a non enterprise customer  which may delay our ability to recognize revenue from sales to these accounts 
if we do not develop our direct sales organization we will have difficulty acquiring and retaining customers 
our products require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at a limited number of key people within our prospective customers organizations 
because the market for our technology and services is new  many prospective customers are unfamiliar with the products we offer 
as a result  our sales effort requires highly trained sales personnel 
we may need to expand our sales organization in order to increase market awareness of our products to a greater number of organizations and  in turn  to generate increased revenue 
we are in the process of developing our direct sales force  and we may require additional qualified sales personnel 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel we need 
moreover  even after we hire these individuals  they require extensive training 
if we decide to but are unable to expand our direct sales force and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our products  which may prevent us from growing our revenue and achieving and maintaining profitability 
if we do not develop our distribution channels  we will have to rely more heavily on our direct sales force to develop our business  which could limit our ability to increase revenue and grow our business 
our ability to sell our products will be impaired if we fail to develop our distribution channels 
we intend to establish multiple indirect marketing channels to increase the number of customers licensing our products 
moreover  our channel partners must market our products effectively and be qualified to provide timely and cost effective customer support and service  which requires us to provide proper training and technical support 
if our channel partners do not effectively market and sell our products or choose to place greater emphasis on products offered by our competitors  our ability to grow our business and sell our products may be negatively affected 
if we do not develop and maintain productive relationships with systems integrators  our ability to generate sales leads and increase our revenue sources may be limited 
we intend to develop and rely on additional relationships with a number of computing and systems integration firms to enhance our sales  support  service and marketing efforts  particularly with respect to the implementation and support of our products  as well as to help generate sales leads and assist in the sales process 
many such firms have similar  and often more established  relationships with our competitors 
these systems integrators may not be able to provide the level and quality of service required to meet the needs of our customers 
if we are unable to develop and maintain effective relationships with systems integrators  or if they fail to meet the needs of our customers  our business could be adversely affected 

table of contents the market for our technology and services is competitive and we may not have the resources required to compete effectively 
the market for our technology is relatively new and therefore subject to rapid and significant change 
while we believe our technology is more comprehensive than and superior to that of our competitors  we cannot assure you of the success of our strategy going forward 
our competitors may succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective than our software  which could render our products obsolete and noncompetitive 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  more developed infrastructures  greater brand recognition  international presence and more established relationships in the industry than we have 
as a result  some of our competitors may be able to develop and expand their technology offerings more rapidly  adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more quickly  take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily  achieve greater economies of scale  devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their technology and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can 
some of our competitors have lower priced offerings and offer point solutions that may be easier to sell and demonstrate to prospective customers 
in addition  certain large competitors may be able to distribute their software products at minimal cost or free of charge to customers 
furthermore  the open source community may develop competing software products which could erode our market share and force us to lower our prices 
our competitors include large software and systems companies as well as small  privately held companies 
because some of our current competitors have pre existing relationships with our current and potential customers  we might not be able to achieve sufficient market penetration to achieve or sustain profitability 
these existing relationships can also make it difficult for us to obtain additional customers due to the substantial investment that these potential customers might have already made based on our competitors technology 
furthermore  our competitors may be able to devote substantial resources aimed at preventing us from establishing or enhancing our customer relationships 
our competitors and other companies may form strategic relationships with each other to compete with us 
these relationships may take the form of strategic investments  joint marketing agreements  licenses or other contractual arrangements  any of which may increase our competitors ability to address customer needs with their product offerings 
our competitors may consolidate with one another or acquire other technology providers  enabling them to more effectively compete with us 
this consolidation could affect prices and other competitive factors in ways that could impede our ability to compete successfully and harm our business 
because our success depends on our proprietary technology  if third parties infringe our intellectual property or if we are unable to rely upon the legal protections for our technology  we may be forced to expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we have a number of pending patent applications  and we currently rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  trade secret and other laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
these legal protections afford only limited protection  and our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
our intellectual property may be subject to even greater risk in foreign jurisdictions  as the laws of many countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property  our competitive position may suffer 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and may lose our competitive position in the market before we are able to ascertain any such infringement 
in addition  competitors may design around our proprietary technology or develop competing technologies 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to 
table of contents defend against claims of infringement 
any such litigation could result in significant costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of senior management 
other companies  including our competitors  may obtain patents or other proprietary rights that could prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products 
as a result  we may be found to infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
intellectual property litigation or claims could force us to do one or more of the following engage in costly litigation and pay substantial damages  stop licensing technologies that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  terminate existing contracts with customers or with channel partners  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and redesign our technology and products  if feasible 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
in addition  any of these could have the effect of increasing our costs and reducing our revenue 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
our business will suffer if we do not enhance our products or introduce new products and upgrades to meet changing customer requirements 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapid technological change  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
any delays in responding to these changes and developing and releasing enhanced or new products and upgrades could hinder our ability to retain existing and obtain new customers 
in particular  our technology is designed to support a variety of hardware and software products that we believe to be proven and among the most widely used 
we cannot be certain  however  that present and future customers will continue to use these products 
even if they do  new versions of these products are likely to be released and we will need to adapt our technology to these new versions 
we must  therefore  constantly modify and enhance our technology to keep pace with changes made to our customers hardware and software configurations 
if we fail to promptly modify or enhance our technology in response to evolving customer needs and demands  fail to introduce new products and upgrades or fail to fully develop our new product offerings  our technology may not achieve widespread acceptance and could become obsolete  which would significantly harm our business 
as we introduce new products or technologies into existing customer architectures  we may experience performance problems associated with incompatibility among different versions of hardware  software and networking products 
to the extent that such problems occur  we may face adverse publicity  loss of sales  and delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
the information technology automation software market is relatively new  and our business will suffer if the market does not develop as we expect 
the market for our products and services is relatively new and may not grow or be sustainable 
potential customers may choose not to purchase automation software from a third party provider due to concerns about security  reliability  cost or system compatibility 
it is possible that our products may never achieve broad market acceptance 
in addition  we have not yet sold or deployed our software on the scale that is anticipated in the future 
we will incur operating expenses based to an extent on anticipated revenue trends that are difficult to predict given the recent emergence of the information technology automation software market 
if this market does not develop  or develops more slowly than we expect  we may not achieve significant market acceptance for our software  our rate of revenue growth may be constrained and our operating results may suffer 

table of contents in addition  implementation of our products may be difficult  costly and time consuming 
customers could become dissatisfied with our products if implementation requires more time  expense or personnel than they expected 
additionally  we may be unable or choose not to bill our customers for the time and expenses incurred in connection with these implementation issues  which would adversely affect our operating results 
as part of the implementation  our products must integrate with many of our customers existing computer systems and software programs  which can also be time consuming and expensive and could lead to customer dissatisfaction and increased expenses 
we rely on third party software to develop and deliver our products to our customers  and the loss of access to this software could harm our business 
as part of our normal operations in connection with the development and delivery of our software  we license software from third party commercial vendors 
these products may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
the loss of these products could result in delays in the sale of our software until equivalent technology  if available  is identified  procured and integrated  and these delays could result in lost revenue 
further  to the extent that we incorporate these products into our software and the vendors from whom we purchase these products increase their prices  our gross margins could be negatively impacted 
defects in our products or claims asserted against us could result in the loss of customers  a decrease in revenue  unexpected expenses  loss of competitive market share and liability claims 
our products depend on complex software  both internally developed and licensed from third parties 
also  our customers may use our products with other companies products that also contain complex software 
if our software does not meet performance requirements  our customer relationships will suffer 
complex software often contains errors and is susceptible to computer viruses 
any failure or poor performance of our software or the third party software with which it is integrated could result in delayed market acceptance of our software products  delays in product shipments  unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to identify the source of errors or to correct errors  damage to our reputation  and liability claims 
although our agreements with customers contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  these provisions may not be effective to the extent warranty exclusions or similar limitations of liability are unenforceable 
in addition  the extent of these limitations may require negotiation 
if any claim is made against us  we may be required to expend significant cash resources in defense and settlement of the claim 
we may require additional capital to fund our operations  and we may be unable to obtain additional financing 
we believe that our current cash balances  including cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
however  if we need to raise additional capital in the future  we cannot be sure that we will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
if our licensing revenues do not meet our expectations  if we encounter unforeseen expenses or if our business plan changes  we may require additional debt or equity financing after months 
if existing or potential customers perceive that our cash balances are inadequate to support our operations  they may choose not to continue licensing our software 
additionally  holders of any future debt instruments or preferred stock may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common stock  and any future issuance of common stock would result in dilution of existing 
table of contents stockholders equity interests 
any debt financing we raise could involve substantial restrictions on our ability to conduct our business and to take advantage of new opportunities 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms or at all  our business and financial results may suffer 
our revenue and operating results will be highly dependent upon our ability to provide high levels of customer satisfaction 
we provide technical support to our customers pursuant to contracts that are renewable annually 
our customers willingness to renew their maintenance and support agreements will depend in large part on our ability to provide high levels of customer service 
if we fail to provide the level of support demanded by our customers  these customers may not renew their maintenance and support agreements  which could have a material adverse impact on our revenue and operating results 
the rates we charge our customers for our opsware automation software may decline over time  which would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial results 
as our business model gains acceptance and attracts the attention of additional competitors  we may experience pressure to decrease the fees we charge for our opsware system software  which could adversely affect our revenue and our gross margins 
if we are unable to sell our software at acceptable prices  or if we fail to offer additional products with sufficient profit margins  our revenue growth could slow  our margins may not improve and our business and financial results could suffer 
if we are unable to retain our executive officers and key technical personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our objectives 
our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance of our key employees  all of whom are employed on an at will basis 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key technical employees  in particular  marc l 
andreessen  our chairman  benjamin a 
horowitz  our president and chief executive officer  or timothy a 
howes  our chief technical officer and executive vice president of development  or if one or more of them decides to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our business objectives 
our business will suffer if we are unable to retain our highly qualified employees 
our future success depends on our ability to retain our highly qualified technical  sales and managerial personnel 
we have completed several restructuring programs  which resulted in significant workforce reductions 
as a result  employee morale may have been adversely affected  and it may be more difficult to retain our highly qualified employees or recruit new employees 
our failure to retain our qualified personnel could seriously disrupt our operations and increase our costs by forcing us to use more expensive outside consultants and by reducing the rate at which we can increase revenue 
if our customer base and revenue grow  we may need to hire additional qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel can be intense  and we may not be able to attract  train  integrate or retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel if we need to do so in the future 
important components of the compensation of our personnel are stock options and restricted stock  which typically vest over a four year period 
we may face significant challenges in retaining our employees if the value of our stock declines 
to retain our employees  we expect to continue to grant new options subject to vesting schedules  which will be dilutive to our stockholders 
a large number of our employees hold options at higher exercise prices than the price at which our common stock is currently trading 
if our stock price does not increase in the future  we may need to exchange options for new options or restricted stock  issue new options or grant additional shares of stock to motivate and retain our employees 
to the extent we issue additional options or shares of restricted stock  existing stockholders will be diluted 
furthermore  potential changes in practices 
table of contents regarding accounting for stock plans could result in significant accounting charges  which could raise our costs and impair our ability to use stock options for compensation purposes 
our stock price has been volatile and could decline 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past  will likely continue to fluctuate in the future and may decline 
the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies 
delays in closing sales or completing installations could result in material variations in our quarterly results and quarter to quarter growth in the foreseeable future 
this could result in greater volatility in our stock price 
in addition  our stock is thinly traded and  therefore  our stock price can swing significantly on low trading volume 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are variations in our quarter to quarter operating results  the loss of any of our significant customers or their failure to renew existing contracts  announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts  new or enhanced products or services  acquisitions  distribution partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in our financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts following our business  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  changes in economic and capital market conditions for companies in our sector  changes in the enterprise software markets  changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors  changes in business or regulatory conditions  interest rates and other factors affecting the capital markets  the trading volume of our common stock  and the occurrence of any of the adverse events discussed elsewhere in these risk factors 
we are a defendant in an arbitration action brought by qwest communications corporation and a cross defendant in an action brought by knight ridder digital and these litigations could harm our business whether or not determined adversely 
on july   we received notice that qwest communications corporation filed a demand for arbitration under the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association  claiming that we have breached our amended and restated ethernet collocation internet access service agreement  amended and restated reseller agreement and confidentiality agreement we entered into with qwest in fiscal qwest is seeking monetary damages  title to certain items of equipment and declaratory relief 
under the amended and restated ethernet collocation internet access service agreement we received a million non refundable prepayment from qwest in fiscal in consideration for providing services in connection with the provisioning and maintaining of three of qwest s data centers and the migration of our managed services business operations into these three data centers 
the prepayment received from qwest was originally included in deferred revenue and the residual balance as of january  has since been reclassified to accrued data center facility costs 
we believe that we have not breached any of the agreements and will defend ourselves vigorously 
however  the outcome of arbitration is inherently uncertain and there can be no assurance that we will not be materially affected 
in addition  we anticipate that we will incur ongoing expenses in connection with this arbitration 

table of contents on march   eds filed suit against knight ridder digital  a former customer of ours that was transferred to eds as part of the sale of our managed services business 
on march   we received notice that knight ridder digital filed a cross complaint against both eds and us in the superior court of california  county of santa clara  alleging in part that we breached our customer service agreement with knight ridder digital by assigning the agreement to eds 
the cross complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages and asks for certain equitable relief 
we believe that we have not breached the customer service agreement and will defend ourselves vigorously 
on march   we filed a cross complaint against knight ridder digital alleging theft of trade secrets and breach of contract  among other claims  and we joined in eds s then pending motion for a preliminary injunction 
the hearing on that motion is set for may  on april   we entered into a stipulation and order with eds and knight ridder digital limiting knight ridder digital s use of certain intellectual property pending that hearing 
the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that we will not be materially affected 
we anticipate that we will incur ongoing litigation expenses in connection with this litigation and believe that eds is obligated to indemnify us for these expenses pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement 
in the future  we may be subject to other lawsuits 
any litigation  even if not successful against us  could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and other resources away from the operation of our business 
insiders have substantial control over us and this could delay or prevent a change in control and may negatively affect your investment 
as of april   our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially own  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring control over us and could affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  the interests of those holding this concentrated ownership may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders  and  accordingly  they could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider 
we have implemented anti takeover provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions include classifying our board of directors into three groups so that the directors in each group will serve staggered three year terms  which would make it difficult for a potential acquirer to gain immediate control of our board of directors  authorizing the issuance of shares of undesignated preferred stock without a vote of stockholders  prohibiting stockholder action by written consent  and limitations on stockholders ability to call special stockholder meetings 
substantial sales of our common stock could depress our stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
as of april   we had  shares of common stock outstanding 
in connection with the repurchase of our senior discount notes  we issued  shares of our common stock to morgan stanley co 
incorporated and registered those shares for resale with the securities and exchange commission 
the subsequent sales of these shares could depress our stock price 
approximately million of our outstanding shares continue to be held by venture capital firms that have not yet distributed their shares to their limited partners 
if these venture capital firms were to distribute their shares to their limited partners  the subsequent sale of shares by those limited partners could depress our stock price

an increase or decrease in interest rates would not significantly increase or decrease interest expense on our debt obligations due to the fixed nature of our debt obligations 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since we primarily invest in short term investments 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in less than million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk 
as we expand into foreign markets  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets we plan to target 
the majority of our sales are currently made in us dollars and a strengthening of the dollar could make our services less competitive in the foreign markets we may target in the future
