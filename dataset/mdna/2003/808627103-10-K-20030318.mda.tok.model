item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and related financial data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a specialty pharmaceutical company that markets and sells brand name prescription products 
we focus on the treatment of cardiovascular  obstetrical and gynecological  pediatric and gastroenterological conditions and disorders 
our strategy is to acquire or license pharmaceutical products that other companies do not actively market and that we believe have high sales growth potential  are promotion sensitive and complement our existing products 
in addition  we intend to develop new patentable formulations  use new delivery methods and seek regulatory approval for new indications of existing drugs 
we may also acquire businesses with complementary products or development pipelines as well as late stage development products consistent with our therapeutic focus 
since january   we have acquired or licensed products from astrazeneca  aventis  bayer  elan  pfizer  sanofi synthelabo and wyeth 
these acquisitions have included the following sular  a hypertension product acquired in  furadantin  a pediatric urinary tract infection product acquired in  the prenate line of prenatal vitamins acquired in  ponstel  a product for the treatment of pain and painful menstruation acquired in  nitrolingual pumpspray  a product for the treatment of acute angina acquired in  and the robinul line of products  an adjunctive therapy for the treatment of peptic ulcers  acquired in during  we acquired and began to sell sular  an antihypertensive prescription medication 
sales of sular during were below our expectations 
also during  we experienced erosion of sales of our prenate gt and tanafed brands due to competition from knock off products 
results of operations years ended december  and december  net revenues were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  net revenues for are comprised of net revenues from products sales  a reduction in the recorded liability for estimated future returns of our ponstel and cognex products and related increase in net revenues  and an accrual for estimated future returns of our tanafed suspension products and related decrease in net revenues 
net revenues for have no comparable adjustments for changes in estimates of liabilities for future product returns 
in millions net revenue from product sales reduction of product returns accrual accrual for tanafed net revenues net revenues from product sales increased million  or  over the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  net revenues from product sales of existing products namely  all of the company s products other than those launched or acquired after december  decreased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is due to lower net sales of tanafed suspension and our non promoted cognex and cough and cold products  partially offset by an increase in net sales of the robinul line and nitrolingual pumpspray 
net revenues from sales of products launched or acquired after december  were million for the year ended december  we acquired the prenate line in august  furadantin in december and sular in march we launched the tanafed line extensions  tanafed dm  tanafed dp and tanafed dmx in january  september and september  respectively 
according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data  new and total prescriptions of sular for the quarter ended december  increased and  respectively  compared to the quarter ended september  according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data  new and total prescriptions of sular decreased and  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   while new and total prescriptions of sular decreased and  respectively  for the quarter ended december   compared to the quarter ended december  we continue to manage the levels of trade inventories of sular 
wholesalers who purchase our products increased the levels of trade inventories significantly in october and november of  presumably in anticipation of future price increases 
we plan to reduce our shipments of sular and thereby seek to reduce the levels of trade inventories of sular in the first quarter of net revenues of sular by the company in since its acquisition in march were approximately million 
net revenues of the pediatric and ob gyn franchise products  which include the prenate line  the tanafed line  furadantin and ponstel  were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  we experienced erosion of sales of our tanafed suspension and tanafed dm line of products during due to increased competition from knock off products resulting from pharmacists substituting such knock off products for prescriptions of our tanafed suspension and tanafed dm line of products 
in response to the knock off products  we launched two line extensions  tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  in september in january we were issued a us patent that contains claims which protect tanafed dm  tanafed dp and tanafed dmx against knock off products 
when we launched tanafed dp and tanafed dmx in september  our goal was to capture of the new prescriptions in their respective market niches by the end of we have exceeded our goal for tanafed dmx but did not achieve our goal for tanafed dp 
according to ims health s npa plus data  tanafed dmx captured of the weekly dispensed new prescriptions for products including tanafed dm  tanafed dm knock off products and tanafed dmx for the week ending december  over the same period  tanafed dp captured of the weekly dispensed new prescriptions for products including tanafed suspension  tanafed suspension knock off products and tanafed dp according to ims health s npa plus data 
total dispensed prescriptions of the tanafed line increased for the quarter ended december   compared to the quarter ended december  according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data 
we acquired the prenate line in august  introduced prenate gt in september and experienced erosion of sales of the products included in our prenate line during due to increased competition from knock off products resulting in pharmacists substituting such knock off products for prescriptions of our prenate line of products 
total dispensed prescriptions of prenate gt increased for the quarter ended december  as compared to the quarter ended september  the substitution rates  as measured by new dispensed prescriptions captured by prenate gt and knock off products  were for the quarter ended september  and for the quarter ended december  source ims health s national prescription audit plus data 
according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data  total prescriptions of our ponstel and robinul products each increased and  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  total prescriptions decreased for ponstel and increased for robinul for the quarter ended december  as compared to the quarter ended september  we believe this slowing in growth in the fourth quarter of was due to the reduced levels of promotion of these products caused by the launch of the tanafed line extensions during the second half of we have subsequently balanced and refocused our selling approach to all of the promoted products for we do not report independent market data on prescriptions of nitrolingual pumpspray because we believe such data does not capture prescriptions from some of the non retail channels 
sales of nitrolingual pumpspray continue to increase 
however  these sales in were approximately below our goals primarily in the second and third quarter of because of the increased focus of our sales force on the launch of sular during these quarters 
total prescriptions of our non promoted products decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  according to ims health national prescription audit plus data 
the most significant portion of this decline occurred in the quarter ended december  in addition  we experienced greater rates of returns for certain of our non promoted products in the quarter ended december   which significantly reduced fourth quarter net sales of these products 
because sales of the company s non promoted products are seasonal to the cough and cold seasons  the absolute dollar impact of these trends was more pronounced in the fourth quarter than in earlier periods 
we plan to compensate for this decline in revenues by acquiring new products and increasing sales of our existing actively promoted products 
in connection with the acquisition of rights for robinul  ponstel  cognex  prenate  furadantin and sular we assumed certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the respective acquisition dates  we estimated the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and included that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we periodically review the estimated liability 
generally  no adjustment is made to the reserve until two to three years subsequent to the acquisition due to the lag time between when a product is sold and when it is returned 
during we determined that the established reserves for robinul  ponstel and cognex were in excess of the currently expected returns 
as a result of the revised estimate  we reduced the liability and increased net revenues by million during in december  we also determined that the established reserve for sular was insufficient compared to expected future returns 
as a result  the estimate for assumed liabilities was increased by million 
as a result of our launch of tanafed dp and tanafed dmx  we anticipated higher than normal returns of tanafed suspension 
as of december   we estimate that additional returns will total approximately million and have provided for this amount as a deduction of revenue 
cost of revenues for were million and was comprised of cost of revenues from product sales of million as increased by an allowance for obsolete inventory for existing tanafed suspension and prenate gt inventory totaling million due to the introduction of product line extensions in the third quarter of and decreased sales rates 
costs of revenues for the year ended december  of million do not include a comparable allowance for obsolete inventory 
in millions cost of revenues from product sales charge for prenate gt obsolescence 
charge for tanafed suspension obsolescence total cost of revenues cost of revenues from product sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  gross margin  defined as net revenue from product sales less cost of revenues from product sales as a percentage of net revenue from product sales  was compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from the change in product sales mix and sular having a lower gross margin as compared to our other products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues from product sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  selling related expenses increased due to increased royalty expense due to higher net revenues of our nitrolingual pumpspray  robinul and zebutal products on which we pay royalties  the expansion of our sales force in april  and higher training and marketing cost related to the launch of furadantin  sular  tanafed dp  tanafed dm and tanafed dmx during selling expenses also increased due to the outside commission and co promotion expenses paid to professional detailing  inc pdi for our prenate co promotion and the new sular  nitrolingual pumpspray and robinul co promotion which began in the second quarter of general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased due to increased support staff and operating expenses at our corporate headquarters  higher insurance costs  and higher state and local tax expense 
during we recorded estimated expenses for state and local taxes associated with prior periods of million 
we have not yet settled the amount of our obligations for such taxes 
these increased expenses were partially offset by lower bad debt expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher amortization expense related to the acquisition of prenate in august  furadantin in december  and sular in march as well as increased depreciation expense for new furniture  computer equipment and leasehold improvements at our new corporate headquarters 
research and development expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  research and development expenses were primarily related to the robinul line extension development project 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of the amortization of deferred financing costs and other interest expenses associated with the credit facility obtained on march  to finance the acquisition of sular 
we expensed million million net of taxes of remaining debt fees related to the retirement of our term loan on april  that were recorded as an extraordinary item 
we repaid all indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility in the second quarter of and terminated the credit facility in july interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily the result of the reduced amount of cash invested as we used the cash proceeds from our offering for the prenate  furadantin  and sular acquisitions 
most of the cash proceeds from our offering were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility obtained to finance the sular acquisition in income taxes were provided for at a rate of for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
years ended december  and december  net revenues increased million  or  over the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  the increase in sales for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased unit sales of our key products tanafed suspension  robinul  nitrolingual pumpspray and ponstel 
according to ims health s national prescription audit plus data  total prescriptions of tanafed suspension  robinul and robinul forte and ponstel increased  and  respectively 
while we do not report independent market data on prescriptions of nitrolingual pumpspray because we believe such data does not capture prescriptions from some of the non retail channels  unit sales of nitrolingual pumpspray also increased substantially 
our operating results for the year ended december  include net sales of prenate advance and prenate gt since august the year ended december  does not include any net sales of furandantin or sular 
prior to our acquisitions of the prenate line  furadantin and sular  the prenate line had us net sales of million for the period january  through august  furadantin had us net sales of million in calendar year and sular had us net sales of million in calendar year we began to sell nitrolingual pumpspray in february and ponstel in april cost of revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gross margin for each of the years ended december  and december  was 
gross margin for the year ended does not include the impact of furadantin and sular 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  to for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in selling related expense increased in due to higher commission  royalty and product sampling expense as a result of increased sales and higher advertising  promotion  consulting and market research reporting costs associated with the launch of prenate gt in september selling expense also increased in due to additional commissions under our co promotion agreements with pdi and otsuka for prenate gt and nitrolingual pumpspray  respectively 
general and administrative expense increased for the year ended december  due to additions to our management team and support personnel  and higher insurance costs due to increased insurance coverage 
also included in the expense were one time charges of approximately million for severance to a departing officer as well as approximately million of lease abandonment costs incurred in connection with our move to a new facility 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from higher amortization expense related to the acquisition of furadantin on december   the prenate line on august   ponstel on april   cognex on june  and increased depreciation expense for furniture  computer equipment and leasehold improvements at our corporate headquarters 
research and development expense increased million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was the result of interest earned on the proceeds of our follow on offering that we completed in may income taxes were provided for at a rate of in compared to in the decrease is primarily due to state income tax structuring initiatives 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements arise from debt service  working capital requirements  product development activities and funding of acquisitions 
we have met these cash requirements through cash from operations  borrowings for product acquisitions and the issuance of common stock 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
this primarily resulted from increased net income plus increased non cash expenses and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by increases in inventories  accounts receivable  samples  other prepaid expenses and other assets 
in our tax liability was reduced by million due to the exercise of non qualified stock options by employees 
our purchase of inventory impacts our liquidity 
during  we expect to invest cash in the purchase of inventory and expect we will also experience growth in our accounts receivable 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash we expect to generate from our operations and availability under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund these working capital requirements  at least for the next twelve months 
however  in the event that we make significant acquisitions in the future  we may need to raise additional funds through additional borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
while some of our supply agreements contain minimum purchase requirements  we believe our requirements for inventory should exceed the minimum purchase agreements in research and development expense are expected to be between million and million in due to continued development work on our proposed robinul line extension and other line extensions for our currently marketed products 
these expenses are discretionary and will be funded by existing cash and cash generated from operations 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities in resulted primarily from the company s march purchase of sular from astrazeneca and bayer for million 
in addition  we purchased million of property and equipment in our business strategy includes the acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products that we believe represent attractive growth opportunities for us in the future 
while we are not currently a party to any such agreements  we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
subject to our liquidity and capital resources at any particular time  we may incur commitments in the future to acquire or license pharmaceutical products 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in was primarily the result of our follow on offering and the exercise of stock options by employees that together provided net proceeds of million 
this amount was reduced by capitalized financing costs of million we incurred under a senior secured credit facility we obtained on march  this facility consisted of a million term loan and a million revolving loan which we used to fund the purchase of sular and some of our working capital requirements 
we borrowed million under the term loan facility and million under the revolving loan facility 
we completed a follow on offering of our common stock on april  in the offering  we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
proceeds from the offering were used to repay all of the debt incurred under our senior secured credit facility 
we voluntarily terminated this credit facility without penalty in july on february   we entered into a credit agreement for a million senior secured revolving credit facility with various lenders and lasalle bank national association  as administrative agent 
subject to the satisfaction of certain borrowing base requirements  we may from time to time borrow monies under the revolving facility for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
borrowings are secured by substantially all of our assets 
borrowings bear interest at our option at the base rate in effect from time to time plus an applicable margin or the eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin will vary dependent upon our leverage ratio in effect from time to time 
as of february   we have no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
the revolving facility matures on february  fees payable under the revolving facility include a one time commitment fee of of the stated amount of the facility  an unused commitment fee based on funds committed but not borrowed under the revolving facility at rates which vary dependent upon our leverage ratio in effect from time to time and letter of credit fees equal to per annum of the face amount of letters of credit issued and outstanding under the revolving facility 
the revolving facility may be prepaid from time to time or terminated at our discretion without penalty 
the revolving loan contains various restrictive covenants  including covenants relative to maintaining financial ratios and earnings levels  limitations on acquisitions  dispositions  mergers and capital expenditures  limitations on incurring additional indebtedness and a prohibition on payment of dividends and certain issuances of our capital stock 
contractual obligations in december  we entered into a lease agreement for a new facility 
in april  we moved into this facility 
this new facility is leased under a non cancelable operating lease that expires in may the lease for the previous facility was terminated in june and we have no further obligations related to this lease 
the total rent expense was approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and respectively 
the rent expense for included a charge of approximately million for the remaining lease obligation under our non cancelable lease at that time 
we lease vehicles for certain employees under non cancelable lease agreements expiring in the total vehicle lease expense under the lease agreements for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
inflation we have experienced only moderate price increases under our agreements with third party manufacturers as a result of raw material and labor price increases 
we have generally passed these price increases along to our customers 
seasonality although our business is generally non seasonal  sales of certain products  such as cough and cold products  increase between october and march due to the cold and flu season 
we expect the impact of seasonality to decrease as we acquire or obtain licenses for products that treat chronic conditions 
however  we anticipate that the seasonality may continue to affect sales for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies we view our critical accounting policies to be those policies which are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies are as follows allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to estimate the level of accounts receivable recorded on our balance sheet which will ultimately not be paid 
among other things  this assessment requires analysis of the financial strength of our customers  which can be highly subjective  particularly in the recent difficult general economic environment 
our policy is to estimate bad debt expense based on prior experience supplemented by a periodic customer specific review when needed 
in  we reduced the allowance for doubtful accounts by approximately million and recorded the change as a reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we will continue to record bad debt expense based on prior experience supplemented by a periodic customer specific review 
if we over or under estimate the level of accounts receivable that will not be paid  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
sales deductions 
we provide volume rebates  contractual price reductions with drug wholesalers and insurance companies  and certain other sales related deductions on a regular basis 
the exact level of these deductions is not always immediately known and thus we must record an estimate at the time of sale 
our estimates are based on historical experience with similar programs  and since we have a relatively small customer base  customer specific historical experience is often useful in determining the estimated level of deductions expected to be refunded to our customers when sales incentives are offered 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales deductions  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which is typically two to three years from the date of manufacture 
beginning january   our return policy was revised to allow product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
previously  our return policy was for a twelve month window 
we changed our return policy to conform to industry standard practices 
this change to our policy did not have a material impact on the financial statements 
we believe that we have sufficient data to estimate future returns over the revised time period at the time of sale 
management is required to estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of a given product  product specific information provided by our customers and information obtained from independent sources regarding the levels of inventory being held by our customers  as well as overall purchasing patterns by our customers 
management periodically reviews the reserves established for returns and adjusts them based on actual experience 
if we over or under estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
liabilities assumed with the acquisition of product rights 
in connection with the acquisition of product rights  we assume certain liabilities for returns of product shipped by the seller prior to the acquisition date 
at the acquisition date  we estimate the amount of the assumed liabilities based on actual sales return data from the seller and include that amount in the allocation of the total purchase price 
we review the estimated liability on an annual basis 
if we over or under estimate liabilities assumed  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
intangible assets 
when we acquire the rights to manufacture and sell a product  we record the aggregate purchase price  along with the value of the product related liabilities we assume  as intangible assets 
we use the assistance of valuation experts to help us allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the various intangible assets we have acquired 
then  we must estimate the economic useful life of each of these intangible assets in order to amortize their cost as an expense in our statement of operations over the estimated economic useful life of the related asset 
the factors that drive the actual economic useful life of a pharmaceutical product are inherently uncertain  and include patent protection  physician loyalty and prescribing patterns  competition by products prescribed for similar indications  future introductions of competing products not yet fda approved  the impact of promotional efforts and many other issues 
we use all of these factors in initially estimating the economic useful lives of our products  and we also continuously monitor these factors for indications of appropriate revisions 
see also recent accounting pronouncements where we discuss the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
in in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the intangible assets we must determine the fair value of the intangible assets 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
we review intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances  indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances may include lack of promotional sensitivity  the introduction of competitive products and changes in government regulations 
if we determine that an intangible asset is impaired  a non cash impairment charge would be recognized 
inventory obsolescence 
our products have shelf lives ranging from to months 
we must estimate the amount of inventory recorded on our balance sheet that will not be sold prior to expiration 
this estimate requires analysis of forecasted demand for our products  our promotional focus  amounts of our products currently held by our customers and the impact on our products of competing products 
if we over or under estimate the amount of inventory that will not be sold prior to expiration  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
business combinations 
sfas no 
eliminates the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations 
sfas no 
is effective for any business combination completed after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized 
separate intangible assets that are not deemed to have an indefinite life will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
also establishes a new method of testing goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of that goodwill or other intangible asset below its carrying value 
the company did not have any goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets at december  or december  the amortization provisions of sfas no 
apply to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and is effective for financial periods after january  the adoption of sfas no 
on january  did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 revision of fas nos 
 and  amendment of fasb and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds  amends or makes various technical corrections to certain existing authoritative pronouncements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after may for the rescission of fas no 
and fas no 
 and all other provisions are effective for financial statements issued on or after may  early adoption is encouraged 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  with early adoption encouraged 
we are evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements 
the transition guidance and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our operating results and cash flows are subject to fluctuations from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our purchases of nitrolingual pumpspray under our agreement with pohl boskamp and our purchases of sular product inventory from bayer are made in euros 
we eliminate risks from foreign currency fluctuations after the time of shipment of product by entering into forward contracts for these purchases of inventory at the time of product shipments 
in addition  sales of cognex are recognized in the foreign currencies of the respective european countries in which it is sold 
while the effect of foreign currency translations has not been material to our results of operations to date  currency translations on export sales or import purchases could be adversely affected in the future by the relationship of the us dollar with foreign currencies 
in connection with borrowings incurred under the senior secured revolving credit facility arranged by lasalle bank  na  we should experience market risk with respect to changes in the general level of the interest rates and its effect upon our interest expense 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at variable rates 
because such rates are variable  an increase in interest rates will result in additional interest expense and a reduction in interest rates will result in reduced interest expense 
accordingly  our present exposure to interest rate fluctuations is primarily dependent on rate changes that may occur while borrowings under the senior secured credit facility are outstanding 
as of february  there was no debt outstanding under this facility
