item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we primarily receive our revenue from earned premium derived from our insurance company operations  management fees generated by our underwriting agency operations  commission income produced by our intermediary operations  investment income from all of our operations and other operating income 
our core underwriting activities involve providing group life  accident and health  aviation  london market account  global financial products and other specialty lines of business  each of which is marketed by our insurance companies and our underwriting agencies either directly to customers or through a network of independent or affiliated agents and brokers 
during the past several years  we have substantially increased our shareholders equity through issuing equity securities and through retaining our earnings  thereby enabling us to increase the underwriting capacity of our insurance companies 
with this additional equity  we increased underwriting activity across many of our lines of business  emphasizing lines of business and individual opportunities with the most favorable underwriting characteristics at a particular point in the insurance cycle 
as an insurer  we also purchase reinsurance for each of our lines of business 
we purchase different types of reinsurance in amounts we consider appropriate for each of our lines of business based upon market conditions and the level of risk we wish to retain 
market conditions improved during  and across all of our lines of business 
this improvement accelerated after the september  terrorist attack and highly publicized corporate governance failures and continued throughout with significant rate increases particularly evident in our global financial products line of business 
we plan to continue to expand our underwriting activities  in response to these hardening market conditions 
during and we acquired the following companies in transactions that were recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations and cash flows of these companies are included in our underwriting results beginning on the effective date of each transaction

included in this charge was million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our primary workers compensation line of business 
compensation expense increased to million during from million in much of this increase was due to the underwriting agency subsidiaries acquired in and late  somewhat offset by a decrease from operations sold or otherwise disposed of during late and efficiencies gained from the consolidation of certain of our underwriting agencies into our insurance company operations 
other operating expense decreased to million during compared to million in  primarily as a result of the reduction in the amortization of goodwill  operations sold or disposed of  somewhat offset by the effect of acquisitions in and late  and the goodwill impairment charge in currency conversion gains amount to million in compared to million in interest expense was million for compared to million in included in is million representing the amortization of underwriting discounts and other costs of our august issuance of convertible notes  compared to million of similar amortization in these costs were fully amortized at the end of august income tax expense was million for compared to million in our effective tax rate was in the unusually high tax rate for results from the write off related to the impairment of goodwill  which was not deductible for income tax purposes

the increase resulted from organic growth and premium rate increases in our london market account line of business  plus our global financial products line of business not previously written  offset by the decrease in discontinued lines of business 
gross written premium is expected to continue to increase in net written premium for increased to million from million in  as our insurance companies have increased their overall retentions  in addition to the effect of the changes in gross premium described above 
net earned premium also increased to million for the same reasons 
increases in net written and net earned premiums were and  respectively  before the discontinued lines of business 
increases in net written and net earned premium are expected to continue in net loss and loss adjustment expense was million for compared to million in the net loss expense included million from the september terrorist attack and million from the charge for lines of business we decided to cease writing 
because of these items and generally better underwriting results in as a result of higher pricing and improved policy terms and conditions  the net loss ratio was greatly improved at for compared to in  on substantially increased earned premiums 
the loss ratios for the continuing lines  with the exception of the specialty lines  also improved for these reasons 
the loss ratio in the other specialty lines increased as a result of some adverse development on policies  which were subsequently not renewed 
during the third quarter of  we also recorded a charge in the amount of million related to certain business included in discontinued lines 
this business was acquired as part of our purchase of the centris group  inc in and was of a type that we have not historically written 
the gross loss ratio was in compared to in the gross loss ratio was high because we recorded gross losses of million due to the petrobras production platform  million due to the september terrorist attack and million due to the total oil company loss 
additionally  in  as a result of further evaluation  we reduced our gross losses from the september terrorist attack by million and reduced the gross losses from the total loss by million 
offsetting this positive gross development was million of negative development due to late reporting of an aggregate program that we no longer write 
as the adjustments related to gross losses that were substantially reinsured  there was no material net effect 
during  we had net loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in and we had gross loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million compared to a deficiency of million in the gross deficiency for resulted from late reported loss information received during  primarily from assumed reinsurance business written by one of our insurance companies 
there was no material net effect on our earnings as that business was substantially reinsured 
the deficiencies and redundancies result from our continued review of our loss reserves with our actuaries and the increase or reduction of reserves as losses are finally settled and claims exposures are reduced 
we continue to believe we have provided for all material net incurred losses

there was million net of income tax of goodwill amortization recorded in barring future catastrophic events  we expect this trend to continue into underwriting agencies management fees increased to million for  compared to million in the underwriting agencies acquired in and late accounted for much of the increase together with organic growth  partially offset by a decrease in management fees from our other underwriting agencies as we continued the consolidation of certain other underwriting agency operations into our insurance companies 
net earnings of our underwriting agencies increased to million for from million in as a result of increased revenue and the adoption of sfas no 
 somewhat offset by the integration of certain underwriting agencies into our insurance companies 
there was million net of income tax of goodwill amortization recorded in we expect further improvement in due to our acquisitions in late and organic growth

net earnings of our intermediaries decreased to million for compared to million in there was million net of income tax of goodwill amortization recorded in compared to none in due to the adoption of sfas no 
we anticipate returning to growth in commission income in as our non affiliated business grows 
other operations the decrease in other operating income to million during from million in was principally due to the disposition or closure of certain operations during and the resultant gains totaling million from certain of those dispositions 
net earnings of other operations decreased to million in from million in for the same reasons 
period to period comparisons may vary substantially depending on other operating investments or dispositions thereof in any given period 
we anticipate new strategic investments and possibly a service company acquisition in  which would provide growth in this revenue 
corporate the net income of the corporate segment was million for compared to a net loss of million in this improvement resulted from lower interest expense due primarily to lower interest rates 
year ended december  versus year ended december  total revenue increased to million for compared to the increase in the insurance company segment revenue resulting from increased business  greater retention levels and higher investment income was offset primarily by a reduction in the underwriting agency segment revenue as we consolidated the operations of three of our underwriting agencies into the operations of our insurance companies on january  net investment income was million for compared to million in the positive effect on investment income of our higher level of invested assets was offset by a significant decrease in interest rates in during  we recorded a net realized investment gain of million  compared to a loss of million in during we recognized a million realized loss from the write down of five investments to their estimated fair market value compared to a similar write down of million from one equity investment during the loss from write downs during was offset by other gains recorded on investments sold 
during  we experienced three significant gross losses 
the largest loss was as a result of the terrorist attack on september  which produced the biggest loss to our insurance company operations in our history 
although we had no involvement in the insurance coverages of the airlines involved  we had significant exposure in our accident and health reinsurance account 
our estimates of ultimate exposure were developed through a review of policy coverages  consideration of the effect on the estimate if the attack was considered multiple events rather than a single event  and communications from our clients and producers 
we also had participations in property coverage on the world trade center and some of the surrounding buildings 
in addition  we anticipate some claims from other business written in the new york city area 
we also received some reported claims and estimates of losses for others 
we utilized this information together with known coverage and reinstatement premium information to establish our gross and net losses reserve of million and million  respectively 
a charge for the net amount has been included in our consolidated financial statements 
the other two losses were the petrobras brazilian offshore energy production platform and total chemical factory near toulouse  france incidents  which produced gross losses of million and million  respectively 
because these policies were substantially reinsured  the net losses were not material to our results of operations 
during  we recorded a charge totaling million related to lines of business that we decided to cease writing  mainly our primary workers compensation line of business 
the composition of this charge is million for loss and loss adjustment expense  million for net policy acquisition costs and million for other operating expense 
included in other operating expense is million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our primary workers compensation line of business 
the fair value of this line of business was calculated based upon the present value of future expected cash flows 
compensation expense decreased to million for from million in the decrease is due principally to the disposition of non core subsidiaries  the subsequent closing or reduction of some operations of an acquired company and efficiencies gained from the consolidation of some of our underwriting agency operations with those of our insurance companies 
other operating expense for included million from charges related to lines of business that we decided to cease writing 
excluding these charges  other operating expense in was somewhat reduced for the same reasons as compensation expense  but to a much lesser extent  and the decrease was offset by a general increase in expenses in our operating subsidiaries as business grew 
in addition  guarantee fund and other assessments increased million in compared to other operating expenses for also included a credit of million reflecting the reversal of some restructuring charges recorded during the previous year  whereas during we recorded million in merger expense resulting from an acquisition 
currency conversion gains amounted to million in compared to losses of million in interest expense was million for down from million in this decrease resulted from our use of the proceeds from our march  public offering of common stock and part of our august  offering of convertible notes to pay off our debt under the bank facility  lower interest rates and the low interest rate on our newly issued convertible notes 
income tax expense on earnings before the change in accounting was million for down from million for primarily due to the reduction in pre tax income 
the unusual effective tax rate for of  compared to for  primarily results from the charge for the impairment of goodwill  which was not deductible for income tax purposes 
net earnings before the change in accounting was million  or per diluted share  for compared to million  or per diluted share  in before the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
this decrease primarily results from the after tax loss from the september terrorist attack of million  or per diluted share  and the after tax charge for lines of business we decided to cease writing of million  or per diluted share

gross written premium growth was not our focus in  as we were able to grow our revenue simply by retaining more of the business 
net written premium for increased to million compared to the previous year  as our insurance companies increased retentions on many of their lines of business as underwriting profitability improved 
net earned premium increased to million for the same reason 
increases in net written premium and net earned premium were and  respectively  before the discontinued lines of business

the net loss ratio was for compared to in the group life  accident and health  aviation and london market account loss ratios improved  in spite of losses sustained from the september  terrorist attack  due generally to rate increases and better terms and conditions 
the other specialty lines loss ratio increased between years as a result of adverse development on policies  which were subsequently not renewed 
the discontinued lines loss ratio increased as a result of the charge related to lines of business we decided to cease writing and the september  loss 
the gross loss ratio was in compared to for the petrobras and total claims were substantially reinsured and did not have a material effect on our net loss ratio or net earnings 
the combined ratio was in compared to for the expense ratio increased in to from in principally as a result of reduced ceding commissions as we retained more profitable business 
during  we had net loss and loss adjustment expense redundancy of million relating to prior year losses compared to a redundancy of million in and we had gross loss and loss adjustment expense deficiency of million compared to a redundancy of million in the gross deficiency for resulted from late reported loss information received during these losses primarily came from assumed reinsurance business written by one of our insurance companies

this reduction in costs is offset by the increase in policy acquisition costs resulting from higher earned premium and part of the charge from lines of business we decided to cease writing 
the net loss of our insurance companies was million in compared to net income of million for the results include after tax losses from the september terrorist attack of million and the charge for lines of business we decided to cease writing of million 
underwriting agencies management fees decreased to million for compared to million in much of the decrease is the result of our consolidation of the operations of three of our underwriting agencies into the operations of our insurance companies effective january  additional decreases are due to lines of business either sold or exited and increased retentions of our insurance companies

intermediaries commission income was million for compared to million in commission income decreased due to general market conditions and less ceded reinsurance being placed on behalf of our insurance companies as they increased their retentions 
net earnings of our intermediaries decreased to million for compared to million in the decrease in net earnings was partly caused by our acquisition of the schanen consulting group  llc which was not subject to income taxes during prior to our ownership  but reflected in our historical results due to pooling of interest accounting  and less commission income as a result of the mix of business  which had a lower gross margin during the current year other operations the decrease in other operating revenue to million for from million in results principally from the disposition or closure of certain non core operations 
during  we recorded gains of million from the sale of other operating investments compared to million for the increase in gains was somewhat offset by loss of revenue included in the period related to operations that have since been closed or disposed of 
net earnings of other operations were million in up from million in for the same reasons 
period to period comparisons may vary substantially depending on other operating investments  or dispositions of such investments  in any given period 
corporate the net loss of the corporate segment was million for compared to a net loss of million in this improvement resulted from the reduction of interest expense as we paid off our debt under the bank facility by using the proceeds from the march  public offering of common stock and the august  offering of convertible notes  lower bank interest rates and the low interest rate on our newly issued convertible notes 
also included in the amounts for were the costs of the closing of some operations of an acquired company 
liquidity and capital resources we receive substantial cash from premiums  reinsurance recoverables  and management fee and commission income and  to a lesser extent  investment income  and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investments and other assets 
our principal cash outflows are for the payment of claims and loss adjustment expenses  payment of premiums to reinsurers  purchase of investments  debt service  and payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses  income and other taxes and dividends 
variations in operating cash flows can occur due to timing differences in either the payment of claims and the collection of related recoverables or the collection of receivables and the payment of related payable amounts 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit and other security such that net balances due to us are less than the gross balances shown in our condensed consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain a substantial level of cash and liquid short term investments which are used to meet anticipated payment obligations 
our consolidated cash and investment portfolio increased million  or during  and totaled billion as of december   of which million was cash and short term investments 
the increase in investments resulted primarily from operating cash flows and the million in capital contributions we made to our insurance companies in total assets increased to billion as of december  our investment portfolio includes a high percentage of liquid investments and generates a significant amount of investment income  which serves as a source of cash flow 
the average tax equivalent yield on investments was in  compared to in the weighted average maturity of our fixed income securities is years and weighted average duration of the portfolio was years  both as of december  over of our fixed income securities were rated a or better by standard poor s corporation 
the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of our portfolio will mature at any point in time 
on march   we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering at a price of per share 
net proceeds from the offering amounted to million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses and were used to pay down our bank facility 
in a public offering on august   we issued an aggregate million principal amount of convertible notes due in each thousand principal amount of notes is convertible into shares of our common stock  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
the initial conversion price is subject to change under certain conditions 
interest is to be paid by us on march and september each year 
holders may surrender notes for conversion into shares of our common stock in any calendar quarter if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter is more than per share of the conversion price per share of our common stock on the last trading day of the quarter 
we can redeem the notes for cash at any time on or after september  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes on september     and if the holders exercise this option  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  in shares of our common stock  or a combination thereof 
on september   the first repurchase date of the notes  thousand of the notes were tendered to us and we repurchased them with cash 
we used the proceeds from this offering to repay our remaining indebtedness under our bank facility  assist in financing recent acquisitions  make a million capital contribution to our insurance companies and for general corporate purposes 
on december   we entered into a million revolving loan facility with a group of banks 
at our request  the amount available under the facility was reduced to million by an amendment on june  we can borrow up to the maximum amount allowed by the facility on a revolving basis until the facility expires on december  the facility is collateralized in part by the pledge of our insurance companies stock and guarantees entered into by our underwriting agencies and intermediaries 
the facility agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which we believe are typical for similar financing arrangements 
as of december   there was an outstanding balance of million on this facility bearing interest at an average rate of on december  we filed form s with the united states securities and exchange commission  which provides a shelf registration for an aggregate of million of our securities available to be issued 
these securities may be debt securities  equity securities or a combination thereof 
on march   we sold an aggregate million principal amount of convertible notes due in in a public offering 
each thousand principal amount of notes is convertible into shares of our common stock  which represents an initial conversion price of per share 
holders may surrender notes for conversion into shares of our common stock if  as of the last day of the preceding calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock for at least consecutive trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of that quarter is more than per share of the conversion price per share of our common stock 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes on april   and if the holders exercise this option  we may choose to pay the purchase price in cash  in shares of our common stock  or in a combination thereof 
we plan to use the proceeds from this offering to pay down existing indebtedness under our bank facility  assist in financing future acquisitions and strategic investments and for general corporate purposes 
at december   certain of our subsidiaries maintained revolving lines of credit with a bank in the combined maximum amount of million available through december  advances under the lines of credit are limited to amounts required to fund draws  if any  on letters of credit issued by the bank on behalf of the subsidiaries and short term direct cash advances 
the lines of credit are collateralized by securities having an aggregate market value of up to million  the actual amount of collateral at any one time being of the aggregate amount outstanding 
interest on the lines is payable at the bank s prime rate of interest at december  for draws on the letters of credit and prime less on short term cash advances 
as of december   letters of credit totaling million had been issued to insurance companies by the bank on behalf of our subsidiaries  with total securities of million collateralizing the lines

the convertible notes have various put dates as discussed above 
the following is a summary of our various commitments in thousands as of december   all of which expire during or outgoing letters of credit  mortgage guarantee  total commitments  we have sold businesses in the past 
in connection with these sales  we have provided indemnifications to the buyers  which we believe are typical for transactions of this nature  based upon the type of business sold 
certain of these indemnifications have no limit 
it is not possible to estimate the maximum potential amount under these indemnifications as our performance under the indemnifications and our ultimate liability are based upon the occurrence of future events which may or may not occur 
we currently have a liability in the amount of million recorded for performance under one such indemnification 
this indemnification was given by a company we acquired  prior to its acquisition  in connection with a sale of one of its subsidiaries 
the principal assets of hcc insurance holdings  inc are the shares of capital stock of our insurance companies 
historically  we have not relied on dividends from our insurance companies to meet the obligations of the parent holding company  which are primarily outstanding debt and debt service obligations  dividends to shareholders and corporate expenses  but  rather  we have had sufficient cash flow from our underwriting agencies and intermediaries to meet our cash flow requirements 
the payment of dividends by our insurance companies is subject to regulatory restrictions and will depend on the surplus and future earnings of these subsidiaries 
property and casualty insurance companies domiciled in the state of texas are limited in the payment of dividends to their shareholders in any twelve month period  without the prior written consent of the commissioner of insurance  to the greater of statutory net income for the prior calendar year or of their statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
during  houston casualty company s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million and us specialty insurance company s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million 
avemco insurance company is limited by the state of maryland in the amount of dividends which it may pay in any twelve month period  without prior regulatory approval  to the lesser of its statutory net investment income excluding realized capital gains for the prior calendar year or of its statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
during  avemco insurance company s ordinary dividend capacity will be zero as a result of a special approved dividend paid in hcc life insurance company is limited by the laws of the state of indiana in the amount of dividends it may pay in any twelve month period  without prior regulatory approval  to the greater of its statutory net gain from operations for the prior calendar year or of its policyholders surplus as of the prior year end 
dividends may only be paid out of statutory unassigned surplus funds 
during  hcc life insurance company s ordinary dividend capacity will be approximately million 
we have a reserve of million as of december  for potential collectibility issues and associated expenses related to reinsurance recoverables 
the adverse economic environment in the worldwide insurance industry  the decline in the market value of investments in equity securities and the terrorist attack on september  have placed great pressure on reinsurers and the results of their operations 
ultimately  these conditions could affect reinsurers solvency 
historically  there have been insolvencies following a period of competitive pricing in the industry 
while we believe that the reserve is adequate based on currently available information  conditions may change or additional information might be obtained which may result in a future change in the reserve 
we periodically review our financial exposure to the reinsurance market and the level of our reserve and continue to take actions in an attempt to mitigate our exposure to possible loss 
a number of reinsurers have delayed or suspended the payment of amounts recoverable under certain reinsurance contracts to which we are a party 
such delays have affected  although not materially to date  the investment income of our insurance companies  but not to any extent their liquidity 
we limit our liquidity exposure by holding funds  letters of credit or other security such that net balances due are significantly less than the gross balances shown in our consolidated balance sheets 
in some instances  the reinsurers have withheld payment without reference to a substantive basis for the delay or suspension 
in other cases  the reinsurers have claimed they are not liable for payment to us of all or part of the amounts due under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
we believe these claims are without merit and expect to collect the full amounts recoverable 
we are currently in negotiations with most of these parties  but if such negotiations do not result in a satisfactory resolution of the matters in question  we may seek or be involved in a judicial or arbitral determination of these matters 
in some cases  the final resolution of such disputes through arbitration or litigation may extend over several years 
in this regard  as of december   our insurance companies had initiated two litigation proceedings against reinsurers 
as of such date  our insurance companies had an aggregate amount of million which had not been paid to us under the agreements and we estimate that there could be up to an additional million of incurred losses and loss expenses and other balances due under the subject agreements 
regulatory guidelines suggest that a property and casualty insurer s annual statutory gross written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus and net written premium should not exceed of its statutory policyholders surplus 
however  industry standards and rating agency criteria place these ratios at and  respectively 
our property and casualty insurance companies have maintained premium to surplus ratios generally lower than such guidelines 
for the year ended december   our statutory gross written premium to policyholders surplus was 
for the year ended december   our statutory net written premium to policyholders surplus was 
as of december   each of our domestic insurance companies total adjusted capital was significantly in excess of the authorized control level risk based capital level prescribed by the national association of insurance commissioners 
impact of inflation our operations  like those of other property and casualty insurers  are susceptible to the effects of inflation  as premiums are established before the ultimate amounts of loss and loss adjustment expense are known 
although we consider the potential effects of inflation when setting premium rates  for competitive reasons  such premiums may not fully offset the effects of inflation 
however  because the majority of our business is comprised of lines which have relatively short lead times between the occurrence of an insured event  reporting of the claims to us and the final settlement of the claims  the effects of inflation are minimized 
a portion of our revenue is related to healthcare insurance and reinsurance products that are subject to the effects of the underlying inflation of healthcare costs 
such inflation in the costs of healthcare tends to generate increases in premiums for medical stop loss coverage  resulting in greater revenue  but also higher claim payments 
inflation also may have a negative impact on insurance and reinsurance operations by causing higher claim settlements than may originally have been estimated without an immediate increase in premiums to a level necessary to maintain profit margins 
we do not specifically provide for inflation when setting underwriting terms and claim reserves  although we do consider trends 
we continually review claim reserves to assess their adequacy and make necessary adjustments 
inflation can also affect interest rates 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our investments 
in addition  the interest rate payable under our million bank loan fluctuates with that of the market 
any significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our earnings  depending on the amount borrowed on our bank facility 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations we underwrite risks which are denominated in a number of foreign currencies 
as a result  we have receivables and payables in foreign currencies and we establish and maintain loss reserves with respect to our insurance policies in their respective currencies 
our net earnings could be impacted by exchange rate fluctuations affecting these balances 
our principal area of exposure is with respect to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the major european currencies particularly the british pound sterling and the euro and the us dollar 
we constantly monitor the balance between our receivables and payables and loss reserves to mitigate the potential exposure should an imbalance be expected to exist for other than a short period of time 
for the year ended december   our gain from currency conversion was million compared to a gain of million in and a loss of million in on a limited basis  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts as a hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
rattner mackenzie limited has revenue streams in us dollars and canadian dollars but incurs expenses in british pound sterling 
to mitigate the foreign exchange risk  from time to time we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts expiring at staggered times 
as of december   we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
the foreign currency forward contracts are used to convert currency at a known rate in an amount which either approximates or is less than monthly expenses 
thus  the effect of these transactions is to limit the foreign currency exchange risk of the recurring monthly expenses 
we utilize these foreign currency forward contracts strictly as a cash flow hedge against existing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations rather than as a form of speculative or trading investment 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions when applying our accounting policies 
those of our accounting policies that we consider to be most significant and the estimates and assumptions we make in the application of those accounting policies are discussed below 
earned premium  policy acquisition costs and ceding commissions all of the property and casualty policies written by our insurance companies qualify as short duration contracts as defined by current accounting literature 
written premium  net of reinsurance  is primarily included in earnings on a pro rata basis over the lives of the related policies 
however  for certain types of business  it is recognized over the period of risk in proportion to the amount of insurance risk provided 
policy acquisition costs  including commissions  taxes  fees and other direct costs of underwriting policies  less ceding commissions allowed by reinsurers  including expense allowances  are deferred and charged or credited to earnings proportionate to the premium earned 
historical and current loss and loss adjustment expense experience and anticipated investment income are considered in determining premium deficiencies and the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
loss and loss adjustment expense our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are composed of reserves for reported losses and reserves for incurred but not reported losses less a reduction for reinsurance recoverable related to those reserves 
reserves are recorded on an undiscounted basis  except for reserves acquired in transactions recorded using the purchase method of accounting 
the reserves for reported losses related to our direct business and certain reinsurance assumed are initially set by our claims personnel or independent claims adjusters hired by us and subject to our review with a goal of setting the reserves at the ultimate expected loss amount as soon as possible as information becomes available 
reserves for reported losses with respect to other reinsurance assumed are recorded based upon information supplied to us by the ceding company 
our claims personnel monitor these reinsurance assumed reserves on a current basis and audit ceding companies claims to ascertain that claims are being recorded currently and that net reserves are being set at levels that properly reflect the liability related to the claims 
our actuaries  in conjunction with our claims personnel  determine the amount of our incurred but not reported reserves as well as review the reported claim reserves for positive or adverse development 
reserves are estimates and changed conditions can cause changes in the estimates 
however  we believe that our review process is effective such that any required changes are recognized in the period of change as soon as the need for the change is evident 
reinsurance recoverables offset our gross reserves based upon the contractual terms of our reinsurance agreements 
losses in our group life and accident and health  aviation  london market accounts and other specialty lines of business are recorded and paid relatively quickly 
there is not a significant amount of long tailed liability exposure in these lines of business 
therefore  reserves can be determined and recorded with a higher degree of accuracy and significant development should not be expected with respect to losses in these lines of business 
there is some reinsurance assumed in these lines of business  but  as discussed above  we monitor the assumed reported losses closely 
losses related to our global financial products line of business are reported relatively quickly but can develop over time as  especially with respect to directors and officers liability business where we write excess of loss risks  reported losses which are adjusted by the primary underwriter on the risk may not initially appear to be serious but can develop and affect our excess layer over time 
we believe that we have adequately reserved for this eventuality 
our discontinued line of business contains both direct business and assumed business 
some of the losses in this line are administered by others  subject to our review 
it is possible that there can be development in the loss reserves in this line of business as the business is in run off and some of it is subject to late reporting by those administering the claims 
we monitor these reserves carefully on a current basis and believe that they are properly set based upon the information we have at this time 
we have insignificant exposure to asbestos and environment policy liabilities as we did not begin business until and the type of business we wrote contained pollution exclusions or was not of the type that subjected us to those types of risks 
the table below shows our recorded reserves as of december  in thousands by line of business compared to the high and low ends of the reserve range as determined by our reserving actuaries 
based upon our historical reserving techniques and the fact that our net reserves have historically shown positive development  we believe that there will not be any negative development in our consolidated reserves recorded low end of high end of reserves actuarial range actuarial range lines of business group life  accident and health    aviation    london market accounts    global financial products    other specialty lines    discontinued lines    total net reserves    reinsurance recoverables we constantly review the collectibility of the reinsurance recoverables of our insurance companies and record a reserve for potentially uncollectible reinsurance 
our estimates utilized to calculate the reserve are evaluated on a current basis but are subject to change and this could affect the level of the reserve required 
we believe  based upon periodic detail reviews of our disputed and aged recoverables  that we have sufficiently provided for potential losses that are currently evident 
see also item  legal proceedings and the reinsurance ceded section contained in item  business 
management fees and commission income when there is no significant future servicing obligation  management fees and commission income from our underwriting agencies and intermediaries  respectively  are recognized on the revenue recognition date  which is the later of the effective date of policy  the date when the premium can be reasonably established  or the date when substantially all the services relating to the insurance placement have been rendered to the client 
profit commissions based upon the profitability of business written are recorded as revenue at the end of each accounting period based upon the respective formula calculation 
such amounts are adjusted should experience change 
when additional services are required  the service revenue is deferred and recognized over the service period 
we also record an allowance for estimated return commissions which may be required to be paid upon the early termination of policies 
these policies are consistent with policies that have become generally accepted accounting principles for insurance agents and brokers and with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin number entitled revenue recognition in financial statements 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on our history of earnings  expectations for future earnings  taxable income in carry back years and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets  with the exception of the benefit of certain pre acquisition tax loss carryforwards for which valuation allowances have been provided 
if there is a material change in the tax laws such that the actual effective tax rate changes or the time periods within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible change  we will need to reevaluate our assumptions which could result in a change in the valuation allowance required 
valuation of goodwill we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or sooner if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in determining the fair value of a reporting unit  we utilize the expected cash flow approach as set forth in fasb concepts statement no 
this approach utilizes a risk free rate of interest  estimates of future cash flows and probabilities as to the occurrence of the future cash flows 
we utilize our budgets and projection of future operations based upon historical and expected industry trends to estimate our future cash flows and the probability of their occurring as projected 
based upon our last impairment test  the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by a substantial margin 
other than temporary impairments on investments declines in the market value of invested assets below cost are evaluated for other than temporary impairment losses on a quarterly basis 
impairment losses for declines in value of fixed maturity investments and equity securities below cost attributable to issuer specific events are based upon all relevant facts and circumstances for each investment and are recognized when appropriate 
for fixed maturity investments with unrealized losses due to market conditions or industry related events where we have the positive intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow a market recovery or to maturity  declines in value below cost are not assumed to be other than temporary 
our policy for equity securities is to recognize impairment losses on specific securities that have had continuous material unrealized losses for more than three consecutive quarters or less  due to market conditions or industry related events 
as of december   we had gross unrealized losses on fixed income and marketable equity securities of million 
of aggregate market value compared to million 
of aggregate market value as of december  effects of recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
entitled accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued in july  and will become effective for us on january  sfas no 
will spread out the reporting of expenses related to restructurings and is a change to existing guidance 
the commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be enough to record a one time charge for most anticipated costs 
instead  companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value and the liability will be subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated cash flow 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
entitled guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 


was issued on november  the provision for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  and disclosure requirements were effective for periods ending after december  we have complied with the disclosure requirements in these financial statements and do not believe that the recognition and measurement provisions will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
fin no 
entitled consolidation of variable interest entities  which is an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
entitled consolidated financial statements addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities which have certain characteristics 
fin no 
requires consolidation of a qualifying variable interest entity when a party has a controlling financial interest regardless of whether or not the party has a majority voting interest 
fin no 
is immediately effective for qualifying variable interest entities created after january  and applicable to such entities created prior to february  by the end of our third fiscal quarter in we are currently studying fin no 
for applicability to us 
at the present time we believe fin no 
will only be applicable to one entity in which we have an investment 
we invested in a partnership  which owns a building which is rented to unaffiliated parties  as a long term investment 
the partnership is not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have a maximum exposure to loss of million with respect to this entity as a result of our investment and our guarantee of the partnership s debt 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
entitled revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  or alternatively can be applied retroactively 
eitf issue no 
addressed how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf issue no 
also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
we do not believe that this eitf issue no 
will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the issues in eitf issue no 
have been previously addressed when we adopted securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal assets and liabilities are financial instruments which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures are interest rate risk on fixed income securities and interest expense on variable rate debt  equity risk on marketable equity securities  credit risk on reinsurance recoverables and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to manage the exposures of our investment risks  we generally invest in investment grade securities with characteristics of duration and liquidity to reflect the underlying characteristics of the insurance liabilities of our insurance companies 
we have not historically used derivatives to manage any of our investment related market risks 
caution should be used in evaluating overall market risk utilizing the information below 
actual results could differ materially from estimates below for a variety of reasons  including  among other things amounts and balances on which the estimates are based are likely to change over time  assumptions used in the models may prove to be inaccurate  market changes could be different from market changes assumed below  and not all factors and balances are taken into account 
interest rate risk the value of our portfolio of fixed income securities is inversely correlated to changes in the market interest rates 
in addition  some of our fixed income securities have call or prepayment options 
this could subject us to reinvestment risk should interest rates fall or issuers call their securities and we reinvest the proceeds at lower interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in securities with varied maturity dates  so that only a portion of the portfolio will mature at any point in time 
the fair value of our fixed income securities as of december  was million and was million as of december  if market interest rates were to change  eg from to the fair value of our fixed income securities would change approximately million as of december  this compares to change in value of million as of december  for the same change in market interest rates 
the change in fair value was determined using duration modeling assuming no prepayments 
our million bank loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on this loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
as of december   we had million in debt outstanding under the bank loan 
at that debt level  the change in market interest rates would have changed interest expense by million 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding under our bank loan and our convertible notes are not subject to interest rate changes 
equity risk our portfolio of marketable equity securities is subject to equity price risk due to market changes 
the fair value of our marketable equity securities including the amounts  if any  of insurance related equity securities designated as trading securities and included in other assets as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  the balance at december  includes mutual fund securities with a value of million 
these mutual funds are invested heavily in fixed income securities but represent marketable equity securities for reporting purposes 
if the market price of all marketable equity securities were to change by as of these dates  the fair value of our portfolio of marketable equity securities would have changed million as of december  and million as of december  foreign exchange risk the table below shows the net amounts of significant foreign currency balances at december  and converted to us dollars 
it also shows the expected dollar change in fair value that would occur if exchange rates changed from exchange rates in effect at those times in thousands hypothetical hypothetical us dollar change us dollar change equivalent in fair value equivalent in fair value british pound sterling   euro  canadian dollar   see foreign exchange rate fluctuations section contained in item  management s discussion and analysis  and notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information
