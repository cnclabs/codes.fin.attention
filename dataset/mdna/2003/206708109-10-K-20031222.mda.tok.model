subscription services 
we provide our solutions as a subscription service to customers on an outsourced basis over the internet or a dedicated telecommunications connection 
we offer a variety of service offerings that are tailored to the needs of different customer segments 
large market subscription services 
we offer both highly configurable and standardized subscription services offerings that are marketed primarily to large market companies with  or more employees 
we generally offer these services on either a transaction basis  under which a customer is authorized to use our solutions based on the number of transaction reports submitted by operation of the service  or an authorized user basis  under which a customer is authorized to use our solutions based on the number of users that are authorized to submit transaction reports by operation of the service 
fees typically include a one time set up fee and recurring subscription fees for the service 
some customers of these subscription services purchase or have previously purchased an up front license for our software 
in those cases  the customer typically pays a one time set up fee and recurring subscription fees only for our hosting and application management services 
middle market subscription services 
we offer standardized subscription services offerings that are marketed primarily to middle market companies with less than  employees 
we typically offer these services on an authorized user basis 
fees typically include a one time set up fee and recurring subscription fees for the service 
license 
we license our software to customers that want highly configurable solutions that are typically installed at the customer s premises on customer furnished equipment  managed by the customer  and accessed over a corporate intranet 
we generally offer licenses for our software on either a transaction basis or an authorized user basis 

table of contents we were incorporated in and began selling travel and entertainment expense management software in fiscal in fiscal  we released a client server based edition of concur expense  and in fiscal  we released a web based version of concur expense 
this product has accounted for a majority of concur expense license revenues in every year since its release 
in october  we began offering concur expense as a subscription service  principally to mid size companies that wanted a standardized solution provided on an outsourced basis over the internet 
in december  we introduced additional outsourced subscription services  for large companies that wanted a highly configurable solution provided on an outsourced basis 
today  we refer to these outsourced subscription services as the concur expense service 
as a complement to our concur expense solutions  we began offering our concur payment solutions in may to accommodate the demand for the management of employee requests for vendor payments 
in march  we sold our concur human resources product line to mbh solutions  inc as part of our efforts to focus more on our concur expense products and services 
the transaction consisted of the sale of certain assets to  and assumption of certain obligations by  mbh solutions  inc we added concur human resources to our product offerings through our acquisition of seeker software  inc in june in july  we completed our acquisition of captura software  inc captura 
prior to the acquisition  captura was a privately held corporation that provided hosted corporate expense management solutions under outsourced subscription services and license models 
following the acquisition  captura s operations were consolidated into our operations at our headquarters in redmond  washington 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those most important to the financial statement presentation and that require the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions and or conditions  actual results of operations may materially differ 
we periodically re evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  provision for doubtful accounts and sales returns  expected lives of customer relationships  fair value of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment  provision for income taxes  valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and contingencies and litigation reserves 
we presently believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies including american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  the consensus reached in emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware eitf  the consensus reached in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  the united states securities exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  and related interpretations including aicpa technical practice aids 
we also utilize interpretative guidance from regulatory and accounting bodies which include  but are not limited to  the sec  the aicpa  the financial accounting standards board fasb  and various professional organizations 

table of contents we derive our revenues from the delivery of subscription services  software maintenance services  consulting and training services  and the sale of licensed software 
subscription revenues consist of monthly fees paid for services provided under our subscription delivery models  together with related value added services and the amortization of one time set up fees in connection with those services 
monthly subscription fees are recognized as the service is provided to the customer 
in arrangements that include only subscription services  set up fees are recorded to deferred revenue and recognized over the subscription service period 
the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are deferred and expensed over the subscription service period 
in certain subscription offerings  the subscription service period is open ended and  therefore  the date upon which the monthly fees will end is undetermined 
for these offerings  the subscription set up fees  as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  are typically deferred and recognized over the expected lives of the customer relationships  which are typically two to five years  based on the particular service offering and our experience in delivering that offering 
we continue to evaluate and adjust the length of these amortization periods as we gain more experience with customer contract renewals and contract cancellations 
based on that experience  it is possible that  in the future  the estimates of expected customer lives may change and  in such event  the period over which such subscription set up fees are amortized will be adjusted 
any such change in estimated expected customer lives will affect our future results of operations 
additionally  subscription revenues are adjusted for estimates in sales allowances on subscription revenues  which are based on our historical collection experience 
service revenues consist of fees for software maintenance and consulting services 
software maintenance services relate to software license arrangements  and include technical support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
fees for software maintenance services are deferred and recognized ratably over the respective maintenance terms  which are typically one year 
consulting services consist of system implementation and integration  planning  data conversion  training  and documentation of procedures 
consulting service fees are primarily billed and recognized as revenue on a time and materials basis 
in some instances  we sell our consulting services under milestone or fixed fee contracts  and in such cases  consulting revenues are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
additionally  service revenues are adjusted for estimates in sales allowances on service revenues  which are based on the respective historical collection experience 
in service arrangements that include both consulting and subscription services  but not the license of software  we apply the provisions of a new accounting pronouncement  which applies to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  this new accounting pronouncement provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
this pronouncement addresses how contract consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate deliverables in an arrangement 
under this new guidance  the consulting services are recognized as performed if they qualify as a separate unit of accounting within the arrangement 
the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting if they have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the subscription services  and delivery or performance of the subscription services is considered probable and substantially in our control 
we have determined that  in these arrangements  the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting and  accordingly  the consulting revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
our judgment as to whether the consulting services qualify as a separate unit of accounting may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and our results of operations 
prior to the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement  the consulting revenue in these arrangements was typically deferred and recognized over the expected lives of the customer relationships 
license revenues consist of all fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our software products 
we recognize license revenues when we obtain a contract signed by the customer  we have delivered the software  the amount of the transaction is fixed or determinable  collection is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for any undelivered element of the arrangement 
elements are deliverables 
table of contents such as products and services contractually provided for in an arrangement 
elements included in our multiple element software arrangements consist of various licensed software products and services such as software maintenance services  consulting services  and subscription services 
separate contracts with the same customer that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated together  and therefore  are evaluated as a single contractual arrangement 
in software license arrangements that include rights to multiple elements  we allocate the total arrangement fee among each of the elements using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of their fair value and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in the case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change prior to separate market introduction 
we are required to exercise judgment in deciding how to interpret the evidence of fair value to determine the arrangement consideration to allocate to a given element  and in determining whether an established price is likely to change prior to separate market introduction 
these judgments may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
in software license arrangements where we also provide consulting services  software license revenues are generally recognized upon delivery of the software  provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if we determine that the consulting services are essential to the functionality of the licensed software  or payment of the software license fees is dependent upon the performance of the consulting services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
in our judgment  our consulting services are typically not considered essential to the functionality of the software and  therefore  revenues related to software licenses are typically recognized upon delivery of the software and revenues related to consulting services are recognized as the services are performed 
if collection is not considered probable  revenue is recognized when the fees are collected 
if the fees are not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
accordingly  our judgments as to whether consulting services should be considered essential to the functionality of the licensed software  and the probability of collection and determinability of fees  may materially affect the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
if non standard acceptance periods or non standard performance criteria are required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of satisfaction of the acceptance performance criteria or the expiration of the period  if applicable 
in software license arrangements where we also provide subscription hosting services for licensed software products  a software element is only present in a subscription hosting arrangement if the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without significant penalty  and it is feasible for the customer to either run the software on its own hardware or contract with another vendor to host the software 
if the arrangement meets these criteria  as well as the other software license criteria mentioned above  then the license revenue is recognized when the software is delivered  and the subscription revenues are recognized as delivered 
the subscription set up fees therefore are recognized in full upon commencement of the subscription services 
the associated direct and incremental set up costs  such as labor and commissions  are matched with the related subscription revenues  and therefore  are treated as deferred costs and then fully expensed upon commencement of the subscription services 
subscription usage fees are recognized monthly as the service is provided to the customer 
if the arrangement does not meet the criteria above  we combine the license fees with the total subscription fees and recognize them over the subscription service period 
our judgment as to whether we meet the criteria above could have a material affect on the timing of our revenue recognition and results of operations 
portions of our revenues are generated from sales made through our reseller partners 
where we assume a majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations  we record the associated revenues on a gross basis  with amounts paid to our reseller partners being recognized as cost of sales 

table of contents our assumption of such business risks is evidenced when  among other things  we take responsibility for delivery of the product or service  we establish pricing of the arrangement  and we are the primary obligor in the arrangement 
where our reseller partner assumes the majority of the business risks associated with the performance of the contractual obligations  we record associated revenues net of the amounts paid to our reseller partner 
therefore  our judgment as to whether we have assumed the majority of the business risks associated with performance of the contractual obligations materially affects how we report revenues and cost of revenues 
our software license contracts typically include an industry standard software performance warranty provision 
we account for potential warranty claims in accordance with the guidance prescribed by the fasb in its statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
historically  we have experienced minimal warranty claims 
our ability to estimate the quantity and amount of any potential future software warranty claims requires judgment  and could have a material affect on our results of operations and financial position 
our standard software license contracts typically do not include contingencies such as rights of return or conditions of acceptance 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
in july  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software eitf 
on august   the fasb ratified the eitf s consensus 
this issue addresses whether non software deliverables elements included in an arrangement that contains software that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole are included within the scope of sop software related elements include software products and services such as those listed in sop  as well as any non software deliverable s for which a software deliverable is essential to its functionality 
if the software element that is more than incidental to the products or services as a whole is not essential to the functionality of any of the unrelated elements  the unrelated elements would not be considered software related  and therefore  would be excluded from the scope of sop in interpreting eitf  we have determined that  in software arrangements that also include various subscription services  the software element is not essential to the functionality of the subscription services 
currently  in accordance with sop  in those software arrangements that also include various subscription services  we defer and then recognize the subscription set up fees in full upon commencement of the subscription services 
the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  are matched with the related subscription revenues  and therefore  are treated as deferred costs and then fully expensed upon commencement of the subscription services 
when eitf is adopted  because we have determined that the software element is not essential to the functionality of the subscription services  the subscription set up fees as well as the associated direct and incremental costs  such as labor and commissions  will be matched with the subscription monthly revenue and recognized over the subscription service period 
the provisions of eitf will become effective for us on october  we are currently evaluating the impact that the application of this consensus will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
allowances for sales and doubtful accounts 
we record an estimated provision for sales allowances to subscription and service revenues in the period in which the related revenues are recorded 
we record our sales allowances based on historical experience  including a review of our experience related to price adjustments and credits issued 
we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables  and we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts  included in general and administrative expenses 
in estimating allowances for doubtful accounts  we consider specific receivables when collection is doubtful  as well as an analysis of our historical bad debt experience and current economic trends 
if the data used to estimate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not adequately reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and future results of operations could be materially affected 

table of contents business combinations and valuation of intangible assets 
we account for business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the cost of the acquired company is allocated to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  and any remaining amount is classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as the acquired customer base  are amortized over their expected economic lives in proportion to their expected future cash flows  while in process research and development costs  if any  are expensed at the acquisition date 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is not amortized  but instead goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and  if impaired  the value of goodwill is adjusted accordingly 
our future operating performance will be impacted by amortization of intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired company to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
impairment of goodwill and certain other long lived assets 
under sfas  we are required to test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
we have determined that we have only one reporting unit 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in a two step process 
first  we determine if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  which would indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
if we determine that goodwill may be impaired  we compare the implied fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount to determine if there is an impairment loss 
we performed our initial test for impairment as of october   the date of adoption of sfas  and the required annual test  in march  and determined in each case that goodwill was not impaired 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of the goodwill assigned to each reporting unit 
significant judgments that are required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates  and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and the impairment of goodwill  if any 
stock based compensation 
we have elected to continue to account for our employee stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as opposed to the fair value method allowed by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  no stock based employee compensation cost has been reflected in our net income loss for any of the fiscal years presented  as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this involves estimating our current tax liabilities in each jurisdiction  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as making judgments regarding our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
such judgments can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
in the event we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be made in the period such determination is made 
we recorded no income tax expense in any of the periods presented  as we have experienced significant operating losses to date  as well as assumed significant net operating loss carryforwards from acquisitions 
if utilized  the benefit of our total net operating loss carryforwards may be applied  in part  to reduce the recorded value of goodwill  as well as to reduce future tax expense 
since our utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits  which are not assured  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets 
these carryforwards would also be subject to limitations  as prescribed by applicable tax laws 
as a result of prior equity financings and the equity issued in conjunction with certain acquisitions  we have incurred ownership changes  as defined by applicable tax laws 
accordingly  our use of the acquired net operating loss carryforwards may be limited 
further  to the extent that any single year loss is not utilized to the full amount of the limitation  such unused loss is carried over to subsequent years until the earlier of its utilization or the expiration of the relevant carryforward period 

table of contents results of operations revenues years ended september  change change dollars in thousands subscription service license net revenues we derive our revenues from the delivery of subscription services  software maintenance services  consulting and training services  and licensed software 
subscription revenues 
subscription revenues consist of monthly fees paid for subscription services and the amortization of set up fees in connection with those services 
large market subscription revenues contributed approximately and of the absolute dollar increase in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively 
the acquisition of captura in july accounted for the majority of the fiscal increase in large market subscription revenues 
in fiscal  the increase was primarily a result of the increasing size of the customer base contributing to our recurring revenue stream 
middle market subscription services contributed approximately and of the absolute dollar increase in subscription revenues in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively 
these increases were primarily attributable to continued growth in our customer base for middle market subscription services  which was largely driven by growth of our indirect sales channels as our relationships with strategic partners became more established 
we have a strategic relationship with adp  under which adp markets our middle market subscription services to its existing customers and to potential new customers 
sales through this channel commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal in may  we amended our agreement with adp to transfer to adp the majority of the business risks associated with any new customers signed through this channel 
as a result  we are recording subscription revenues from new customer contracts after may on a net basis 
contracts sold prior to this amendment are accounted for on a gross basis 
this change did not have a material effect on our results of operations 
more than of new customer contracts for middle market subscription services during fiscal and occurred through adp 
we expect subscription revenues to continue to grow in fiscal as a result of the growing demand for subscription services delivered to the large market  continued development of our existing strategic relationships  and the addition of new strategic relationships 
service revenues 
service revenues consist of fees for software maintenance and consulting services 
maintenance revenues are affected by the number of new license customers added as well as the retention rate for annual maintenance contracts of existing customers 
consulting revenues are affected by implementation of our solutions for new customers and implementation of upgrades and enhancements to these solutions for existing customers 
the modest increase in service revenues in fiscal reflects an increase in maintenance revenues of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in consulting revenues of approximately million 
the modest increase in service revenues in fiscal was almost entirely attributed to increased maintenance revenues 
the growth in maintenance revenues in these periods reflects continued growth in our overall installed customer base compared to the corresponding prior year periods  as well as high retention rates of our existing customers 
the modest decrease in consulting revenues in fiscal was due in part to reduced demand for consulting services  which stemmed from a decrease in new license sales in the period 
we expect future service revenues to fluctuate based on new sales of our products and services and the related consulting and maintenance services provided  as well as the demand for upgrades and enhancements to our products 
license revenues 
license revenues consist of software license fees 
the decreases in license revenues in fiscal and fiscal reflect a trend in large market prospects to select our subscription services model  
table of contents rather than our license model  as the market demand for our outsourced services continues to grow 
we believe this trend is in part related to the market s growing acceptance of outsourced services  limited information technology capital budgets  and limited information technology resources available to manage such business critical services in a traditional self hosted license model 
we expect future license revenues as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decline in fiscal as a result of the trend in typical license customers to purchase our solutions through our large market subscription services 
international revenues 
we market our software and services through our direct sales organization in the united states  the united kingdom  and australia  and through strategic referral and reseller arrangements in the united states and international markets 
revenues from licenses and services to customers outside the united states were million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
historically  as a result of the relatively small amount of our international sales  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have not had a material effect on our operating results 
as our products and services become more widely accepted in international markets and in particular with the expansion of international functionality within our products and services  we expect international revenues to continue to grow  both in total dollars and as a percentage of total revenues 
revenue concentrations 
a substantial amount of our revenues has been derived from the sales of concur expense and related services 
revenues from concur expense and related services represented approximately   and of our total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
we anticipate that revenues from concur expense and related services will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in fiscal no single customer accounted for more than of our revenues in any of the periods presented 
cost of revenues years ended september  change change dollars in thousands cost of subscription revenues percentage of subscription revenues cost of service revenues percentage of service revenues cost of license revenues percentage of net license revenues total cost of revenues percentage of net revenues cost of subscription revenues 
cost of subscription revenues consists primarily of salaries and related expenses  server and storage fees  telecommunication charges  strategic referral and reseller fees  and amortization of related deferred set up costs 
the million increase in cost of subscription revenues in fiscal reflects a million increase in infrastructure costs  such as telecommunication and server storage fees  resulting from the addition of the captura customer base 
the million increase in cost of subscription revenues in fiscal reflects increases in various costs to support a larger customer base  totaling million 
of this amount  million related to increased infrastructure costs  primarily due to our investment in infrastructure to accommodate the current and future growth of our subscription business 
additionally  referral and reseller fees increased million as a result of the increase in sales generated through our strategic partners 
the cost of subscription revenues as a percentage of subscription revenues decreased in fiscal and fiscal primarily due to the low incremental cost incurred to host each additional new customer 
we expect the cost of subscription revenues to increase modestly in fiscal as we expect the incremental cost to support our anticipated customer growth to remain low 

table of contents cost of service revenues 
cost of service revenues is comprised primarily of the salaries and related expenses including travel and entertainment expenses associated with employees and contractors who provide maintenance and consulting services 
there have been no material changes in total cost of service revenues in fiscal the decrease in cost of service revenues in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in consulting services personnel  which was made possible by improvements in our solutions and implementation methodology that enable us to provide consulting services more efficiently 
in addition  this decrease reflects personnel reductions related to our sale of concur human resources in fiscal  as well as our company wide cost reduction efforts 
cost of service revenues  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of service revenues  may vary between periods due to changes in the level and mix of services provided as well as volatility of license sales 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists mainly of royalties for sub licensing third party software  and  to a lesser extent  the costs of manuals  media  and duplication for our licensed products 
there have been no material changes in cost of license revenues in any of the years presented 
we expect that the cost of license revenues will continue to fluctuate modestly in relation to changes in the overall demand for our license products as well as the cost for sub licensing third party software 
operating expenses years ended september  change change dollars in thousands sales and marketing percentage of net revenues research and development percentage of net revenues general and administrative percentage of net revenues acquisition and restructuring charges percentage of net revenues total operating expenses percentage of net revenues sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and related expenses including sales commissions and travel and entertainment expenses as well as allocated overhead costs  all associated with our sales and marketing personnel  and  to a lesser extent  costs of advertising  trade shows  and other promotional activities 
salaries and related expenses together with allocated overhead costs represented approximately million and million of the decreases in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these decreases were primarily due to personnel reductions that we were able to effect as a result of measures taken to improve our direct sales force s productivity and an increase in the productivity of supporting our indirect sales channels  as well as additional reductions related to our sale of concur human resources in fiscal the remainder of the absolute dollar decreases in sales and marketing expenses were attributable to reductions in costs incurred for advertising and other promotional activities 
we expect total sales and marketing expenses in fiscal to continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenues as existing subscription revenues are not expected to have any incremental sales and marketing costs 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and related expenses as well as allocated overhead costs  all associated with employees and contractors engaged in software engineering  program management  and quality assurance 
there were no material changes in total research and development expenses in fiscal the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal was primarily related to a reduction in the number of outside contractors and employees engaged in research and development  primarily due to the sale of our concur human resources product line in fiscal in fiscal  
table of contents we anticipate modest increases in research and development resources as we continue to focus on product innovation and enhancement 
however  we expect our total research and development costs to remain relatively consistent with those from fiscal  as we expect expense relating to additional resources to be offset by reductions in overhead and other related costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related expenses as well as allocated overhead costs associated with employees and contractors in finance  human resources  legal  information technology  and facilities  and to a lesser extent  the provision for bad debts 
there were no material changes in total general and administrative expenses in fiscal approximately of the absolute dollar decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was due to our company wide efforts to reduce costs  which included reductions in salaries and related expenses for employees and contractors  as well as associated overhead costs 
reductions in bad debt expense represented approximately of the absolute dollar decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal during fiscal  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase from fiscal as a result of increased public company compliance expenses  including costs of complying with the laws and regulations related to the sarbanes oxley act 
acquisition and restructuring charges 
acquisition and restructuring charges include in process research and development  amortization of intangibles  and restructuring costs 
acquisition charges in fiscal represented amortization of the acquired customer base intangible asset in connection with our july acquisition of captura 
this intangible is being ratably amortized over five years  consistent with the expected cash flows from the underlying customer contracts 
acquisition charges in fiscal consisted of a one time write off of acquired in process research and development costs totaling million  as well as amortization of the acquired customer base intangible asset 
restructuring charges in fiscal consisted of restructuring costs of approximately million related to the sale of our concur human resources product line  offset by a gain of approximately million on the sale of these assets  and a reduction of approximately million in the amount accrued for our june restructuring as a result of changes in the estimated amounts required for severance and related benefits  facilities  and product marketing commitments 
interest income and interest expense years ended september  change change dollars in thousands interest income interest expense interest income and interest expense 
the decreases in interest income in fiscal and fiscal were due to the decreases in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities upon which we earn interest  and to a lesser extent  to lower interest rates earned on our investment portfolio 
the decrease in interest expense in both fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to lower outstanding interest bearing obligations related to bank borrowings and capital lease obligations 
provision for income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes has been recorded as we have accumulated significant net losses since inception  resulting in deferred tax assets 
since our utilization of these deferred tax assets is dependent on future profits  which are not assured  we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax assets

average days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days and 
table of contents days for the quarters ended september  and  respectively  and days and days for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this improvement in days sales outstanding was primarily the result of improved collections of outstanding accounts receivable  as well as a full year of revenue recognized for captura customers in fiscal  as opposed to only two months of revenue from these customers recognized in fiscal our total current liabilities were million and million as of september  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
this decrease consisted primarily of a reduction in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  including accrued costs relating to the acquisition of captura  totaling million  or  offset by an increase in deferred revenues resulting from growth in license and maintenance revenues resulting from the continued growth of our installed license customer base

property and equipment acquisitions were lower in fiscal  compared to the corresponding prior year period  primarily due to the build out of our hosting infrastructure in fiscal however  acquisition costs paid in fiscal largely offset the decrease in purchases from fiscal cash provided by investing activities was substantially lower in fiscal than in fiscal  primarily as a result of decreased investments in and maturities of our marketable securities portfolio 
our financing activities provided million in fiscal and used million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
financing activities have consisted primarily of payments made on existing loans and capital leases  offset by the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and in connection with our employee stock purchase plan  and by proceeds from borrowings under our equipment credit facility 
in march  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank for a million equipment credit facility term i advance 
the loan and security agreement for the term i advance allowed for borrowings in the amount of actual equipment purchases made through december as of september   the outstanding indebtedness under the term i advance was approximately million  bears interest at the bank s prime rate at september   and matures in december in september  we amended the terms of the loan and security agreement to add captura as a borrower  and to include a one time additional term loan term ii advance of million  the proceeds of which were used to refinance certain indebtedness owed by captura to another creditor 
as of september   the outstanding indebtedness under the term ii advance was approximately was million  bears interest at the bank s prime rate at september   and matures in october in september  we amended the terms of the loan and security agreement to add a revolving line of credit in an amount not to exceed the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable or million  bearing interest at a rate equal to the bank s prime rate at september  
amounts under this line of credit may be repaid and reborrowed at any time prior to september  at which time all amounts outstanding under this line of credit are due and payable 
as of september   no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit 
we also added an additional equipment facility term iii advance for borrowings in the amount of 
table of contents actual equipment purchases up to million  made through september the term iii advance bears interest at a rate equal to the bank s prime rate at september   and matures in september as of september   no amounts were outstanding under the term iii advance 
this amendment also eliminated the restricted cash balance requirement of million 
in december  we financed our directors and officers insurance policy renewal 
borrowings bear interest at and mature in november as of september   the balance owed on this policy was  in january  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to one million shares of our outstanding stock over a two year period 
stock purchases under the stock repurchase program may be made from time to time in the open market based on market conditions 
any purchases will be made at the then current market prices  and repurchased shares will be retired 
no purchases had been made as of september  the following are contractual commitments associated with our long term debt  capital lease  operating lease  and purchase obligations  as of september  payments due by period contractual commitments less than year years years more than years total in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total reflects future minimum commitments under arrangements with third parties who provide hosting infrastructure services in connection with the provision of our subscription services offerings 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
in the future  we may seek additional funds to support our business needs and may seek to raise such additional funds through private or public sales of securities  strategic relationships  bank debt  lease financing arrangements  or other available means 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience additional dilution  or such equity securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms to meet our business needs  our business may be harmed 
factors that may affect financial condition and results of operations we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves substantial risk and uncertainty 
the following discussion addresses some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause  or contribute to causing  actual results to differ materially from expectations 
in evaluating our business  readers should pay particular attention to the descriptions of risks and uncertainties described below and in other sections of this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
we rely heavily on sales of concur expense solutions 
since  we have generated a substantial portion of our revenues from our concur expense subscription services and software solutions 
we believe that sales of our concur expense solutions will continue to account 
table of contents for a large portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in large part  upon the successful development  introduction  and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our concur expense solutions  and our business could be harmed if we fail to deliver the enhancements that customers want with respect to our current and future offerings 
there can be no assurance that our services and software solutions will achieve widespread market penetration or that we will derive significant revenues from sales of such solutions 
we depend on subscription services revenues  our future growth is substantially dependent on customer demand for our subscription services delivery models 
revenues from our subscription services delivery models represented of total revenues for fiscal we anticipate that subscription revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues and that our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in large part  upon the growth in customer demand for our outsourced subscription services delivery models 
as such  we have invested significantly in infrastructure  operations  and strategic relationships to support these models  which represent a significant departure from the delivery strategies that we and other enterprise software vendors have traditionally employed 
to maintain positive margins for our subscription services  our subscription revenues will need to continue to grow more rapidly than the cost of such revenues 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain positive gross margins in our subscription services delivery models in future periods 
if our subscription services business does not grow sufficiently  we could fail to meet expectations for our results of operations  which could harm our business 
in addition  the cycle for implementing our subscription services can be unpredictable because our service must be integrated with a customer s existing systems 
any delays in implementation may prevent us from recognizing subscription revenue for periods of time  even when we have already incurred costs relating to the implementation of our subscription services 
furthermore  we may experience unanticipated increases in costs associated with providing our subscription services to customers over the term of our subscription services contracts as a result of inflation  inaccurate internal cost projections or other factors  which may harm our operating results 
additionally  some of our subscription services contracts contain cancellation provisions  and  as a result  we may recognize substantially less revenue than the aggregate value of those contracts over their terms 
if a customer cancels or otherwise seeks to terminate a subscription agreement prior to the end of its term  our operating results could be substantially harmed 
we depend on services revenues  services revenues and services revenue margins may fluctuate or decline 
our services revenues represented of total revenues for fiscal we anticipate that services revenues will continue to represent a significant percentage of our total revenues 
the level of services revenues depends largely upon demand for our consulting services and ongoing renewals of customer maintenance contracts by our installed customer base 
our consulting revenues could fluctuate or decline to the extent sales of our subscription services and or software fluctuate or decline or if third party organizations such as systems integrators compete with us for the installation or servicing of our offerings 
in addition  our retention rates of customer maintenance contracts may decline in the future 
our ability to increase services revenues will depend in large part on our ability to increase the scale of our services organization  including our ability to recruit and train a sufficient number of qualified services personnel 
to the extent that our costs of operating a professional services organization increase  we may not be able to maintain our current margins in this part of our business 
we depend on software license revenues  which makes our operating results difficult to predict 
our software license revenues represented of total revenues for fiscal our licensed software is typically shipped when orders are received  so license backlog at the beginning of any quarter typically represents only a small portion of the quarter s expected license revenues 
this makes license revenues in any 
table of contents quarter difficult to forecast because they are determined by orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
moreover  we have historically recognized a substantial percentage of license revenues in the last month of the quarter  frequently in the last week or even the last days of the quarter  and we expect this trend to continue for as long as our licensed software represents a meaningful part of our overall business 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the near term  any shortfall from anticipated revenues or any delay in the recognition of revenues could result in significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
furthermore we find it difficult to forecast quarterly license revenues because our sales cycle  from initial evaluation to delivery of software  is lengthy and varies substantially from customer to customer 
general weakened economic conditions have  in recent periods  resulted in more customers restricting their total capital expenditures including expenditures for software licenses 
delays such as this can contribute to the length and unpredictability of our sales cycle for licensed products  making related revenues more difficult to predict and subjecting our operating results to greater volatility on a quarter over quarter basis 
our revenue recognition policy may change and affect our earnings 
we believe our current revenue recognition policies and practices are consistent with applicable accounting standards 
however  revenue recognition rules for software and service companies are complex and require significant interpretations by management 
changes in circumstances  interpretations  or accounting guidance may require us to modify our revenue recognition policies 
such modifications could impact the timing of revenue recognition and our operating results 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding our current revenue recognition policies 
we face significant competition 
the market for our solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
the direct competition we face depends on the market segment focus and delivery model capabilities of our competitors 
we also face indirect competition from potential customers internal development efforts and  at times  have to overcome their reluctance to move away from existing paper based systems 
our principal direct competition comes from independent vendors of corporate expense management software and services  as well as financial institutions and erp vendors that sell products similar to ours along with their suites of other products and services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  marketing  and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger total number of customers for their products and services than we do 
some of our competitors  particularly major financial institutions and erp vendors  have well established relationships with our current and potential customers as well as with systems integrators and other vendors and service providers 
these competitors may also be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  and sale of their products  than us 
in addition  we anticipate the entrance of new competitors in the future 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and change in market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
interruption of our operations could significantly harm our business 
significant portions of our operations depend on our ability to protect our computer equipment and the information stored in such equipment  our offices  and our hosting facilities against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  and other events 
we backup software and related data files regularly and store the backup files at various off site locations 
however  there can be no assurance that our disaster preparedness will eliminate the risk of extended interruption of our operations 
in connection with our subscription services  we have engaged third party hosting facility providers to provide the hosting facilities and certain related infrastructure for such services 
we also retain third party telecommunications providers to provide internet and direct telecommunications connections for our services 
these providers may fail to perform their obligations adequately 
any damage or failure that interrupts our operations or destroys some or all of our data or the data of our customers  whether due to natural disaster or otherwise  could expose us to litigation  loss of customers  or other harm to our business 

table of contents we depend significantly on direct sales 
we market our solutions worldwide to companies ranging from large market companies with  or more employees to middle market companies with less than  employees 
in the large market  we sell our solutions primarily through our direct sales organization 
we believe that there is significant competition for direct sales personnel with the advanced sales skills and technical knowledge we need 
if we were unable to hire or retain competent sales personnel our business would suffer 
in addition  by relying primarily on a direct sales model  we may miss sales opportunities that might be available through other sales channels  such as domestic and international resellers and strategic referral arrangements 
it is important for us to continue to develop and maintain strategic relationships 
we depend on strategic reseller and referral relationships to offer products and services to a larger customer base than we can reach through direct sales  telesales  and internal marketing efforts 
for example  more than of our new unit sales of subscription services to middle market companies in fiscal occurred through our relationship with adp  inc  one of our strategic reseller partners 
if we were unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or enter into additional strategic relationships  we would have to devote substantially more resources to the distribution  sales  and marketing of our products and services 
our success depends in part on the ultimate success of our strategic reseller and referral partners and their ability to market our products and services successfully 
our existing strategic referral partners are not obligated to refer any potential customers to us 
in addition  some of these third parties have entered  and may continue to enter  into strategic relationships with our competitors 
further  many of our strategic partners have multiple strategic relationships  and they may not regard us as significant for their businesses 
our strategic partners may terminate their respective relationships with us  pursue other partnerships or relationships  or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products or services 
our strategic partners also may interfere with our ability to enter into other desirable strategic relationships 
our business is difficult to evaluate 
we incorporated in and began licensing travel and entertainment expense management software in under a traditional software licensing model 
since that time  our business model and operating plan have evolved significantly 
more recently  in  we introduced our subscription services delivery models  offering our software as a service on an outsourced basis over the internet 
today  we anticipate that our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in large part  upon the growth of our subscription services 
our evolving business model makes our business operations and prospects difficult to evaluate 
investors in our securities should consider all the risks and uncertainties that are commonly encountered by companies in this stage of business operations  particularly companies  such as ours  that are in emerging and rapidly evolving markets 
there are risks associated with international operations 
our international operations  which are subject to risks associated with operating abroad  are becoming an increasingly important component of our business 
revenues from customers outside the united states represented approximately million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
these international operations are subject to a number of difficulties and special costs  including costs of customizing products for foreign countries  laws and business practices favoring local competitors  uncertain regulation of electronic commerce  compliance with multiple  conflicting  and changing governmental laws and regulations  longer sales cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  
table of contents import and export restrictions and tariffs  potentially weaker protection for our intellectual property than in the united states  and practical difficulties in enforcing such rights abroad  difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations  multiple conflicting tax laws and regulations  and political and economic instability 
our international operations also face foreign currency related risks 
to date  most of our revenues have been denominated in united states dollars  but we believe that an increasing portion of our revenues will be denominated in foreign currencies 
we currently do not engage in foreign exchange hedging activities  and therefore our international revenues and expenses are currently subject to the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
we must also customize our services and products for international markets 
for example  our ability to expand into international markets will depend on our ability to develop and support services and products that incorporate the tax laws  accounting practices  and currencies of applicable countries 
our international operations also increase our exposure to international laws and regulations 
if we cannot comply with foreign laws and regulations  which are often complex and subject to variation and unexpected changes  we could incur unexpected costs and potential litigation 
for example  the governments of foreign countries might attempt to regulate our services and products or levy sales or other taxes relating to our activities 
in addition  foreign countries may impose tariffs  duties  price controls or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade barriers  any of which could make it more difficult for us to conduct our business in international markets 
we intend to continue to expand our international sales and marketing activities and enter into relationships with additional international distribution partners 
we are in the early stages of developing our indirect distribution channels in markets outside the united states 
we may not be able to attract and retain distribution partners that will be able to market our products effectively 
it is important for us to continue to manage changing business conditions 
our future operating results will depend  in part  on our ability to manage changing business conditions  including such conditions as the general economic slowdown  reduced investment in information technology by customers and prospective customers  and reduced business travel and entertainment budgets 
if we are unable to manage changing business conditions effectively  our business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to manage our operations with reduced staffing levels may strain our management  financial  and other resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 

table of contents our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations of investors and public market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance 
if quarterly revenues or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or public market analysts  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our operating results include the evolving demand for our services and software  spending decisions by our customers and prospective customers  our ability to manage expenses  the timing of new product releases  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  the timing of execution of large contracts  changes in mix of our services and software offerings  the mix of sales channels through which our services and software are sold  costs of developing new products and enhancements  and global economic and political conditions 
in addition  due to the continuing slowdown in the general economy and general uncertainty of the current geopolitical environment  we believe that many existing and potential customers are reassessing or reducing their planned technology and internet related investments and deferring purchasing decisions 
further delays or reductions in business spending for technology could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
as a result  there is increased uncertainty with respect to our expected revenues 
our lengthy sales cycle could adversely affect our financial results 
because of the high costs involved over a significant period of time  customers for enterprise software solutions typically commit significant resources to an evaluation of available solutions and require us to expend substantial time  effort  and money educating them about the value of our services and software 
our sales cycle  which is the time between initial contact with a potential customer and the ultimate sale  is often lengthy and unpredictable 
as a result  we have limited ability to forecast the timing and size of specific sales 
in addition  customers may delay their purchases from a given quarter to another as they elect to wait for new product enhancements 
any delay in completing  or failure to complete  sales in a particular quarter or fiscal year could harm our business and could cause our operating results to vary significantly 
compliance with new regulations governing public company corporate governance and reporting is uncertain and expensive 
many new laws and regulations  notably those adopted in connection with the sarbanes oxley act  impose new obligations on public companies 
preparing for and implementing these reforms and enhanced new disclosures  requires us to incur significant additional accounting and legal costs 
any unanticipated difficulties in preparing for and implementing these reforms could result in material delays in complying with these new laws and regulations or significantly increase our costs 
our ability to fully comply with these new laws and regulations is also uncertain 
our failure to timely prepare for and implement the reforms required by these new laws and regulations could significantly harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 

table of contents we may not successfully develop or introduce new products or enhancements to existing products 
our future financial performance and revenue growth will depend  in part  upon the successful development  introduction  and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of concur expense and other solutions  and our business could be harmed if we fail to deliver enhancements to our current and future solutions that customers desire 
we have experienced delays in the planned release dates of our software and upgrades  and we have discovered software defects in new releases after their introduction 
new product versions or upgrades may not be released according to schedule  or may contain defects when released 
either situation could result in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our services and products  or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not deliver new product versions  upgrades  or other enhancements to existing services and products on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
we are also continually seeking to develop new offerings 
however  we remain subject to all of the risks inherent in product development  including unanticipated technical or other development problems  which could result in material delays in product introduction and acceptance or significantly increased costs 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop new services or products  or to introduce in a timely manner and gain acceptance of such new services or products in the marketplace 
our products might not keep pace with technological change 
we must continually modify and enhance our services and products to keep pace with changes in hardware and software platforms  database technology  and electronic commerce technical standards 
as a result  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements or introductions  or modifications by vendors of operating systems  back office applications  and browsers and other internet related applications  could harm our business 
security and other concerns may discourage use under our subscription services models 
if customers determine that our subscription services offerings are not sufficiently scalable  do not provide adequate security for the dissemination of information over the internet or corporate extranets  or are otherwise inadequate for internet or extranet use or if  for any other reason  customers fail to accept our subscription services for use  our business will be harmed 
as part of our subscription services  we receive credit card  travel booking  employee  purchasing  supplier  and other financial and accounting data  through the internet or extranets  and there can be no assurance that this information will not be subject to computer break ins  theft  and other improper activity that could jeopardize the security of information for which we are responsible 
any such lapse in security could expose us to litigation  loss of customers  or other harm to our business 
in addition  any person who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary or confidential customer information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
any general concern regarding security in the marketplace could deter customers or prospects from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential information 
our failure to prevent security breaches  or well publicized security breaches affecting the internet in general  could significantly harm our business  operating results  and financial condition 
privacy concerns are increasing  which could result in regulatory changes that may harm our business 
personal privacy has become a significant issue in the united states and many other countries in which we operate 
the united states and various other countries have recommended limitations on  or taken actions to limit  the use of personal information by those collecting such information 
for example  in  congress enacted the gramm leach bliley act  which contains provisions protecting the privacy of consumer non public personal information collected by financial institutions 
any new or existing privacy laws  if applicable to our business  could impose additional costs and could limit our use and disclosure of such information 
if such 
table of contents privacy laws were deemed to apply to us  we may be required to change our activities and revise or eliminate our services  which could significantly harm our business 
we rely on third party software that may be difficult to replace 
we rely on software licensed from third parties in order to offer some of our services and software offerings 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the loss or inability to maintain any of these licenses could result in delays in the sale of our services or software offerings until equivalent technology is either developed by us  or  if available  is identified  licensed  and integrated  which could harm our business 
our stock price has been highly volatile  is likely to continue to be volatile  and may decline 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past and is expected to continue to do so in the future  as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control  such as variations in our actual and anticipated operating results  changes in our earnings estimates by analysts  the volatility inherent in stock prices within the emerging sector within which we conduct business  and the volume of trading in our common stock  including sales of substantial amounts of common stock issued upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants 
in addition  the stock market  particularly the nasdaq national market  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of many technology and computer software companies  particularly internet related companies 
such fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
further  securities class action litigation has often been brought against companies that experience periods of volatility in the market prices of their securities 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
in july  we and several of our current and former officers were named as defendants in two securities class action lawsuits based on alleged errors and omissions concerning underwriting terms in the prospectus for our initial public offering 
in april  these lawsuits were consolidated 
this consolidated lawsuit is one of more than similar pending cases filed against companies that completed initial public offerings between and and the underwriters that took them public 
in july  we decided to participate in a proposed settlement being negotiated by representatives of a coalition of issuers named as defendants in similar actions and their insurers 
although we believe that the plaintiffs claims have no merit  we have decided to participate in the proposed settlement to avoid the cost and distraction of continued litigation 
the proposed settlement agreement would dispose of all remaining claims against us and the individual defendants  without any admission of wrongdoing by us or the individual defendants 
the proposed settlement is subject to final approval by the parties and the court 
there is no guarantee that the parties or the court will approve the proposed settlement 
should the parties and the court fail to approve the proposed settlement  we would continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
any liability we incur in connection with this lawsuit could materially harm our business and financial position and  even if we defend ourselves successfully  there is a risk that management s distraction in dealing with this lawsuit could harm our results 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to continue to attract  motivate  and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting  motivating  and retaining key personnel 
many of our competitors have greater financial and other 
table of contents resources than us for attracting experienced personnel 
we also compete for personnel with other software vendors and consulting and professional services companies 
the inability to hire and retain qualified personnel or the loss of the services of key personnel would harm our business 
we may require additional financing to fund our operations or growth 
in the future  we may be required to seek additional financing to fund our operations or growth 
factors such as the commercial success of our existing services and products  the timing and success of any new services and products  the progress of our research and development efforts  our results of operations  the use of cash in our stock repurchase program  the status of competitive services and products  and the timing and success of potential strategic alliances or potential opportunities to acquire or sell technologies or assets may require us to seek additional funding sooner than we expect 
we cannot assure you that such funding will be available on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities  the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  such securities could have rights preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders 
if adequate funds were not available on acceptable terms  our ability to achieve or sustain positive cash flows  maintain current operations  fund any potential growth  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
our ability to protect our intellectual property is limited and our products may be subject to infringement claims by third parties 
our success depends  in part  upon our proprietary technology  processes  trade secrets  and other proprietary information  and our ability to protect this information from unauthorized disclosure and use 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret  and trademark laws  confidentiality procedures  contractual provisions  and other similar measures to protect our proprietary information 
we do not own any issued patents or have any patent applications pending 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  and third parties may attempt to develop similar technology independently 
we provide our licensed customers with access to object code versions of our software  and to other proprietary information underlying our software 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly because the global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other data transmitted 
while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international presence 
over the past several years  we have made numerous changes in our product names 
although we own registered trademarks in the united states and have filed trademark applications in the united states and in certain other countries  we do not have assurance that our strategy with respect to our trademark portfolio will be adequate to secure or protect all necessary intellectual property 
there can be no assurance that our means of protecting these proprietary rights will be adequate  or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology 
in addition  there can be no assurance that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products or other intellectual property rights 
any such claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we acquire companies  products  or technologies  we may face risks associated with those acquisitions 
in the future  we may acquire companies or make investments in other companies  products  or technologies 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of our prior or future acquisitions or investments to the extent that we anticipate  or at all 
we may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for future acquisitions or 
table of contents investments  the issuance of which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
if any acquisition or investment is not perceived as improving our earnings per share  our stock price may decline 
in addition  we may incur non cash amortization charges from acquisitions  which could harm our operating results 
any completed acquisitions would also require significant integration efforts  diverting our attention from our business operations and strategy 
anti takeover effects of our rights agreement  charter documents  and delaware law could discourage or prevent a change in control of concur 
we have a shareholder rights agreement in place  under which our stockholders have special rights  in the form of additional voting and beneficial ownership  in the event that a person or group not approved by the board of directors were to acquire  or to announce the intention to acquire or more of our outstanding shares 
this plan is designed to have the effect of discouraging  delaying or rendering more difficult an acquisition of us that has not been approved by our board of directors 
in addition  there are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions in the delaware general corporation law  that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control  including the following our board of directors may  without stockholder approval  issue shares of preferred stock with special voting or economic rights  our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights  and  therefore  each of our directors can only be elected by holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock  a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by a majority of our board of directors  the chairman of our board of directors  or our chief executive officer  our stockholders may not take action by written consent  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected each year  and we require advance notice for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of our business 
these risks include primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
the company is not materially sensitive to changes in interest rates or foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we have debt instruments with variable rates of interest 
variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
we believe that such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows related to these debt instruments 
foreign currency risk 
we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue and operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not believe movements in the foreign currencies in which we transact will significantly affect future net earnings 
we considered the potential impact of a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates on the change in cash flows arising from an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates 
we believe that such a change would not have a material impact on our cash flows of financial instruments that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange risk 
derivatives 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
