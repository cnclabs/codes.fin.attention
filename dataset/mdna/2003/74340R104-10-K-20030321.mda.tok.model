heavy duty sbg revenue in increased to million from million last year

margins in the heavy duty sbg also benefited from lower warranty costs than were recorded a year ago 
the higher claims incurred in were related to a customer warranty program  which had commenced during the fourth quarter of warranty claims have now returned to historical levels 
during the fourth quarter  the company instituted a sharp production cutback in its automotive and light truck plants in order to bring inventory levels more in line with expected demand levels 
this cutback resulted in a higher actual inventory cost at year end and will translate into lower profit levels during the first quarter of as the product is sold 
the adverse impact on the first quarter could be in the range of million compared to the same period in while selling  general and administrative expense levels increased million or from a year ago  they were lower as a percentage of sales  versus in these improvements primarily reflect higher year over year sales levels and benefits generated by the branch closure actions taken in and expense levels in were million above reflecting higher bad debt provisions due to the write off of receivables from several automotive and light truck customers  which declared bankruptcy

cash payments are expected to continue through the end of the million facility consolidation charge primarily represents inventory and machinery movement  lease termination and facility exit expenses associated with the relocation of an aluminum tube mill acquired during  the closure of a heavy duty manufacturing plant in maquoketa  iowa and the closure of two automotive and light truck segment branch facilities as part of the redesign of the company s distribution system 
machinery and inventory movement costs were expensed as incurred 
cash payments are expected to continue through as a result of costs associated with idle facilities 
during the third quarter of  the company announced the closure of a heavy duty manufacturing plant in maquoketa  iowa  which produced component parts for internal use and also had some unrelated sales to third party customers 
this underutilized facility was closed in order to move the manufacturing closer to where the parts are used 
in conjunction with this closure  the company recorded a charge of million  which was included in cost of sales  related to the writedown of inventory and fixed assets to net realizable value 
in the second quarter of  million was received from the sale of assets  which had been written off during in connection with the closure of a california manufacturing facility

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives no longer be amortized to earnings  but instead be subject to periodic testing for impairment

in addition  margins  as a percentage of sales reported during the second half of  were significantly better than the first half  versus 
in  second half margin percentages were versus in the first half 
the improvement in the second half of reflects overhead cost reductions and improved labor utilization in both our automotive and light truck and heavy duty manufacturing locations and the impact of price increases 
these improvements  which were the result of programs implemented in both the automotive and light truck and heavy duty segments as part of the company s initiative programs  combined with material cost reductions and higher production levels to favorably impact margin 
in addition  gross margin in the oem segment during the first half of was adversely impacted by higher costs caused by a warranty program  which had commenced during the fourth quarter of during the second half of  costs under this program declined as the cause was corrected

accounts receivable have grown by million during the period due to higher sales levels approximately million  extended terms on the new customer business added during the year approximately million and an ongoing shift in receivables mix toward longer payment cycles with blue chip customers approximately million 
these increases were partially offset by improved collections 
the company expects that its days sales outstanding will continue to be greater than its historic norms due to the previously mentioned shift in customer payment cycles 
this increase in trade receivables represents a significant investment by the company 
while these customers generally all have high grade credit  the company will be seeking ways to improve its performance in this area 
net inventories rose million as the company was unable to offset the higher inventory levels at the end of the third quarter  caused by increased sales  extra purchases of certain difficult to obtain inventory and the west coast dock strike  through cutback actions taken during the fourth quarter 
while these cutbacks in production levels and incoming receipts of finished product resulted in a year over year improvement in inventory turns to  they also resulted in a higher cost of production which will adversely impact results in the first quarter of as the product is sold 
in december  the company contributed an additional million to its pension trust in order to reduce the impact on shareholders equity from the minimum pension adjustment 
these outflows were partially offset by funds provided from operations and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities

a portion of these funds was utilized to get accounts payable payment policies in line with vendor terms and for operations 
during  the company required million to support its continuing operations 
the net loss plus total adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash used in operating activities  which includes  among other things  depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes  the gain on the sale of discontinued operations and income from discontinued operations  required funding of million

net borrowings under the previous revolver had declined by million during the future liquidity and ordinary capital needs of the company in the short term are expected to be met from a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the loan agreement 
the company s working capital requirements peak during the second and third quarters  reflecting the normal seasonality in the automotive and light truck segment 
in addition  the company s future cash flow may be impacted by industry trends lengthening customer payment terms 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations  together with borrowings under its loan agreement  will be adequate to meet its near term anticipated ordinary capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
however  the company believes that the amount of borrowings available under the loan agreement would not be sufficient to meet the capital needs for major growth initiatives  such as significant acquisitions 
if the company were to implement major new growth initiatives  it would have to seek additional sources of capital 
however  no assurance can be given that the company would be successful in securing such additional sources of capital

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
a company s critical accounting estimates  as set forth by the us securities and exchange commission  are those which are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and often require the utilization of estimates or subjective judgment 
based upon this definition  we have identified the critical accounting estimates addressed below 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  they are based upon information presently available 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company also has other key accounting policies  which involve the use of estimates  which are further described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in item of this report 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized in accordance with the invoice shipping terms which are generally at the time products are shipped to the customer 
accruals for warranty costs  sales returns and allowances are provided at the time of shipment based upon historical experience or agreements currently in place with customers 
the company will also accrue for unusual warranty exposures at the time the exposure is identified and quantifiable based upon analyses of expected product failure rates and engineering cost estimates 
in connection with multi year agreements with certain customers  the company incurs customer acquisition costs which are capitalized and amortized over the life of the agreement 
the company also establishes reserves for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based upon historical experience  anticipated business trends and the current economic conditions 
changes in our customers financial condition or other factors could cause our estimates of uncollectible accounts receivable or the amortization periods to vary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
this requires the company to make judgments about the likely method of disposition of its inventory and expected recoverable value upon disposition 
inventories are reviewed on a continuing basis  and provisions are also made for slow moving and obsolete inventory based upon estimates of historical or expected usage as well as the expected recoverable value upon disposition 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of a business unit s long lived assets may be impaired  an evaluation of recoverability would be performed 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the business unit  associated with the long lived assets  would be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a writedown is required 
if this review indicates that the assets will not be recoverable  the carrying value of the company s assets would be reduced to their estimated fair value 
the estimates used in determining whether an impairment exists involve future cash flows of each business unit  which are based upon expected revenue trends  cost of production and operating expenses 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that those such assets will not be realized 
changes to the valuation allowance are based on the evaluation of all available evidence supporting the company s ability to utilize tax benefits prior to their expiration 
pension plans 
the company establishes and periodically reviews the assumptions used in the measurement of its retirement plans 
the discount rate will change in relation to increases or decreases in applicable published bond indices 
the return on assets reflects the long term rate of return on plan assets expected to be realized over a ten year or longer period 
as such  it will normally not be adjusted for short term trends in the stock or bond markets 
in addition  the rate of return will reflect the investment allocation currently used to manage the pension portfolio 
the company s pension assumptions currently include a long term annual rate of return  which is supported by the current portfolio allocation and published long term rates of return for similar investment vehicles 
differences between actual and assumed portfolio performance as well as the impact of changes in discount rates are actuarially calculated into the company s accrued pension costs by a third party actuary 
as the performance of the pension portfolio during and was below the actuarial assumption and the discount rate was reduced by in both years  the unrecognized component of accrued pension costs changed from a gain of million at december  to a loss of million at december  and a loss of million at december  in the future  this unrecognized loss  along with changes in any of the underlying pension assumptions  and the ongoing performance of the plan assets  will impact future funding requirements  minimum pension liability adjustments and net pension cost amounts 
inflation the overall impact of the low rate of inflation in recent years has resulted in no significant impact on labor costs and general services utilized by the company 
the principal raw materials used in the company s original equipment and replacement radiator product lines are copper and brass 
the company also requires aluminum for its radiator  charge air cooler  condenser and heater product lines 
copper  brass  aluminum and other primary metals used in the company s business are generally subject to commodity pricing and variations in the market prices for such materials 
although these materials are available from a number of vendors  the company has chosen to concentrate its sources with a limited number of long term suppliers 
the company typically executes purchase orders for its copper and brass requirements three to nine months prior to the actual delivery date 
the purchase price for such copper  brass  and aluminum is established at the time such orders are placed by the company and not at the time of delivery 
the company also manages its metals commodity pricing exposure by attempting to pass through any cost increases to its customers 
although the company has been successful in passing through price increases to its customers to offset a portion of past commodity cost increases  there is no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in raising prices in the future 
the company currently does not use financial derivatives or other methods to hedge transactions with respect to its metals consumption 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state and local laws designed to protect the environment and believes that  as a general matter  its policies  practices and procedures are properly designed to reasonably prevent risk of environmental damage and financial liability to the company 
on january   the company announced that it had signed a consent agreement with the state of connecticut department of environmental protection 
under the agreement the company will voluntarily initiate the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination on property occupied by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company over years ago 
the company also believes there will not be any material adverse impact to its financial results due to the investigation and cleanup activities 
the company also believes it is reasonably possible that environmental related liabilities might exist with respect to other industrial sites formerly occupied by the company 
based upon information currently available  the company believes that the cost of any potential remediation for which the company may ultimately be responsible will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations  or liquidity of the company 
the company currently does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations  financial condition or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations 
however  risk of environmental liability and charges associated with maintaining compliance with environmental laws is inherent in the nature of the company s business and there is no assurance that material environmental liabilities and compliance charges will not arise
