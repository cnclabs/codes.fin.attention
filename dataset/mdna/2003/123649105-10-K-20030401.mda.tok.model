in delivering world class quality services that are aligned with the clients specific business needs  the company has established long term  loyal relationships with many of its clients such as sikorsky  boeing  caterpillar  verizon  bellsouth  citigroup  merrill lynch  los alamos national laboratory  sbc  united defense  nortel networks  and at t to name a few

through international operations  the company currently provides similar services from offices in the united kingdom and india 
many of the company s clients are facing challenging economic times 
this is creating uncertainty in their ability to pursue technology projects  which had previously been considered a competitive imperative 
many clients have laid off portions of their own permanent staff and greatly reduced the demand for consulting services in attempts to maintain profitability 
this has had a direct impact on butler s revenues 
management believes that most companies have recognized the importance of pursuing leading technologies to competing in today s business climate 
however  the uncertain economic environment has curtailed many companies motivation for rapid adoption of many technological enhancements 
the process of designing  developing and implementing software solutions has become increasingly complex 
management believes that many companies today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing the initiatives they undertake 
this has had the effect of delaying or totally negating spending on many emerging new solutions  which management formerly anticipated 
in the financial review that follows  we discuss our results of operations  financial condition and certain other information 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
results of operations net sales net sales in were million  a decrease of million or compared with during  sales decreased in all of the company s segments with the hardest hit operations being telecommunication services and technology solutions 
these segments reported decreases of million and million  respectively 
net sales for for the technical group decreased by million while fleet services decreased by million 
management attributes this softness to overall economic conditions as well as hesitancy by customers to launch new capital spending programs 
net sales in were million  down from the million reported in since approximately of the company s revenues are derived from companies in the telecommunications industry  revenues were severely impacted by the well publicized decline in that sector during telecommunication services and technology solutions reported decreases of million and million  respectively 
net sales for for the technical group increased by million and for the fleet services decreased by million 
net loss income the company recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million  or per diluted share for the year ended december  and to earnings of million or per diluted share for the year ended december  the current year net loss included a million goodwill impairment charge related to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
it also includes pre tax restructuring and other charges of million  which compares with like charges of million in the prior year 
it also included a million increase in the company s reserve for bad debts 
in accordance with current accounting regulations  the period excluded any charges related to goodwill amortization 
that expense in and was million  net of tax  and million  net of tax  respectively 
therefore  on a pro forma basis  excluding both the impairment charge and the and amortization  the current year net loss of million  or per diluted share  would compare with a net loss of million or per diluted share for the same period in and net income of million or per diluted share for the same period in operating loss income the company incurred restructuring and other charges as well as a significant increase in its provision for doubtful accounts and notes specific to chief executive magazine  a related party 
the company considers these to be unusual items and separate from day to day operations 
additionally  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company ceased to amortize goodwill as of january  those expenses in and were million  net of tax  and million  net of tax  respectively 
to enhance comparability  the unaudited pro forma information that follows presents consolidated operating loss income without the events discussed above 
the unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily reflective of the operating results had these events not occurred  nor is it necessarily indicative of future results 
management believes that pro forma operating results provide additional information useful in analyzing the underlying business results 
however  pro forma operating results should be considered in addition to  not as a substitutes for  as reported operating loss income

the company evaluates segment performance based on revenues and operating profits 
the company does not allocate income taxes or charges determined to be non recurring in nature  such as restructuring and impairment charges 
unallocated amounts of operating profits consist of certain shared general and administrative services  some of which may be considered corporate in nature

the pro forma operating results for reflect a million year on year decrease in the operating profits generated by the company s telecom services business 
the company s other operating units income grew by million  in the aggregate  although there can be no assurance that any of such units growth will continue in the future 
the telecom deterioration was caused by the well publicized industry collapse  which began in mid as a consequence  telecom revenue fell by million or  on a year on year basis 
the decreased revenue resulted in a gross margin decline of more than million 
overhead reductions of about million offset approximately two thirds of the lost margin 
despite the impact of the business slow down  the telecom division maintained profitability in each quarter of in  technology solutions and fleet services achieved higher operating income than in the prior year 
operating income of the technical group was essentially flat year over year 
in each case  lower revenue was more than offset by cost reductions 
technical group s project oriented sales increased by 
that work grew to million  resulting in an operating profit increase of to nearly million 
unallocated shared services expense was also down sharply  decreasing by approximately million or as compared to the year  exclusive of the increased bad debt reserve 
on an overall basis  management s restructuring actions helped eliminate more than million in overhead expenses during the pro forma operating loss for was million loss  down from the million pro forma operating profit in the results for were representative of the conditions affecting the company s customers  its peers  as well as the us economy as a whole 
throughout the year  management sought to dramatically reduce its infrastructure to gain higher operating margins and solidify its existing client relationships while establishing new customer contacts 
the restructuring and other charges reflected these efforts and costs related to severance  the elimination of redundant facilities and equipment expenses spanning the company s lines of business  as well as excess finance charges incurred mainly due to the losses reported by the former bluestorm operation 
contributing to the decrease in profits were reduced volume and margins in the telecom operations and significantly reduced activity in the it staffing area 
the technical group recorded an operating profit of million in  compared to million in the reduction was due a decline in staffing activities  partially offset by a increase in the solutions oriented operating profits 
despite a decline in revenues  the fleet services operating profits increased by nearly due to an improved gross margin as a percent of sales and reduced overhead expenses 
every line of business  with the exception of telecom  recorded year on year improvements in gross margin percentages in fourth quarter results for the fourth quarter of  sales were million  compared with million in the period  reflecting a decrease 
the net loss for the quarter was million or per diluted share versus a loss of million or per diluted share last year 
the results include restructuring and other charges of million in the current year quarter compared with million in the period also includes a million increase in the reserve for bad debts 
the period included goodwill amortization  which is now excluded under current accounting regulations 
on a pro forma basis  the current quarter loss of million or per diluted share would compare with a net loss of million or per diluted share for the same period last year 
consistent with the full year discussion  the driving force of the reduction in operating profits was the company s telecom business unit  which represented the majority of the decline 
the company  however  did experience a slowdown in late december in its technical group  which it attributed to budget issues and plant shutdowns at two major customers 
in early  the work at those customers has returned to normal levels 
in the fourth quarter of  both the technical group and technology solutions operations recorded positive earnings compared with the prior year quarter exclusive of restructuring and other charges 
fleet services profits were essentially even with the prior year s quarter  despite an sales decline 
on a sequential quarter basis  the operating profits of the technical group  technology solutions and fleet services division all improved over the previous quarter of also after removing the restructuring and other charges taken in the period 
the former bluestorm business  which is now part of the telecom group  was profitable in the quarter

in addition  at december  and  chief executive has note payable to the company of million and million  respectively  which is included in the other current assets 
in  due to the lack of improvement in the financial condition of chief executive and the continuing decline in the publishing industry as a whole  the company increased its allowance for doubtful accounts by million to cover its estimated losses resulting from chief executive s inability to make required payments 
the company performs ongoing reviews of chief executive s profitability and market value as well as that of other publishing organizations 
the company believes that the need for additional allowance is reflective of the economic downturn in the publishing industry 
restructuring and other charges in april  the company announced a company wide cost reduction plan 
the company recorded restructuring and other charges totaling million during these charges were for costs incurred to eliminate excess capacity  reduce both staff and service delivery personnel in all of the company s business units  the closing of certain unprofitable locations and the termination of unprofitable contracts and activities

accounting changes change in accounting for goodwill and certain other intangibles effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets not be amortized  but be tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level 
an impairment charge will be recognized only when the implied fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  is less than its carrying amount 
accordingly  the company ceased amortization of all goodwill 
the company performed the transitional goodwill impairment test 
the company determined the implied fair value of each of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
this evaluation indicated that goodwill recorded in the technology solutions segment was impaired as of january  the primary factor resulting in the impairment charge was the continuing difficult economic environment in the information technology sector 
accordingly  the company recognized a non cash charge of approximately  net of tax benefit of approximately  recorded as of january   as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write down of goodwill to its fair value 
no impairment charge was appropriate under the previous goodwill impairment standard  which was based on undiscounted cash flows 
change in accounting for derivative instruments as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  subsequently amended by sfas no 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of those instruments will be reported in earnings or other comprehensive income depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the accounting for gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of the derivative and the effect on the consolidated financial statements will depend on its hedge designation and whether the hedge is highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in the fair value of cash flows of the asset or liability hedged 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
as amended  and in accordance with the transition provisions  the company recorded unrealized loss of approximately  net of tax benefit of approximately  to accumulated other comprehensive income

fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees
