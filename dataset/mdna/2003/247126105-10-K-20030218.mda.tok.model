item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations outlook and note to our consolidated financial statements 
industry the automotive parts industry provides components  systems  subsystems and modules to vms for the manufacture of new vehicles  as well as to the aftermarket for use as replacement parts for current production 
table of contents and older vehicles 
we believe that several key trends have been reshaping the automotive parts industry over the past several years increasing electronic and technological content 
the electronic and technological content of vehicles continues to expand  largely driven by consumer demand for greater vehicle performance  functionality and affordable convenience options as well as increasingly stringent regulatory standards for automotive fuel efficiency  emissions and safety 
electronics integration  which generally refers to products that combine integrated circuits  software algorithms  sensor technologies and mechanical components within the vehicle  allows vms to achieve substantial reductions in weight and mechanical complexity  resulting in easier assembly  enhanced fuel economy  improved emissions control and better vehicle performance 
the technology content of vehicles is also increasing as consumers demand greater safety  entertainment  productivity and convenience while driving 
the technology that offers mobile voice and data communication such as that used in our mobile electronics products coupled with global positioning sensors and in vehicle entertainment is making steady inroads into the transportation industry 
global capabilities of suppliers 
in order to serve multiple markets in a more cost effective manner  many vms are turning to global vehicle platforms such as world cars  which typically are designed in one location but produced and sold in many different geographic markets around the world 
broader global markets for vehicle sales and the desire of vms to adapt their products to satisfy regional and cultural variations have driven suppliers to establish capabilities within the major regions  as they follow their customers 
optimizing supply chain value stream 
in order to continue to respond to increasingly competitive market pricing dynamics  suppliers are establishing comprehensive plans to remove waste from the enterprise value stream 
this includes optimizing the flow of information between the vm  the tier supplier a supplier which sells directly to a vm  and other tiers of the supply chain 
value stream efficiencies are also increasingly being achieved through earlier collaboration between vms and suppliers in the advanced product design  engineering and manufacturing phases of the product delivery cycle 
additional benefits are also being realized due to greater collaboration between tier and lower tier suppliers on product design  material selection  manufacturing  processing  and product packaging 
many of these efficiencies are enabled by internet based supply chain management tools  computerized modeling and computerized product design software tools 
increased emphasis on systems and modules sourcing 
to simplify the vehicle design and assembly processes and reduce their costs  vms increasingly look to their suppliers to provide fully engineered systems and pre assembled combinations of components rather than individual components 
by offering sophisticated systems and modules rather than individual components  tier suppliers such as delphi have assumed many of the design  engineering  research and development and assembly functions traditionally performed by vms 
in addition  suppliers often manufacture and ship components to the general location of a vms assembly line and then provide local assembly of systems and modules 
ongoing industry consolidation 
the trend in consolidation among worldwide suppliers is expected to continue as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies and value stream efficiencies through business combinations  build stronger customer relationships by following their customers as they expand globally  acquire complementary technologies  and shift production among locations 
the need for suppliers to provide vms with single point sourcing of integrated systems and modules on a global basis has also fueled industry consolidation 
additionally  vms are experiencing rapid consolidation which impacts customer supplier relationships and provides opportunities and risks as suppliers attempt to secure global supply contracts across broader vehicle platforms 
shorter product development cycles 
suppliers are under pressure from vms to respond more quickly with new designs and product innovations to support rapidly changing consumer tastes and regulatory requirements 
for example  vehicle demand in north america has shifted from cars to light trucks and vans over the last several years  and  more recently  crossover and hybrid vehicles are being introduced into the market 
these trends will require suppliers to modify their operations to focus on parts for these vehicles 
in developing countries  broad economic improvements continue to be made  increasing the demand for smaller  
table of contents less expensive vehicles that satisfy basic transportation needs 
in addition  increasingly stringent government regulations regarding vehicle safety and environmental standards are accelerating new product development cycles

similarly  while our trademarks are important to identify delphi s position in the industry  and we have obtained certain licenses to use intellectual property owned by others  we do not believe that any of these are individually material to our business 
we are actively pursuing marketing opportunities to commercialize and license our technology to both automotive and non automotive industries 
this leveraging activity is expected to further enhance the value of our intellectual property portfolio 
products and competition although the overall number of our competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation  the automotive parts industry remains extremely competitive 
vms rigorously evaluate suppliers on the basis of product quality  price competitiveness  reliability and timeliness of delivery  product design capability  technical expertise and development capability  new product innovation  leanness of facilities  operational flexibility  customer service and overall management

customers we primarily sell our products and services to the major global vms 
while our business with customers other than gm has increased since our separation from gm in the separation  and we expect such business to continue to increase over time  we also expect that gm will remain our largest customer for a significant period of time due to the long term nature of sales contracts in our industry and our strong customer supplier relationship with gm 
our sales to gm have declined since the separation  principally reflecting the impact of customer trends  the exit of some businesses  as well as gm s diversification of its supply base and changes in our vehicle content and the product mix supplied to them 
due to the higher production levels in compared to  our gm sales in were stable compared to while we intend to continue to focus on retaining and winning gm s business  we cannot assure you that we will succeed in doing so 
additionally  our revenues may be affected by increases or decreases in gm s business or market share 
we continue to project our sales beyond to grow modestly assuming projected production levels  with non gm sales increasing and gm sales decreasing 
we currently supply parts to each regional sector of gm s automotive operations  including its automotive operations in the united states  canada and mexico gm north america  and gm s automotive operations throughout the rest of the world gm international 
in addition  we sell our products to the worldwide aftermarket for replacement parts  including gm s service and parts operations gm spo 
the following table shows from where our total net sales were derived for each of the last three years 
total net sales year ended december  customer dollars in millions gm north america gm international gm spo total gm other customers total net sales included in sales to other customers in the foregoing table are sales to each of the major global vms other than gm 
our sales to five of these other major global vms have exceeded or approached million in  including daimlerchrysler corporation  ford motor company  psa peugeot citroen  renault nissan motor company  ltd and toyota motor corporation 
also included in other customers are sales to manufacturers of medium duty and heavy duty trucks commercial vehicles and other new customers 
table of contents beyond our traditional automotive customer base new markets 
we are continuing our efforts to diversify our business by supplying certain products  including audio systems  batteries  fiber optic links  thermal systems  connection systems  flex circuits  wiring  instrumentation and pressure sensors  and engine controllers to these non vm customers 
these products are used in the commercial vehicle  aftermarket  recreational vehicle eg  boats  aerospace  telephone  motorcycle  defense  construction  and computer industries 
some of our commercial vehicle and new markets customers are case new holland  caterpillar  inc  deere and company  freightliner  volvo truck  cisco systems  harley davidson inc  ibm  lockheed martin corporation  ericsson  general electric  philips and brunswick 
we expect these sales to grow rapidly in future years as we commercialize existing technology and continue our focus on diversifying our customer base  although we can give you no assurances that this will occur 
in and  we realized sales of million and million  respectively  to our commercial vehicle and new markets customers 
variability in delphi s business a significant portion of our business is generally related to automotive sales  which vary directly with the production schedules of our vm customers 
the market for vehicles is highly cyclical and depends on general economic conditions  consumer spending and preferences 
the rate at which our customers build vehicles depends on their market performance as well as company specific inventory and incentive strategies 
any significant reduction in automotive production by our customers would have a material adverse effect on our business 
according to automotive news  a leading trade publication  automotive production in north america in was higher than the prior year 
production schedules for our largest customer in north america  our largest market  were approximately higher in than in in part reflecting the lower vehicle inventories coupled with the impact of heavy incentive activity by us vehicle manufacturers 
however  most of our other major automotive markets  with the exception of china  remained weak 
we have substantial operations in every major region of the world and economic conditions in these regions often differ  which may have varying effects on our business 
our business is moderately seasonal as our primary north american customers historically halt operations for approximately two weeks in july and approximately one week in december 
our european customers generally reduce production during the months of july and august and one week in december 
in addition  third quarter automotive production is traditionally lower as new models enter production 
accordingly  third and fourth quarter results may reflect this seasonality 
raw materials we purchase various raw materials for use in manufacturing our products 
the principal raw materials we purchase include platinum group metals  copper  aluminum  steel  lead and resins 
all of these raw materials  except the platinum group metals which we use primarily to produce our catalytic converters  are available from numerous sources 
currently  most of the platinum group metals we use for catalytic converters produced for gm are procured directly from gm 
delphi purchases its remaining platinum group metal requirements directly from delphi suppliers  which primarily obtain or produce platinum group metals from locations in south africa  north america and russia 
we have not experienced any significant shortages of other raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials in excess of those reasonably required to meet our production and shipping schedules 
with steel  the section provision a tariff instituted with the stated intention of providing the us steel industry temporary relief to allow the industry to adjust to import competition has influenced the domestic steel market for price and availability 
at delphi  steel is purchased under long term commitments and consequently  has not been impacted by significant price or supply issues 
moreover  delphi is taking steps to reduce our exposure to these factors 
however  there can be no assurance that a continuation of trade protective measures will not result in price or supply issues over the longer term 
environmental compliance we are subject to the requirements of us federal  state  local and non us environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
these include laws regulating air emissions  water 
table of contents discharge and waste management 
we have an environmental management structure designed to facilitate and support our compliance with these requirements globally 
although it is our intent to comply with all such requirements and regulations  we cannot assure that we are at all times in compliance 
we have made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements  although such expenditures were not material during and and we do not expect such expenditures to be material in environmental requirements are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
accordingly  we cannot assure that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future 
delphi is subject to complex laws governing the protection of the environment and requiring investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination 
we are in various stages of investigation and cleanup at our manufacturing sites where contamination has been discovered 
in addition  delphi has received notices that it is a potentially responsible party prp in proceedings at various sites  including the tremont city landfill site located in tremont  ohio 
the tremont city landfill site proceeding  which is alleged to concern ground water contamination  is in the early stages of investigation and involves multiple other prps 
based on information gathered to date  delphi has been identified as the largest waste generator prp  however we expect that other parties  including landfill operator and transporter prps  will ultimately have to share a significant portion of the overall site costs 
in september  delphi and other prps entered into a consent order with the epa to perform a remedial investigation and feasibility study concerning a portion of the site 
we have reserved approximately million for our share of the expected investigation costs 
the investigation is expected to be completed during  as various epa reviews are required through each phase of the study 
although we believe that these reserves are adequate  because the scope of the investigation is still being determined  we cannot ensure that our share of the investigative costs and ultimate cost  if any  to remediate the site will not exceed the amount of these reserves 
we may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  including with respect to divested and acquired businesses 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
as of december   our reserve for such environmental investigation and cleanup was approximately million  which reflects in part the retention by gm of the environmental liability for certain inactive sites as part of the separation 
we cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves 
arrangements between delphi and gm the separation of delphi from gm was effective january   when we assumed the assets and related liabilities of gm s automotive components businesses 
in connection with the separation  we entered into agreements allocating assets  liabilities and responsibilities in a number of areas including taxes  environmental matters  intellectual property  product liability claims  warranty  employee matters  and general litigation claims 
we also agreed to indemnify gm against substantially all losses  claims  damages  liabilities or actions arising  whether before or after the separation  out of or in connection with our business and or our conduct of our business going forward 
before the separation  we depended upon other business sectors of gm and some of gm s affiliates and suppliers for certain services 
although at levels substantially below the levels at the time of separation  gm continues to provide a number of services to us  including information technology services  under various transition services agreements 
supply agreement 
under our supply agreement with gm entered into in connection with the separation  we had a limited right of last refusal  subject to our ability to provide competitive pricing  on the first replacement cycle of product programs we were then supplying 
this right of last refusal expired on january  and  accordingly  we now bid for gm s business on the same basis as our competitors 
while we cannot provide any assurance as to our future business with gm  our win rate for defending existing gm business for which we were the incumbent was in excess of for this was similar to our win rate for defending business during accordingly  we do not believe that the expiration of 
table of contents the right of last refusal has materially adversely impacted our business with gm 
to compete effectively  we will need to continue to satisfy gm s pricing  service  technology and increasingly stringent quality and reliability requirements  which  because we are gm s largest supplier  particularly affect us 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business with gm is governed by applicable underlying supply contracts under terms similar to those in our supply contracts with other vm s 
in addition  although the right of last refusal expired on january   certain other provisions of the supply agreement remain in force and supplement the underlying supply contracts between delphi and gm that were in effect on january  existing agreements so long as such existing agreements  including any extension thereof  are in effect 
consistent with gm s contracts with other suppliers  on a case by case basis  gm may terminate a supply contract either in the case of existing agreements  pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement  or in the case of agreements entered into since the separation  the terms of the underlying supply contract itself with delphi and resource the business to another supplier for a variety of factors  such as our non competitiveness including  in many cases  price as well as quality  service  design  and technology  cause  expiration and  in some cases  termination for convenience 
however  except with respect to annual purchase orders  where gm is exercising its re sourcing rights due to non competitiveness for a particular product  gm is required to notify us of any such non competitiveness and provide us with a reasonable period of time during which to correct any such non competitiveness before gm may re source the business 
termination for convenience means gm can terminate the contract at any time for any reason 
the majority of underlying contracts having termination for convenience provisions are annual purchase orders or long term contracts  which usually allow gm to terminate for convenience only after months 
this right to terminate for convenience could be exercised by gm in connection with any change in control of delphi 
certain change in control transactions could also give gm the right to terminate the supply agreement or the underlying contracts 
termination of a majority of our underlying supply contracts with gm would be likely to have a material adverse effect on our company 
the supply agreement also applies to service parts we provide to gm for sale to gm authorized dealers worldwide under existing agreements 
in general  similar to supply contracts with other vm s  unless otherwise provided in our existing agreements with gm  the unit pricing on service parts that are not past model will continue at the prices charged to gm until three years after such service parts go past model 
the term past model refers to parts which are used on vehicle models which are no longer in production 
thereafter  unit prices for such service parts will be negotiated between the parties 
most underlying supply contracts entered into between delphi and gm after the separation contain similar provisions regarding pricing of past model service parts 
in addition  under the supply agreement  if we propose to close a plant  eliminate a product line or divest of a division  we must keep gm informed of our decision making process and in good faith reasonably consider gm s concerns 
upon our selection of a qualified buyer  existing contracts with gm relating to the business being sold may be assigned to the buyer upon gm s consent  which will not be unreasonably withheld 
aftermarket sales 
service parts provided to gm pursuant to the supply agreement for sale to gm authorized dealers and distributors are currently covered by our purchase agreements for the production parts 
aftermarket sales in the united states are covered by a memorandum of understanding mou between gm spo and delphi entered into in under the mou  delphi is entitled to directly sell and distribute our products to the aftermarket in the united states 
in addition  the mou provides that we will continue to supply volumes of aftermarket products to gm spo in the united states at a level based on prior year s sales  adjusted by mutual agreement for business and market conditions  pursuant to separate supply agreements each  an aftermarket supply agreement 
unless otherwise agreed  each aftermarket supply agreement will be for an initial term of three calendar years and will continue thereafter until either party gives twelve months prior written notice 
pricing under the aftermarket supply agreements is based on the pricing in effect during calendar year  subject to mutually agreeable market based adjustments from time to time 
under each aftermarket supply agreement  if we can meet the market price for a particular aftermarket product  gm spo must buy such aftermarket product from us 
alternatively  we 
table of contents may choose not to meet the market price for a particular aftermarket product  in which case gm spo may choose to re source and delphi will cease supplying such product to gm spo for the aftermarket in the united states or gm spo may choose to purchase the products from delphi at the higher price 
gm notified us in january that it is not renewing any of its aftermarket supply agreements at the end of as a result  beginning in  we will have to negotiate with gm spo standard gm purchase order terms for those products that gm wants to continue to source from delphi 
we do not believe the expiration of the aftermarket supply agreements will have a material adverse impact on our aftermarket sales 
employee matters 
as part of the separation we entered into several agreements with gm to allocate responsibility and liability for certain employee related matters 
in connection with gm s disposition of certain businesses including delphi  gm granted the united automobile workers uaw guarantees covering benefits to be provided to certain former us hourly employees who became our employees 
we have entered into an agreement with gm that requires us to indemnify gm if gm is called on under this guarantee 
as a means of mitigating the risk that the guarantee will be called upon  we have also agreed to consult with gm before taking certain fundamental corporate actions and obtain gm s consent not to be unreasonably withheld before entering into transactions which might significantly adversely affect our ability to meet our pension and postretirement benefits such as would cause our credit rating to be downgraded below b from moody s or b from standard poors 
we are currently rated baa by moody s and bbb by standard poors 
certain flow back rights 
national union negotiations also resulted in some of our hourly employees in the us being provided with certain opportunities to transfer to gm as appropriate job openings become available at gm and gm employees in the us having similar opportunities to transfer to our company to the extent job openings become available at our company 
if such a transfer occurs  in general  both our company and gm will be responsible for pension payments  which in total reflect such employee s entire years of service 
allocation of responsibility between delphi and gm will be on a pro rata basis depending on the length of service at each company although service at delphi includes service with gm prior to the separation 
the company to which the employee transfers  however  will be responsible for opeb obligations 
there will be no transfer of pension assets or liabilities between gm and us with respect to such employees that transfer between our companies 
an agreement with gm provides for a mechanism for determining a cash settlement amount for opeb obligations associated with employees that transfer between our company and gm 
all of the agreements that we entered into in connection with our separation from gm were made in the context of our parent subsidiary relationship 
the terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties

the delphi uswa national labor agreement expires in september to finalize uaw national negotiations and separation of the delphi uaw bargaining unit from the gm uaw unit  delphi agreed that the delphi uaw national labor agreement will mirror the gm uaw national labor agreement  except as otherwise agreed by delphi and the uaw 
we believe that  as in all pattern bargaining in our industry  flexibility will be achieved to address local or national issues  including labor costs and that the uaw will be willing to consider such modifications as are necessary to assure the continued success of delphi as an on going business 
item properties our world headquarters campus is located in troy  michigan 
we occupy this facility  as well as certain other facilities  under lease agreements 
regional headquarters are also maintained in tokyo  japan  paris  france  and s o paulo  brazil 
excluding our joint ventures and other investments  we currently maintain approximately sites in countries throughout the world  including manufacturing facilities and engineering facilities 
we also have customer centers and sales offices 
of the sites  are owned and are leased in the united states and canada  are owned and are leased in mexico  are owned and are leased in europe middle east africa  are owned and six are leased in south america and eight are owned and are leased in asia pacific 
our electronics mobile communication sector has separate manufacturing facilities  and three dedicated technical centers 
our safety  thermal electrical architecture sector has separate manufacturing facilities  two dedicated technical centers and dedicated customer centers and sales offices 
our dynamics propulsion sector has separate manufacturing facilities  nine dedicated technical centers and three separate customer centers and sales offices 
the remaining manufacturing facilities  technical centers  customer centers and sales offices are sites that support multiple sectors 
we are currently evaluating long term plans to consolidate our worldwide engineering and technical resources  including our technical centers  into a more efficient  customer focused global engineering support network 
while we believe that this consolidation will enhance our ability to provide engineering and technical support to our customers around the world  we also expect that it will have the effect of reducing the overall number of our technical centers 
we believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate  and have sufficient productive capacity  to meet our current anticipated needs 

table of contents item legal proceedings we are involved in routine litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
we do not believe that any of the litigation to which we are currently a party will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
in november  a federal district court jury awarded a former supplier to delphi approximately million inclusive of accrued interest  in connection with a commercial dispute 
delphi and the supplier filed post trial motions seeking a directed verdict  and delphi also sought a new trial 
in february  the district court denied all parties motions 
both parties appealed the district court s judgment and have filed briefs with the ninth circuit court of appeals 
on december   the parties argued their respective positions before the ninth court of appeals and are awaiting the court s decision 
while legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainty  we believe we had valid grounds for appeal  and it is possible that the existing judgment could be substantially altered or eliminated by the appellate court 
consequently  in the opinion of management and counsel  it is not possible to estimate the outcome of such uncertainty at this time 
we record provisions for any legal judgments  at the time that management and counsel conclude a loss is probable 
although we do not believe any current litigation will have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition  we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the failure of our products results or is alleged to result in personal injury or death  and we cannot assure you that we will not experience any material product liability losses in the future 
in addition  if any delphi designed products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products 
each vm has its own policy regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers 
as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  vms are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with product liability claims 
because this is a recent trend in our industry and we have only limited experience in this regard  we cannot assure you that our future costs associated with providing product warranties will not be material 
in connection with the separation  gm agreed to retain responsibility for all product liability actions relating to products we manufactured prior to january  and sold or otherwise supplied to gm either before or after that date 
we are responsible for all product liability actions relating to products we sold at any time to customers other than gm 
responsibility for product liability actions relating to products manufactured on or after january  and sold to gm are determined in accordance with the agreements for such sales 
delphi may also be subject to significant financial and legal obligations with respect to certain divested businesses 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  delphi receives notices from customers that products may not function properly 
the terms and conditions of the applicable contract generally govern our warranty responsibility for our products  which vary from contract to contract 
most of our contracts require that we make certain warranties to our customers regarding  among other things  conformity to specifications and freedom from defect 
vms generally offer warranties to new vehicle purchasers  which cover the repair and replacement of defective parts on their vehicles for a specified period of time 
traditionally  vms have borne the cost associated with such warranty programs  including costs related to the repair and replacement of parts supplied to the vehicle manufacturer by the supplier 
vms are increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products 
depending on the terms under which delphi supplies products to a vm  a vm might seek to hold delphi responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of such products under new vehicle warranties  when the product supplied did not perform as represented 
notwithstanding that we believe our quality has improved  a few vms have advised delphi that they intend to pursue warranty claims vigorously 
in particular  although in we settled or resolved most of our known pre separation warranty claims with gm  gm recently requested that delphi agree to reimburse gm for the anticipated costs of gm s voluntary recall campaign to repair certain to models which gm states could experience a failure of the power steering gear lower pinion bearing 
in addition  gm may assert additional pre separation claims in the future 
as we have already informed gm  we believe that this 
table of contents claim and the remainder of known pre separation warranty claims are adequately covered by commercial defenses or customer credits and that we have no further financial liability for such matters 
accordingly  although we cannot ensure that the future costs of warranty claims by gm or other customers will not be material  we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements 
our warranty reserves are based upon our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims 
we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of these reserves  and make adjustments when appropriate 
however  the final amounts determined to be due related to warranty matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 
we believe that we are adequately insured  including with respect to product liability coverage  at levels sufficient to cover any of the other claims described above  subject to commercially reasonable deductible amounts 
we have also established reserves in amounts we believe are reasonably adequate to cover any adverse judgments 
however  any adverse judgment in excess of our insurance coverage and such reserves could have a material adverse effect on our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the economic climate throughout remained challenging as the benefits of higher production volumes in north america were in part offset by continued weakness in other major automotive markets  with the exception of china 
despite this tough environment we exceeded our objectives for in december  our outlook for was sales of billion and net income  excluding any restructuring or product line charges  of million 
our actual net sales were billion  with billion or of sales to non gm customers  up from our gm sales in were billion and were stable with last year 
net income for  excluding net restructuring and product line charges of million million after tax was million 
these results exceeded our outlook for for the full year  we benefited from the steady growth of the company s non gm business and have continued to diversify our customer base through sales of high tech products 
our previously announced restructuring plans are being completed ahead of schedule  on track with original estimated costs  and are yielding substantial savings 
our restructuring plan is over complete and will be completed in the first quarter of savings realized from our restructuring plans combined with other operating performance improvements have allowed us to address the challenges of rising wages and pension and healthcare costs  as well as continued price pressures 
we remain focused on operating cost reductions resulting from restructuring and cost containment initiatives 
global restructuring plans and impairment charges as a result of uncertain industry conditions and the decision to more rapidly implement delphi s long term portfolio plans  delphi announced global restructuring plans in the first quarter of designed to reduce structural costs  improve the earnings power of our portfolio of businesses and streamline our structure 
in the first quarter of  delphi approved further restructuring plans to eliminate  positions from our global workforce  downsize more than selected facilities in the united states and europe  and exit certain other activities by the end of the first quarter of through december    employees have left through these plans 
in connection with the first quarter of restructuring plans  we recognized restructuring charges of million related to plans to sell  close  or consolidate nine plants  downsize the workforce at more than other facilities and exit selected products 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we recorded asset impairment charges of million related to long lived assets at the sites impacted by the restructuring plans and impairment charges of million related to permanent declines in the value of certain joint ventures 
total charges incurred in connection with the restructuring plans and impairment charges were million million after tax 
upon completion of our plans  in the first quarter of  we reversed million of the original million charge on the restructuring line in our consolidated statements of income 
the million was a result of a minor shortfall in planned head count reductions as well as slight favorable variances in the costs actually incurred under the various initiatives 
this reversal was netted against the restructuring charge 
the restructuring charge incurred as a result of the restructuring totaled million with million of employee costs including post employment benefits and special termination pension benefits and million in other exit costs lease cancellation costs and contract cancellation fees 
this charge  when netted against the million reversal noted above for the restructuring reserve  resulted in a net restructuring charge of million million after tax in the first quarter of the million asset impairment charges recorded in the first quarter of  primarily related to machinery and equipment held for use in the safety  thermal and electrical architecture sector were recorded in depreciation and amortization 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million  included in depreciation and amortization  related primarily to the machinery and equipment held for use in the electronics mobile communications sector 
this equipment

in addition  in  we recorded charges of million  included in other income expense related to declines in the value of certain joint ventures  principally in korea  caused by the uncertain recoverability of assets of the underlying ventures 
this uncertainty resulted from the corporate reorganization proceedings of a korean customer business partner 
this uncertainty was substantially resolved on september   with the approval of the reorganization plan by the korean bankruptcy court  which provided for only partial recovery of receivables for applicable creditors  which included delphi and several of its korean joint ventures 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded an additional charge of million  related to the resolution of the reorganization

net sales to gm increased by million  as a result of increased volumes in north america  partially offset by the mix of products sold  lower prices and exited businesses 
our non gm sales primarily increased by billion  or  in part driven by double digit growth in several high technology product lines with bmw  daimlerchrysler  ford  hyundai and renault nissan 
these products include passive occupant detection  mobile multimedia  diesel engine management systems and connection systems 
as a percent of our net sales for our non gm sales grew to 
our net sales also were impacted by continued price pressures that resulted in price reductions of approximately million  or for compared to approximately million or for fourth quarter net price reductions were million and million in and  respectively  reflecting and of respective net sales 
fourth quarter price reductions were lower than fourth quarter  primarily due to the timing of price actions 
on a going forward basis  we expect future annual price reductions to be in the range 
net sales for mobile multimedia products decreased from million in to million in  primarily due to the planned resourcing of a telematics system for certain vehicles  partially offset by increased sales of other entertainment and navigation systems 
gross margin 
our gross margin was for compared to for the improvement reflects increased volume and material cost reductions  partially offset by million of price reductions 
manufacturing cost savings were also realized as a result of our restructuring plans and continued efficiency improvements  partially offset by higher wages and increased us pension and healthcare expenses 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a charge of million related to our generator product line  this charge is explained below

in the first quarter of  delphi approved restructuring plans to eliminate  positions from our global workforce  downsize more than selected facilities in the united states and europe  and exit certain other activities by the end of the first quarter of the first quarter restructuring charge totaled million with million of employee costs including postemployment benefits and special termination pension benefits and million in other exit costs lease cancellation costs and contract cancellation fees 
this charge  when netted against the million reversal noted below for the restructuring reserve  resulted in a net restructuring charge of million million after tax in the first quarter of the plans entail the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide  comprised of  us employees and  employees in us locations 
employees at impacted locations were informed of the restructuring initiatives and the benefits available to them under applicable benefit plans or related contractual provisions 
affected employees have left or will leave delphi using a mixture of voluntary or involuntary separation programs  early retirements  social plan programs  and layoffs 
we expect to pay approximately million in cash related to the restructuring programs with the remaining million for non cash special termination pension benefits 
in  we paid million related to employee costs and million related to exit costs  and expect to pay the remainder in the first quarter of as of december   approximately  us employees and  non us employees have been separated under the plans 
we expect the remaining employees to separate during the first quarter of we began to realize savings related to the restructuring actions during the second half of with estimated ongoing savings expected to grow in early to more than million after tax 
these savings are expected to be realized as reductions to cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses 
absent a turnaround in global capital market conditions or abatement in healthcare cost increases  we currently expect that these savings will be partially offset by increased employee and retiree pension and healthcare costs as well as continued price pressures 
the first quarter restructuring plans resulted in a charge of million that included million of employee costs including postemployment benefits and special termination pension and postretirement benefits and million in other exit costs principally lease termination and contract cancellation payments 
the plans entailed the elimination of approximately  positions worldwide  comprised of  us hourly employees   us salaried employees  and  employees in us locations 
we ultimately eliminated  positions and incurred costs of million 
for the us hourly workforce  we reduced  positions against a plan of  positions 
this shortfall occurred during the first quarter of  due to minor variances in the execution of our restructuring plans 
we eliminated  non us positions  slightly above the planned  positions  and we eliminated  us salaried employee positions as planned 
total cash paid for the first quarter restructuring plan was million  with million for employee costs and million for other exit costs 
we also had million of non cash charges  principally for special termination pension and postretirement benefits 
upon completion of our plans  in the first quarter of  we reversed million of the original million charge on the restructuring line in our consolidated statements of income 
the million is a result of the minor shortfall in head count noted previously  as well as slight favorable variances in the costs actually incurred under the various initiatives 
this reversal was netted against the restructuring charge explained above 
approximately  positions have been eliminated under the and programs through december

in total  the first quarter charges for restructuring and our generator product line decreased earnings by a net million million after tax  and used million of cash flow during as of december   we planned to dispose of our generator product line 
the total loss recorded in related to the planned disposal of this product line was million million after tax 
in the first quarter of  we recorded an additional loss of million million after tax  reflecting additional anticipated employee related payments  due to changes in the proposed disposition at that time 
the total recorded loss of million million after tax included a charge to depreciation and amortization of million million after tax to write down fixed assets to net realizable value  a total charge to cost of sales of million to write down inventory in the business to net realizable value  a charge to cost of sales of million for contractually required payments principally employee related  and million to write down other assets 
in july  we determined that we would not complete the transaction and began a process to wind down this product line 
as a result  we reviewed our current estimates with respect to wind down related costs  including redundant work force costs and determined  based upon our current expectations  that our reserves for these items were adequate 
these amounts are based upon our best estimates with respect to timing of the wind down process and ultimate resolution of contractually required payments 
due to the significance of the estimates involved  the final costs for the wind down of the product line could materially differ from the recorded amounts 
due to the change from our original plan to sell this product line  in the second quarter of  we reclassified the generator product line as held for use from held for sale 
no additional adjustments were required as the result of the reclassification 
the wind down process affects a number of parties  including our customers  employees and suppliers 
discussions with these affected parties have progressed materially and are expected to continue throughout we have notified our customers of the wind down and are supporting the customers in the selection of replacement suppliers 
our generator business had annual sales of approximately billion  and we expect to see a meaningful decline in generator sales over the next twelve months 
advanced and development engineering for the generator product line has been discontinued for all but committed programs 
capital expenditures supporting the generator product line for were curtailed and were generally expensed when incurred 
capital expenditures previously planned for have been substantially eliminated

liquidity and capital resources the following are some key metrics that we use when we internally monitor our liquidity and capital resources 
our net liquidity  which is calculated as cash and cash equivalents less total debt  was  million at december  as compared to  million at december  the improvement is due principally to our decision to enter into transactions to sell million of our accounts receivable at december  excluding these transactions  our net liquidity  on a comparable basis to would have been  million

the company continues to evaluate alternative pension funding scenarios for shareholder value enhancement while also being suitable from a bondholder perspective 
delphi has two financing arrangements with a syndicate of lenders providing for an aggregate of billion in available revolving credit facilities the credit facilities  subject to certain limitations 
the terms of the credit facilities provide for a five year revolving credit line in the amount of billion  which expires june  and a day revolving credit line in the amount of billion  which expires june as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facilities 
our credit facilities also contain certain affirmative and negative covenants including  among others  requirements for a debt coverage ratio 
in addition  certain of our lease facilities discussed below contain cross default provisions to our credit facilities 
we were in compliance with all such covenants as of december  utilizing the credit facilities as back up  delphi maintains billion of worldwide commercial paper programs  under which billion was outstanding as of december  we also have approximately million available under uncommitted lines of credit 
as of december   there was no amount outstanding under these uncommitted lines of credit 
other amounts outstanding primarily relate to borrowings by certain of our international subsidiaries 
at december   our total debt was billion 
delphi is rated by standard poor s  moody s and fitch ratings 
we currently have long term credit ratings of bbb baa bbb  respectively  and short term credit ratings of a p f  respectively  which were 
table of contents reviewed by the rating agencies in december although not currently anticipated  if we were downgraded to bbb baa bbb  we believe we would continue to have access to sufficient liquidity  however  our cost of borrowing may increase 
in addition  as a result of our short term credit ratings  our access to the commercial paper market has recently been limited 
as further described below  we were able to refinance commercial paper using a number of programs 
to the extent that current levels of commercial paper become unavailable  these alternative financing programs as well as other means of financing  would be utilized 
our short term credit rating by standard poor s was lowered to a in the fourth quarter of the short term rating reflects standard poor s concerns surrounding reduced financial flexibility resulting from our pension liabilities as well as our continued exposure to capital market conditions and the risk of us labor contract negotiations 
we believe that our pension obligations are manageable  see outlook us pension plans below for further discussion 
however  as a result of this short term credit rating  our access to the commercial paper market has been limited during the fourth quarter we are working to improve our credit rating and re access the commercial paper market 
however  in the interim we have entered into several other programs to provide us with our short term cash needs 
these programs are described below 
we expect to establish a us accounts receivable securitization program during the first part of this program would permit us to borrow against our us accounts receivable 
in addition  to the extent it is cost effective and efficient we are considering entering into other types of short term borrowing programs  including additional factoring or other securitization programs 
in order to provide financial flexibility to delphi and our suppliers  we maintain a program through general electric capital corporation gecc pursuant to a trade payables agreement 
when the delphi supplier elects to participate in the program  gecc pays the supplier the amount due from delphi  prior to the due date of the accounts payable 
in exchange for the early payment  our suppliers accept a discounted payment 
on the original due date of the payables  we pay gecc the full amount 
these amounts are classified as accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet of delphi  at december   we had approximately million due to gecc under this program 
starting in the fourth quarter of  we exercised our right to enter into another agreement with gecc  whereby we are permitted to defer payment on these accounts payable discussed above to gecc for a period of up to days  and in exchange we pay gecc a fee for the period of such deferral 
as of december   we have elected to defer payment on approximately million of such payables  these amounts have been classified as short term debt 
also in the fourth quarter of  we entered into a program where gecc paid certain suppliers  on our behalf  the regularly scheduled payment according to the terms of our purchase orders with those suppliers 
we elect  for a fee  to pay gecc at a date generally days later than the regularly scheduled payment terms 
at december  we have elected to delay approximately million that has been paid by gecc for us  and is also classified as short term debt 
in addition  one of our customers has arranged with gecc to provide a trade payables program to its suppliers 
during the fourth quarter of  we elected to participate in this program as well 
the program permits us to sell certain of our customer receivables  at a discount  to gecc on a non recourse basis 
when we participate in this program  our receivables are reduced and our cash balances are increased 
at december   our receivables were reduced by million as a result of this program 
finally  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into new accounts receivable sale programs in europe 
at december   we had sold approximately million of receivables under these programs 
from time to time  certain subsidiaries may also sell receivables in the normal course of their operations 
such sales are generally consistent year to year and do not significantly impact our liquidity 

table of contents the following table summarizes our cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments payments due by period total thereafter in millions debt and capital lease obligations operating lease obligations contractual commitments for capital expenditures other contractual purchase commitments  including information technology total we have guaranteed the borrowings of one venture for approximately million 
we do not expect the guarantee to have any effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we have no other financial commitments such as lines of credit  standby lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations nor have we guaranteed such items to or on behalf of entities that are excluded from our consolidated financial statements 
from time to time we enter into purchase commitments with our suppliers under customary purchase order terms 
any significant losses implicit in these contracts would be recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   no such losses existed 
delphi leases certain property  primarily land and buildings  under leases commonly known as synthetic operating leases 
these leases  which are accounted for as operating leases  provide us tax treatment equivalent to ownership  and also give us the option to purchase these properties upon lease expiration 
the leases generally expire within the next three to five years and can be extended based upon the terms of the agreements 
in aggregate  our purchase price  if we chose to exercise such options  approximates million 
these leases also require us to guarantee a minimum value of million upon expiration of the leases 
the lease agreements also contain provisions requiring us to indemnify the lessors for environmental liabilities associated with the property under certain circumstances 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount 
however  we do not expect such amounts  if any  to be material 
in addition  certain of these lease facilities contain cross default provisions to our credit facilities 
at december   the aggregate fair value of these properties under such leases exceeds the minimum value guaranteed 
delphi s cash flows during the year are impacted by the volume and timing of vehicle production  which includes a halt in most operations of our north american customers for approximately two weeks in july and one week in december and reduced production in europe during the months of july  august and one week in december 
we believe that delphi has sufficient financial flexibility to fund these fluctuations  although there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in addition  we believe that our capital resources and liquidity position are sufficient to satisfy our funding needs during our three year business planning cycle 
requirements for working capital  pension contributions  acquisitions  capital expenditures  dividends  repayment of debt securities  payments for purchase options and residual guarantees on operating leases  and restructuring obligations are expected to be funded from operations  supplemented as needed by short term or long term borrowings  our credit facilities  operating leases and other available financing sources as necessary 
for additional information on delphi s credit facilities and other funding sources  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled billion for the year ended december  compared to billion in and billion in net cash provided by operating activities in was particularly impacted by our decision to sell certain receivables rather than 
table of contents issue commercial paper to finance our short term cash requirements 
an increase in accounts payable  primarily due to purchases supporting higher production levels  also positively impacted our cash flows 
conversely  our working capital was negatively impacted by an increase in inventory  principally to support higher production levels 
net cash provided by operating activities in was also impacted by a million voluntary contribution to our us hourly pension plan and a million payment to gm for previously recorded separation related obligations for other postretirement benefits 
the payment to gm represented the final payment required to settle our separation related obligations 
net cash provided by operating activities in resulted from improved working capital management partially offset by a million payment to gm for previously recorded separation related obligations 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of cash in reflects capital expenditures related to ongoing operations 
the use of cash during reflects the acquisitions of delphi mechatronic systems and delphi connections systems specialty electronics for an aggregate of approximately billion and capital expenditures related to ongoing operations 
our capital expenditure program promotes our growth oriented business strategy by investing in existing core areas  where efficiencies and profitability can be enhanced  and by targeting funds for new innovative technologies  where long term growth opportunities can be realized 
capital expenditures by product sector and geographic region for the periods presented were year ended december  in millions electronics mobile communication safety  thermal electrical architecture dynamics propulsion other total capital expenditures north america europe  middle east africa asia pacific south america total capital expenditures as of december   delphi had approximately million in outstanding capital commitments 
we expect capital expenditures to be approximately billion in we currently expect approximately of our capital expenditures to occur outside the united states 
we also expect to utilize operating cash flow and possibly some of our debt capacity to undertake shareholder value enhancing activities 
such activities could include strategic acquisitions that will build upon existing core competencies and expand our market coverage in both traditional automotive and non automotive markets and a share repurchase program 
financing activities 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was billion  million and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in financing activities during reflected repayments of commercial paper  dividend payments and treasury stock purchases 
cash provided by financing activities for includes the net proceeds from a million public debt offering offset by repayments under our commercial paper program 
dividends 
the delphi board of directors declared dividends on delphi common stock of per share on march  june  september  and december   which were paid on april  august  october  and january   respectively 
stock repurchase program

we repurchased approximately million shares in the open market during and  to offset the effect of shares issued under those plans and to provide for a more consistent number of shares outstanding  of the million shares authorized  million shares remain available for repurchase 
outlook realignment 
in october  we announced a realignment of our business sectors  which was effective on january  the realignment and the resultant assignment of new responsibilities to certain of delphi s senior leadership was done to strengthen the company s focus on customer relationships and growth  accelerate lean transformation across key business processes and place more emphasis on initiatives to resolve under performing assets in our portfolios 
beginning january   the company has three reporting segments that are grouped on the basis of similar product  market and operating factors dynamics  propulsion thermal sector  which includes selected businesses from our energy and engine management systems  chassis  steering and thermal systems product lines 
electrical  electronics  safety interior sector  which includes selected businesses from our automotive electronics  audio  consumer and aftermarket products  communication systems  safety and power and signal distribution systems product lines 
automotive holdings group is comprised of product lines and plant sites that do not meet our targets for net income or other financial metrics 
this will further enable consistent and targeted management focus on finding solutions to these businesses 
the realignment is designed to increase focus on products and services having the greatest long term benefit for delphi while at the same time placing an equal focus on businesses requiring additional management attention 
it is a further step in the implementation of our long term portfolio plans 
as part of the realignment  alan s 
dawes was promoted to vice chairman and chief financial officer  retaining his prior responsibilities  while assuming oversight for the automotive holdings group 
dawes oversight will provide synergy between finance  the mergers and acquisitions activity and the team responsible for seeking the best alternative for challenged businesses 
donald l 
runkle was promoted to vice chairman and chief technology officer 
he is the senior executive responsible for product leadership  streamlining processes  and integrating the critical efforts of purchasing  engineering and manufacturing to raise corporate performance to the next level of a lean enterprise 
in addition  rodney o neal was named president of the newly formed dynamics  propulsion thermal sector  david b 
wohleen was named president of the newly formed electrical  electronics  safety interior sector  jose maria alapont was given a newly created position as president  international operations and vice president of sales and marketing  and james a 
bertrand  president of safety interior systems  received the additional title of president of the automotive holdings group reporting to alan s

general 
based on preliminary first quarter schedules it appears our north american production schedules will remain firm  however  we are cautious that this stability could be impacted by weakening vehicle retail sales and will be somewhat offset by continued softness in other major automotive markets 
our non gm revenue grew by during  and represents of our sales  up from in the same period last year 
driven by an outlook for strong non gm sales growth  and assisted by restructuring and other cost reduction activities  we expect our sales to be approximately billion  slightly higher than our sales of billion 
non gm revenue is expected to be billion  accounting for of total revenue for we expect net income will be approximately million 
delphi continues to implement productivity improvements and streamline activities designed to reduce overhead and improve manufacturing processes 
in addition  we continue to streamline our portfolio  reduce excess capacity and operating costs  and respond to global industry conditions and increased employee related costs such as us health care and pensions as well as wages in non us locations 
as previously announced  we are in the process of winding down our generators product line 
we expect to see a meaningful decline in generator sales over the next twelve months 
advanced and development engineering for the generator product line has been discontinued for all but committed programs 
capital expenditures supporting the 
table of contents generator product line for were curtailed  and capital expenditures previously planned for have been eliminated 
in  as a result of tax structuring and planning activities  substantial earnings from the asia pacific region will be considered indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations  having the effect of decreasing residual us taxes on those foreign earnings 
this change is expected to reduce delphi s effective tax rate to in in addition to conditions in our market and the economy as a whole  we depend on gm as a customer 
gm accounted for of our net sales for our sales to gm have declined since the separation  principally reflecting the impact of customer driven price reductions and the elimination of non profitable businesses as well as gm s diversification of its supply base and recent changes in our vehicle content and the product mix supplied to them 
we also continue to exit some businesses as part of our portfolio review process 
reflecting these and other factors  we expect our sales to gm to decline over time 
if we are unable to compete effectively for new business with gm s other suppliers  our revenues may decline further 
while we intend to continue to focus on retaining and winning gm s business  we cannot assure you that we will succeed in doing so 
additionally  our revenues may be affected by increases or decreases in gm s business or market share 
our gm north america content per vehicle for was  and we anticipate our content per vehicle will be  we continue to project our sales beyond to grow modestly assuming projected production levels  with non gm sales increasing and gm sales slightly decreasing 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and warranty claims in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and such failure of our products results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience any material warranty or product liability losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims 
in addition  if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in a recall involving such products 
each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers 
however  as suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims 
a recall claim brought against us  or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties 
depending on the terms under which we supply products to a vehicle manufacturer  a vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties  when the product supplied did not perform as represented 
accordingly  although we cannot assure you that the future costs of warranty claims by our customers will not be material  we believe our established reserves are adequate to cover potential warranty settlements 
our warranty reserves are based upon our best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims 
we regularly evaluate the appropriateness of these reserves  and adjust them when appropriate 
however  the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded estimates 
in the normal course of business  we extend credit on open account to our customers 
from time to time  we also invest in joint ventures with a variety of business partners 
although delphi is affected by the financial well being of the automotive industry as a whole  we believe that our risk associated with trade receivables and recoverability of investments in our joint ventures is mitigated by our customer base and ongoing control procedures to monitor the credit worthiness of customers and viability of joint venture business partners 
as part of our ongoing procedures  we regularly review our joint venture investments for potential impairments or permanent declines in value 
us pension plans 
delphi sponsors defined benefit pension plans covering certain hourly and salaried employees in the us on december   the projected benefit obligation exceeded the market value of plans assets by billion  compared to billion at december  the increase in the underfunded status of our plans is primarily due to a basis point decline in the discount rate used to value the liabilities 
table of contents and the impact of the unfavorable asset return environment  partially offset by a billion pension contribution made during while the interest rate and asset return environment significantly impacted the funded status of our plans  delphi does not expect to have minimum funding requirements  as set forth in employee benefit and tax laws  before delphi contributed billion to the pension plan in january and we expect to contribute an additional billion later this year for a total of billion in considering our contributions to date in and assuming all other factors are consistent with our year end valuation  the underfunded status of our plans would be reduced to billion 
while contributions subsequent to are dependent on asset returns and a number of other factors  if we make contributions of billion in we would be required by employee benefit and tax laws to make contributions of approximately billion in and approximately billion in delphi is currently evaluating alternative funding strategies to pull ahead the funding of our pension obligations through various financial instruments whose maturity will match the timeframe of our employees demographics 
delphi s objective is to have an individual s pension fully funded at retirement 
the discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations was based on a review of long term bonds  including published indices  which receive one of the two highest ratings given by recognized rating agencies 
the discount rate determined on that basis decreased from for to for this basis point decline in the discount rate had the effect of increasing the underfunded status of our us pension plans by approximately billion 
for  delphi assumed a long term asset rate of return of 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our third party pension plan asset managers  including their review of asset class return expectations and long term inflation assumptions 
we also considered delphi s post spin off and gm s pre spin off historical year compounded return period ended december   which was in line with our long term rate of return assumption 
in light of continued poor investment performance in the global equity markets during  declining bond yields and slightly revised long term inflation assumptions  delphi reassessed the expected long term pension asset return assumption and reduced it from to  effective january  this change did not impact pension expense  but it will adversely impact pension expense beginning in see below for further information 
the long term asset return assumption for is based on an asset allocation assumption of with us and international equity managers  with fixed income managers  and with other asset managers primarily real estate 
delphi s asset managers regularly review the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
at december  our actual asset allocation was generally consistent with our asset allocation assumption 
delphi s us pension expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we base our determination of the asset return component of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
as of december  we had cumulative asset losses of approximately billion  which remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market related value of assets 
the declining interest rate environment and asset losses versus asset return expectations in  and resulted in an accumulated actuarial loss of billion at december  of this amount billion is not considered when determining pension expense 
the loss not considered relates to the deferred market value of asset adjustments  which is excluded until that loss is recognized in our market related value of assets  and the loss that falls within our corridor of the pension benefit obligation or fair market value of assets  whichever is higher which is excluded in accordance with sfas no 
employer s accounting for pensions 
the remaining actuarial loss of billion at december  is 
table of contents amortized over the remaining service life of our pension plan participants 
this amortization will increase pension expense by approximately million 
for  we expect pension expense to exceed pension expense by about billion 
about million of the increase relates to the basis point reduction in the long term asset return assumption  about million relates to the basis point decline in the discount rate during and the balance of about million primarily relates to the impact of the asset loss incurred on pension assets in these increases include the impact of the amortization of actuarial losses mentioned above 
inflation inflation generally affects delphi by increasing the cost of labor  equipment and raw materials 
we believe that  because rates of inflation in countries where we have significant operations have been moderate during the periods presented  inflation has not had a significant impact on our results of operations 
deferred income taxes as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  at december   delphi s consolidated balance sheet included a net deferred tax asset of approximately billion 
this net deferred tax asset relates to temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
approximately billion of the net deferred tax asset balance is related to our obligations for postretirement and pension benefits and approximately billion  net of valuation allowance  is related to net operating loss carryforwards 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent upon profitable operations in the united states and certain other countries and future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  we believe that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized through the reduction of future taxable income 
management has considered various factors in assessing the probability of realizing these deferred tax assets including delphi s operating results  excluding the impact of special items  over the most recent three year period and overall financial forecasts of book and taxable income for the period 
the ability to utilize tax planning  such as capitalization of research and experimentation costs for tax purposes  to manage the degree to which delphi generates significant us federal tax net operating losses 
the extended period of time over which the tax assets can be utilized 
postretirement benefits become tax deductions over periods up to years 
environmental matters delphi is subject to various laws governing the protection of the environment including laws regulating air emissions  water discharges and waste management 
delphi has made and will continue to make capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements 
however  such expenditures were not material during the years ended december   and and are not expected to be material in or environmental requirements are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that these requirements will not change or become more stringent in the future in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are in various stages of investigation and cleanup at our manufacturing sites where contamination has been discovered 
in addition  delphi has received notices that it is a potentially responsible party prp in proceedings at various sites  including the tremont city landfill site located in tremont  ohio 
the tremont city landfill site proceeding  which is alleged to concern ground water contamination  is in the early stages of investigation and involves multiple other prps 
based on information gathered to date  delphi has been identified as the largest waste generator prp  however we expect that other parties  including landfill operator and transporter prps  will ultimately have to share a significant portion of the overall site costs 
in september  delphi and other prps entered into a consent order with the epa to perform a remedial 
table of contents investigation and feasibility study concerning a portion of the site 
we have reserved approximately million for our share of the expected investigation costs 
although we believe that these reserves are adequate  because the scope of the investigation is still being determined  we cannot assure you that our share of the investigative costs and ultimate cost  if any  to remediate the site will not exceed the amount of these reserves 
delphi may be named as a prp at other sites in the future  including with respect to divested and acquired businesses 
when it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites  provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   our reserve for such environmental investigation and cleanup was approximately million  which reflects  in part  the retention by gm of the environmental liabilities for certain inactive sites  as part of the separation 
the policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impact of environmental matters are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the process of estimating environmental cleanup liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site  the complexity of the site  the uncertainty as to what remedy and technology will be required  the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and  at multi party sites  other prps 
in future periods  new laws or regulations  advances in cleanup technologies and additional information about the ultimate cleanup remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserve 
recently issued accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued several accounting pronouncements that will become effective for us in the future 
these include sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fasb interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees of indebtedness of others the adoption of these accounting pronouncements will not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position  however certain additional disclosures may be required 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the interpretation addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities  more commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
the interpretation immediately applies to entities created after january   and after july  for existing variable interest entities 
as discussed above  we have entered into certain synthetic operating leases for certain operating assets that would require consolidation under this interpretation 
we expect to terminate those agreements prior to july   if we do not do so  we may be required to include an additional million in assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 

table of contents we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the table below presents information about the nature and rationale for delphi s critical accounting estimates balance sheet caption critical estimate item nature of estimates required assumptions approaches used accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities warranty obligations estimating warranty requires us to forecast the resolution of existing claims and expected future claims on products sold 
vms are increasingly seeking to hold suppliers responsible for product warranties  which may impact our exposure to these costs 
we base our estimate on historical trends of units sold  and payment amounts combined with our current understanding of the status of existing claims and discussions with our customers 
pension and other post retirement benefits pension and other post retirement benefits in calculating our obligation and expense  we are required to select certain actuarial assumptions  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these assumptions include discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
our assumptions are determined based on current market conditions  historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries 

table of contents balance sheet caption critical estimate item nature of estimates required assumptions approaches used property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other long term assets valuation of long lived assets and investments we are required from time to time to review the recoverability of certain of our assets based on projections of anticipated future cash flows  including future profitability assessments of various product lines 
we estimate cash flows using internal budgets based on recent sales data  independent automotive production volume estimates and customer commitments 
deferred income taxes recoverability of deferred tax assets in particular  net operating loss carryforwards we are required to estimate whether recoverability of our deferred tax assets is more likely than not based on forecasts of taxable earnings in the related tax jurisdiction 
we use historical and projected future operating results  based upon approved business plans  including a review of the eligible carryforward period  tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not as critical as those discussed above 
these include the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and reserves for excess and obsolete inventory 
although not significant in recent years  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a significant effect on our financial statements 
forward looking statements all statements contained or incorporated in this report  to the extent they are not limited to historical fact  which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate may occur in the future including statements relating to future sales or earnings expectations  savings expected as a result of our global restructurings or other initiatives  portfolio restructuring plans  volume growth  share of sales  awarded sales contracts and earnings per share expectations or statements expressing general optimism about future operating results are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and are intended to be subject to the safe harbor protection provided by this act 
these statements are made on the basis of management s current views and assumptions with respect to future events  as a result  there can be no assurance that management s expectations will necessarily come to pass 
delphi does not intend or assume any obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
principal important factors  risks and uncertainties  which may cause actual results to differ from those expressed in such forward looking statements  include  but are not limited to our ability to execute our portfolio and other global restructuring plans in a manner which satisfactorily addresses any resultant antitrust  labor issues  customer concerns  and other matters  any contingent liabilities related to divestitures or integration costs associated with acquisitions  and to achieve the benefits relating to reduced structural costs and improved earnings power that we expect from these plans

our ability to maintain financial flexibility to make payments for pensions and other postretirement employee benefits and to implement capital expenditures  all at the levels and times planned by management 
our ability to increase sales to customers other than gm 
our continued dependence on gm as our largest customer and our ability to retain gm business  by continuing to satisfy gm s pricing  service  technology and increasingly stringent quality and reliability requirements  which  because we are gm s largest supplier  particularly affect us

other factors  risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates and certain commodity prices 
in order to manage these risks  we operate a centralized hedging program that consists of entering into a variety of derivative contracts with the intent of mitigating our risk to fluctuations in exchange rates and commodity prices 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report and further disclosure is provided in note to those consolidated financial statements 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor exchange and commodity risks  and related hedge positions 
positions are monitored using a variety of analytical techniques including market value and sensitivity analysis 
the following analyses are based on sensitivity tests which assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates and commodity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  appropriate models are utilized to determine the impact of shifts in rates and prices 
currency exchange rate risk we have currency exposures related to buying  selling and financing in currencies other than the local currency in which we operate 
these exposures may impact future earnings and or operating cash flows 
in some instances  we choose to reduce our exposures through financial instruments hedges that provide offsets or limits to our exposures 
currently  our most significant currency exposures relate to the mexican peso  euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  singapore dollar  polish zloty  british pound and brazilian real 
as of december  and  the net fair value asset liability of all financial instruments with exposure to currency risk was approximately million and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million at december  and million at december  the impact of a adverse change in rates on fair value differs from a change in the net fair value asset liability due to the existence of hedges 
the model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates  however  exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
commodity price risk commodity swaps and option contracts are executed to offset our exposure to the potential change in prices mainly for various non ferrous metals used in the manufacturing of automotive components 
the net fair value of our contracts was a liability of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
if the price of the commodities that are being protected by our commodity swaps and options contracts changed adversely by  the december  fair value liability of our commodity swaps and options contracts would increase by million to million  and the december  fair value liability would increase million to million 
the changes in the net fair value liability differ from of those balances due to the relative differences between the underlying commodity prices and the prices in place in our commodity swaps and options contracts 
these amounts exclude the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 

table of contents interest rate risk a portion of our borrowings from third party credit sources is comprised of billion in fixed rate term debt maturing in   and we also issue commercial paper and factor accounts receivable in the u 
s 
and in europe 
our outstanding commercial paper balance was billion at december  and decreased  in the fourth quarter of  to billion at december  our daily average outstanding balance for was million 
the maturities on commercial paper have been short term with the majority maturing within one month 
when commercial paper matures  it may be re issued at the then current market rate 
in addition  factoring programs fees are based upon an interest rate component 
however  given our reliance on fixed rate borrowings to fund long term requirements  we believe our interest rate risk exposure is limited and accordingly  we have not entered into any derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk
