item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this item contains forward looking statements  which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of commitments and contingencies we have no commitments or contingencies which would require further disclosure in our financial statements other than letters of credit totaling million at december   maintained for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which would become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts 
no amounts have been drawn under the letters of credit 
net income for the year ended december  includes a charge of million related to the financial failure in of a workers compensation insurance carrier that had provided coverage for the company in prior years 
trading and investing we have not engaged in trading activities that include high risk securities  such as derivatives and non exchange traded contracts 
we invest cash primarily in highly liquid  short term investments such as overnight deposits  money markets  and highly rated municipal and commercial bonds 
however in june and october  we acquired a total of  shares of common stock of tmbr sharp drilling  inc  a company whose stock is traded on the nasdaq national market system  for a total of million 
description of business we are a leading provider of land based contract drilling services to major and independent oil and natural gas operators in texas  new mexico  oklahoma  louisiana  mississippi  utah  and western canada 
as of december   we owned drilling rigs 
we provide drilling fluids  completion fluids  and related services to oil and natural gas operators in west texas  southeast new mexico  south texas  east texas  oklahoma  the gulf coast regions of texas and louisiana  and the gulf of mexico 
drilling and completion fluids are used by oil and natural gas operators during the drilling process to control pressure when drilling oil and natural gas wells 
we provide pressure pumping services to oil and natural gas operators in the appalachian basin 
these services consist primarily of well stimulation and cementing for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells 
we are also engaged in the development  exploration  acquisition  and production of oil and natural gas 
our oil and natural gas operations are focused in producing regions in west texas  southeast new mexico  and south texas 
the contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services from through most of and from mid through the second quarter of however  except for those periods and other occasional upturns  generally  there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and geographic segments of the north american land drilling industry 
as a result  drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins 
in addition to adverse effects that future declines in demand could have on patterson uti  ongoing factors which could adversely affect utilization rates and pricing  even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices and increased drilling activity  include movement of drilling rigs from region to region  reactivation of land based drilling rigs  or new construction of drilling rigs 
we cannot predict either the future level of demand for our contract drilling services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas contract drilling business 
critical accounting policies in addition to established accounting policies  our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment  oil and natural gas properties  impairment  revenue recognition  and the use of estimates 
property and equipment property and equipment  including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset  are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred 
we provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
no provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment 
we review our assets  including intangible assets  for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets either exceed their respective fair values or may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives 
provisions for asset impairment are charged to income when estimated future cash flows  on an undiscounted basis  are less than the asset s net book value 
impairment charges are recorded based on discounted cash flows 
there were no impairment charges during the years  or oil and natural gas properties we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  using the field as the accumulation center  for our oil and natural gas properties 
exploration and development costs which result directly in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
exploration costs which do not result directly in the discovery of oil and natural gas reserves are charged to expense 
capitalized costs  consisting of lease and well equipment  lease acquisition costs  and intangible development costs  are depreciated  depleted  and amortized on the units of production method  based on petroleum engineer estimates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves of each respective field 
impairment of proved oil and natural gas properties is periodically assessed based on estimated future net cash flows at a field level as determined by an independent reserve engineer 
impairment expense is included in depreciation  depletion  and amortization in the accompanying financial statements 
revenue recognition generally  revenues are recognized when services are performed 
the company follows the percentage of completion method of accounting for footage contract drilling arrangements 
under this method  drilling revenues and costs related to a well in progress are recognized proportionately over the time it takes to drill the well 
due to the nature of turnkey contract drilling arrangements and risks therein  the company follows the completed contract method of accounting for such arrangements 
under this method  all drilling advances and costs including maintenance and repairs related to a well in progress are deferred and recognized as revenues and expenses in the period the well is completed 
provisions for losses on incomplete or in process wells are made when estimated total costs are expected to exceed estimated total revenues 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
key estimates used by management include allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation  depletion  and amortization  asset impairment  reserves for self insured levels of insurance coverages  and fair values of assets and liabilities assumed

related party transactions in and  we leased a beech king air airplane owned by ssi oil and gas  inc  an entity beneficially owned by cloyce a 
talbott  patterson uti s chief executive officer  and directly owned by a 
glenn patterson  patterson uti s president chief operating officer 
under the terms of the lease  we paid a monthly rental of  the costs of fuel  insurance  taxes  and maintenance of the aircraft 
such amounts totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
the company operates certain oil and natural gas properties in which certain of our affiliated persons have participated  either individually or through entities they control  in the prospects or properties in which we have an interest 
these participations  which have been on a working interest basis  have been in prospects or properties originated or acquired by patterson uti 
at december   affiliated persons were working interest owners in of the wells then being operated by patterson uti 
sales of working interests are made by patterson uti to reduce its economic risk in the properties 
generally  it is more efficient for patterson uti to sell the working interests to these affiliated persons than to market them to unrelated third parties 
sales were made by patterson uti at its cost  comprised of patterson uti s costs of acquiring and preparing the working interests for sale 
these costs were paid by the working interest owners on a pro rata basis based upon their working interest ownership percentage 
the price at which working interests were sold to affiliated persons was the same price at which working interests were sold to unaffiliated persons 
the following table sets forth production revenues received and joint interest billings paid by each of the affiliated persons during for all wells operated by patterson uti in which they have working interests 
these numbers do not necessarily represent their profits or losses from these interests because the joint interest billings do not include the parties related drilling and leasehold acquisition costs incurred prior to january  year ended december  production joint revenues interest name received billings cloyce a

in and  we paid approximately  and  respectively  to tmp truck and trailer lp tmp  an entity owned by thomas m 
patterson son of a 
glenn patterson  for certain equipment and metal fabrication services 
purchases from tmp were at then current market prices 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of approximately million including cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
for  our significant sources of cash flow were million derived from operations  million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  and million from the sale of certain property and equipment 
correspondingly  we used approximately million to acquire  common shares of tmbr sharp drilling  inc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included as part of item to this report  and approximately million to make capital expenditures for the betterment and refurbishment of our drilling rigs  for the acquisition and procurement of drilling equipment  to fund capital expenditures for our drilling and completion fluids and pressure pumping divisions  and to fund leasehold acquisition and development and exploration of oil and natural gas properties 
on march   we acquired five scr electric land based drilling rigs from odin drilling  inc  increasing our land based drilling fleet to the purchase price of million consisted of  shares of our common stock valued at per share 
a deferred tax liability of million was recorded as a result of the transaction 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and the related purchase price was allocated among the rigs based on their estimated fair values 
subsequent to december   the company purchased seven drilling rigs  in two separate transactions  for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the acquisitions were funded out of the company s existing cash 
we believe that the current level of cash and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  should be sufficient to meet our capital needs 
from time to time  acquisition opportunities are reviewed relating to our business 
the timing  size or success of any acquisition and the associated capital commitments are unpredictable 
over the longer term  should further opportunities for growth requiring capital arise  we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital  cash generated from operations  and either debt or equity financing 
however  there can be no assurance that such capital would be available 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and the following tables summarize operations by business segment for the twelve months ended december  and year ended december  contract drilling change dollars in s revenues   direct operating costs   selling  general  and administrative   depreciation and amortization   operating income   operating days   average revenue per operating day average direct operating cost per operating day average margin per operating day number of owned rigs at end of period average number of rigs owned during period average rigs operating rig utilization percentage capital expenditures   the following table illustrates the average market price of natural gas and our average rigs operating for each of the fiscal quarters in and st nd rd th quarter quarter quarter quarter average natural gas price average rigs operating average natural gas price average rigs operating our rig count began to decline in the third quarter of and continued until march when our rig count bottomed at rigs rigs in the us and rigs in canada 
the deterioration in our rig count was primarily the result of weakening natural gas prices through mid february natural gas prices then rebounded somewhat and our rig count improved marginally during the period from march through september in the fourth quarter of  consistent with improved natural gas prices  our rig count continued to improve and averaged rigs rigs in the us and rigs in canada 
the decreased operating results in were reflective of a significant decline in demand for our contract drilling services as evidenced by decreases in the number of operating days and average rig utilization 
increased competition during for available jobs resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased operating revenues 
increased operating costs were primarily attributable to increased labor costs  including payroll expenses and workers compensation insurance costs 
payroll expenses increased as experienced field personnel were retained despite the significant decline in our average rig utilization 
management believes this strategy is beneficial as it retains experienced personnel and facilitates the company s response to increased demand levels as industry conditions improve 
general and administrative expenses decreased primarily as a result of reduced incentive compensation in depreciation and amortization increased in primarily as a result of significant capital expenditures in and to maintain  modify  and refurbish our drilling fleet and our acquisition of drilling rigs and related equipment from cleere drilling company in december year ended december  drilling and completion fluids change dollars in s revenues   direct operating costs   selling  general  and administrative   depreciation and amortization   operating income loss  total jobs   average revenue per job average costs per job average margin per job capital expenditures   the decrease in revenues for our drilling and completion fluids operations were primarily attributable to industry conditions  as discussed in contract drilling above  and the resulting decline in the number of jobs completed 
operating expenses per job increased despite reduced activity levels due to a portion of the segment s operating expenses being fixed in nature 
the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expense is primarily the result of reduced employee incentive compensation in year ended december  pressure pumping change dollars in s revenues   direct operating costs   selling  general  and administrative   depreciation   operating income   total jobs   average revenue per job average costs per job average margin per job capital expenditures   the decreases in revenues and expenses for our pressure pumping operations were primarily attributable to industry conditions  as discussed in contract drilling above 
expansion of our pressure pumping services in and into the appalachian regions of kentucky and west virginia resulted in increased depreciation and selling  general  and administrative expenses in the increase in average revenue per job was attributable to the change in the composition of operating revenues 
cementing revenue as a percent of total operating revenue increased from in to in and fracturing revenue as a percent of total operating revenue decreased from in to in cementing jobs  as compared to fracturing jobs  typically generate greater revenues as the services being provided are much more extensive  requiring us to incur increased operating and material costs 
additionally  operating costs per job increased in since a portion of direct operating costs remain constant despite fluctuating activity levels

direct operating costs declined in primarily due to the divestiture of marginally productive wells in  thus reducing lease operating costs 
depreciation and depletion declined in primarily due to significant decreased depletion expense in as a result of increased commodity prices at december  year ended december  corporate and other change dollars in s selling  general  and administrative   bad debt expense  depreciation and amortization other income merger costs  restructuring and other charges   capital expenditures   the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expense of primarily relates to reduced employee incentive compensation in restructuring and other charges reflect a million charge taken in the second quarter of due to the financial failure of a workers compensation insurance carrier we used from until march merger costs  restructuring  and other charges in include costs related to the merger with uti

however  beginning in the third quarter of the industry conditions began to deteriorate as the commodity prices of oil and natural gas significantly weakened 
market prices for oil fell from approximately per barrel at the end of to approximately per barrel in late and natural gas prices declined from approximately per mcf to under per mcf for the same time period 
accordingly  the demand for our contract drilling services was negatively impacted

direct operating costs increased in primarily due to the increased levels of production of natural gas 
depreciation and depletion increased in due to increased depletion expense in as a result of significantly decreased commodity prices at december  and impairment expense in of million compared to no impairment expense in this impairment in was attributable to declining commodity prices and unfavorable results from certain oil and natural gas prospects 
year ended december  corporate and other change dollars in s selling  general  and administrative   bad debt expense  depreciation and amortization other income merger costs  restructuring and other charges  capital expenditures  the merger costs and restructuring charges incurred in are associated with our merger with uti that occurred in selling  general  and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the increased activity as evidenced by the operating segments individual results of operations and the growth of our company in through acquisitions 
included in this increase are management and operational bonuses resulting from improved operations 
income taxes year ended december  dollars in s income before income tax    income tax expense    effective tax rate patterson uti s remaining unutilized investment tax credit carryforward expired in net operating losses were fully utilized in and our remaining alternative minimum tax credit of  may be carried forward indefinitely 
other deferred tax assets consist primarily of various allowance accounts and tax deferred expenses expected to generate a future tax benefit of approximately million 
our effective income tax rate for includes applicable to our statutory federal and state income tax rates and approximately attributable to permanent differences 
the significance of the impact of the permanent differences to our effective income tax rate in was largely attributable to our reduced pretax earnings 
we record non cash deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the relationship between the amount of our unused federal nol carryforwards and the temporary differences between the book basis and tax basis in our assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled 
as a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes  we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized 
we incurred deferred income tax expense of approximately million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenue  profitability  and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas  with respect to all of our operating segments 
historically  oil and natural gas prices and markets have been volatile 
prices are affected by market supply and demand factors as well as actions of state and local agencies  the united states and foreign governments  and international cartels 
all of these are beyond our control 
any significant or extended decline in oil and or natural gas prices would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the contract drilling business experienced increased demand for drilling services from through most of and from mid and continued through the second quarter of however  except for those periods and other occasional upturns  generally  there have been substantially more drilling rigs available than necessary to meet demand in most operational and geographic segments of the north american land drilling industry 
as a result  drilling contractors have had difficulty sustaining profit margins 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation will not have a significant near term impact on our financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently have no exposure to interest rate market risk as we have no outstanding balance under our credit facility 
should we incur a balance in the future  we would have exposure associated with the floating rate of the interest charged on that balance 
the revolving credit facility calls for periodic interest payments at a floating rate ranging from libor plus to 
the applicable rate above libor at december  is based upon our trailing twelve month ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
our exposure to interest rate risk due to changes in libor is not expected to be material 
we conduct some business in canadian dollars through our canadian land based drilling operations 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline
