item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial information as of and for each of the years ended december   and is consolidated to include the accounts of farmer mac and its wholly owned subsidiary  farmer mac mortgage securities corporation 
the following discussion should be read together with farmer mac s consolidated financial statements and is not necessarily indicative of future results 
forward looking statements certain statements made in this form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of pertaining to management s current expectations as to farmer mac s future financial results  business prospects and business developments 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may predict  forecast  indicate or imply future results  performance or achievements  and typically are accompanied by  and identified with  such terms as anticipates  believes  expects  intends  should and similar phrases

management s expectations for farmer mac s future necessarily involve a number of assumptions and estimates and the evaluation of risks and uncertainties 
various factors could cause farmer mac s actual results or events to differ materially from the expectations as expressed or implied by the forward looking statements  including uncertainties regarding o the rate and direction of development of the secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans  o the possible establishment of additional statutory or regulatory restrictions on farmer mac  o substantial changes in interest rates  agricultural land values  commodity prices  export demand for us agricultural products and the general economy  o protracted adverse weather  market or other conditions affecting particular geographic regions or particular commodities related to agricultural mortgage loans backing farmer mac i guaranteed securities  o legislative or regulatory developments or interpretations of farmer mac s statutory charter that could adversely affect farmer mac or the ability of certain lenders to participate in its programs or the terms of any such participation  o farmer mac s access to the debt markets at favorable rates and terms  o the possible effect of the risk based capital requirement  which could  under certain circumstances  be in excess of the statutory minimum capital level  o the outcome of the pending analysis of farmer mac by the general accounting office  o the growth rate of agricultural mortgage indebtedness  o the size of the agricultural mortgage market  o borrower preferences for fixed rate agricultural mortgage indebtedness  o lender interest in farmer mac credit products and the farmer mac secondary market  o the willingness of investors to invest in agricultural mortgage backed securities  o competitive pressures in the purchase of agricultural mortgage loans and the sale of agricultural mortgage backed and debt securities  o the effects on the agricultural economy of the government payments that are provided for in the farm bill signed into law may   or o changes in farmer mac s status as a government sponsored enterprise 
the foregoing factors are not exhaustive 
other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely impact farmer mac s business and its financial performance 
furthermore  new risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor assess the effects of such factors on farmer mac s business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
in light of these potential risks and uncertainties  no undue reliance should be placed on any forward looking statements expressed in this report 
furthermore  farmer mac undertakes no obligation to release publicly the results of revisions to any forward looking statements that may be made to reflect any future events or circumstances  except as otherwise mandated by the sec 
critical accounting policy and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes for the periods presented  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
the critical accounting policy that is both important to the portrayal of farmer mac s financial condition and results of operations and requires complex  subjective judgments is the accounting policy for allowance for losses  referred to in farmer mac s prior reports as reserve for losses 
the allowance for losses is presented in three components on the consolidated balance sheet o an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  o a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned net of valuation allowance  and o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
the purpose of the allowance for losses is to provide for estimated losses that are probable to have occurred as of the balance sheet date  and not to predict or account for future potential losses 
the determination of the allowance for losses requires management to make significant estimates based on information available as of the balance sheet date  including the amounts and timing of losses and current market and economic conditions 
these estimates are subject to change in future reporting periods if such conditions and information change 
for example  a continued decline in the national or agricultural economies could result in an increase in delinquencies or foreclosures  which may require additional allowances for losses in future periods 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on its loans held for investment  real estate owned and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
in estimating probable losses  management considers factors such as economic conditions  geographic and agricultural commodity concentrations  the credit profile of the portfolio  delinquency trends and historical charge off and recovery activity and evaluates the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model 
the allowance is increased through periodic provisions for loan losses that are charged against net interest income and provisions for losses that are charged to operating expense and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
to date  farmer mac has experienced no losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future 
further information regarding the allowance for losses is included in risk management credit risk loans 
results of operations overview 
was another year of solid growth and strong financial performance for farmer mac 
net income available to common stockholders rose to million in from million in  marking the sixth consecutive year during which farmer mac achieved significant increases in profitability 
diluted earnings per share were for  a percent increase over diluted earnings per share of 
the principal factors contributing to the year s record earnings were increases in net interest income on retained cash window loan purchases and non program investments and guarantee and commitment fees on the higher cumulative amount of guarantees and ltspcs outstanding 
net interest income increased million to million in  from million in  as interest earning assets increased by million to billion in  from billion in guarantee and commitment fee income grew percent to million in from million in  as outstanding guarantees and ltspcs increased billion  or percent  to billion 
the year s increase in guarantee and commitment fee income is indicative of the annuity like nature of that income 
the increase in outstanding guarantee and ltspc volume and asset growth was achieved while maintaining a relatively consistent ratio of operating expenses to total revenues  and despite the adverse effects of increased legal and consulting fees attributable to the effects of certain inaccurate and misleading publicity about farmer mac 
during  operating expenses were percent of total revenues  compared to percent in the effects of gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets increased the ratio of operating expenses to total revenues for to percent from percent 
the effect of gains and losses on financial derivatives and trading assets on the ratio of operating expenses to revenues was less than one percent for in  farmer mac s statutory charter was amended to allow farmer mac to act as a first loss guarantor 
as of december   the percentage of farmer mac i loans purchased or placed under farmer mac i guaranteed securities or ltspcs after changes to farmer mac s statutory charter in that were days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy or classified as real estate owned  decreased to percent  compared to percent at the end of as farmer mac s portfolio of loans held and loans underlying ltspcs and post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities has had certain cohort years of loan originations enter  and now start exiting  their peak default years  certain segments of the portfolio are beginning to exhibit characteristics of a mature portfolio 
for example  during and  the portfolio had its first loans cycle through foreclosure and into the asset category real estate owned  which completes the involuntary loan liquidation process 
as of december   farmer mac had million of real estate owned compared to million as of december  during the foreclosure process  the corporation devises a liquidation strategy that results in either an immediate sale of the property or retention pending later sale 
farmer mac evaluates these and other alternatives based upon economics and local law 
the portfolio also has developed a core of loans that  though the borrowers on those loans have filed for bankruptcy protection  are current under the original terms of the loans 
these trends are indicative of a maturing portfolio and management believes that presenting non performing assets as it has in the past is a more meaningful measure of business trends when presented in conjunction with a measure of day delinquencies 
non performing assets are loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy  or real estate owned 
day delinquencies are loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  or in bankruptcy  excluding loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan 
the difference between the non performing asset and day delinquencies measures is the exclusion of real estate owned and loans performing in bankruptcy from day delinquencies 
as of december  in thousands day delinquencies including loans in   foreclosure and loans restructured after delinquency loans performing in bankruptcy   real estate owned   non performing assets   the table below presents non performing assets and day delinquency data as of the dates indicated outstanding post act less loans  non reo and guarantees and performing performing day ltspcs assets percentage bankruptcies delinquencies percentage dollars in thousands as of december      september      june      march      december      september      june      march      farmer mac experienced million in net losses charged against the allowance for losses in  compared with million in net losses for through direct charges to earnings  farmer mac provided for million in total losses during compared to million during comparing to  this increase in farmer mac s provision for losses is comparable to the increase in the losses charged against the allowance 
farmer mac s total allowance for losses as of december  was million  compared to million as of december  in  the dollar level of day delinquencies could increase slightly and higher charge offs could follow 
these trends correlate to the entry of a growing percentage of farmer mac s portfolio into its peak loss years  price pressures on certain commodities not supported by government payments eg  permanent plantings  drought in the mountain region of the united states and the aftermath of a weak agricultural economy in outlook 
usda is currently forecasting net cash income on farms for to be billion  up percent from forecasted levels of billion 
the forecasted net cash income on farms for includes government payments of billion as compared to the billion in and increases in total crop and livestock receipts 
farm real estate values are expected to rise by approximately percent in  slowing slightly from their growth of percent in  percent in  and percent in on average  farm real estate values grew nearly percent annually during the s 
regionally  farm real estate values may vary with differing rates of increase  or even decrease  depending on differences in land quality and location  commodities grown  credit conditions  non farm investment opportunities  government farm policies  and production risks and weather uncertainties unique to each region s agriculture 
as management evaluates farmer mac s business prospects for and beyond  certain factors and conditions remain that are likely to constrain farmer mac s progress 
as a matter of historical practice  and particularly in the current interest rate environment  many institutions still prefer to retain agricultural mortgage loans in portfolio rather than sell them into the secondary market  notwithstanding the corporate finance and capital planning benefits they might realize through participation in farmer mac s programs 
some lending institutions subsidize their agricultural mortgage loan rates out of higher rates on non mortgage loans  or by low return use of equity  both of which generate uneconomic competition with farmer mac s loan rates 
while significant progress has been made in developing the secondary market for agricultural mortgages  farmer mac continues to face the challenges of establishing a new market where none previously existed 
acceptance of farmer mac s programs is increasing among lenders  reflecting the competitive rates  terms and products offered and the advantages farmer mac believes its programs provide 
as of december   farmer mac s outstanding program volume was billion  which represented approximately percent of management s estimate of a billion market of eligible agricultural mortgage loans 
for farmer mac to succeed in realizing its business development and profitability goals over the longer term  the use of farmer mac s programs and products by agricultural mortgage lenders  whether traditional or non traditional  must continue to expand 
a detailed presentation of farmer mac s financial results for the years ended december   and follows 
net interest income 
net interest income totaled million in  compared to million in  and the net interest yield was basis points in compared to basis points in the effects on farmer mac s net interest yield due to the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas for and were increases of seven basis points and one basis point  respectively  due to farmer mac s adoption of sfas on april  under sfas  loans purchased and securitized after april   for which farmer mac retained all the beneficial interest in the securitized loans  are classified as loans and the interest income recognized on those loans includes amounts that would have been classified as guarantee fees prior to april  prior to april   such securitizations were classified as farmer mac guaranteed securities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities sfas 
the effects of yield maintenance on farmer mac s net interest yield for and were increases of eight basis points and three basis points  respectively 
the increase in net interest income was due to a percent increase in the average balance of interest earnings assets  driven by a percent increase in average on balance sheet program assets that resulted from the retention of loans purchased during also  yield maintenance payment receipts were million during compared to million during for further information  see business volume and balance sheet review assets 
during  the average balance of non program assets  which consists of cash and cash equivalents and investments  increased percent 
net interest income totaled million in and million in the million increase from to was due to a percent increase in the average balance of interest earning assets  driven by a percent increase in average on balance sheet program assets 
net interest yield for was basis points 
the following table provides information regarding interest earning assets and funding for the years ended december   and the balance of non accruing loans is included in the average balance of interest earning loans presented  though no related income is included in the income figures presented 
therefore  as the balance of non accruing loans increases or decreases  the net interest yield will increase or decrease  accordingly 
net interest income and the yield will also fluctuate due to the uncertainty of the timing and size of yield maintenance payments

the average rates for cash and cash equivalents and discount notes reflect that decline in short term interest rates during  while the average rates for investments and loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities reflect the decline in interest rates for investments of similar term to the rate reset or maturity date

statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas requires the change in the fair values of certain financial derivatives to be reflected in a company s net income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
sfas became effective as of january  the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles recognized during was a charge of million  net of taxes 
during and  the net losses on financial derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas and trading assets recorded in farmer mac s consolidated statements of operations were million and million  respectively 
on a net after tax basis  those losses  combined with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principles and benefits received from the elimination of the amortization of certain premium payments that resulted from sfas  the effects of sfas reduced net income available to common stockholders by million and million for and  respectively 
other income 
other income  which is comprised of guarantee and commitment fee income and miscellaneous income  totaled million for compared to million for and million for guarantee and commitment fee income  which compensate farmer mac for assuming the credit risk on loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  was million for  compared to million for and million for the relative increase in guarantee and commitment fee income reflects an increase in the average balance of outstanding guarantees and ltspcs 
for  the effect of sfas reclassified million of guarantee fee income as interest income  although management considers that amount to have been earned in consideration for the assumption of credit risk 
that portion of the difference or spread between the cost of farmer mac s debt funding for loans and the yield on post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities held on its books compensates for credit and interest rate risk 
if a post act farmer mac i guaranteed security is sold to a third party  farmer mac continues to receive the guarantee fee component of that spread  which continues to compensate farmer mac for its assumption of credit risk 
the portion of the spread that compensates for interest rate risk would not typically continue to be received by farmer mac  except to the extent attributable to any retained interest only strip  if the asset were sold 
miscellaneous income was million for  compared to million for and million for the increase in miscellaneous income was primarily a result of the receipt of late fee income and processing fees on farmer mac ii refinance transactions

operating expenses 
during  operating expenses totaled million  compared to million for and million for operating expenses equaled percent of total revenues in  compared to percent in and percent in the dollar increase in operating expenses in primarily reflects higher legal  consulting and regulatory fees that resulted from certain inaccurate and misleading publicity farmer mac received during while the effects of that publicity have dissipated somewhat  ongoing events associated with that publicity could cause farmer mac to incur higher than expected legal and consulting fees in during third quarter  farmer mac incurred unexpected regulatory costs of approximately million above fca s assessment for the year ended september  fca has advised farmer mac that its regulatory assessment for the year ended september  will be an estimated million  an increase from the estimated million for the year ended september  farmer mac s provision for losses on loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is classified as a component of operating expenses  was million for  million for and million in the increases in the provisions were due to increases in outstanding farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs for which farmer mac assumes percent of the credit risk 
as of december   farmer mac s allowance for losses for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs was million  compared to million as of december  farmer mac also provides for losses on the loans on its balance sheet through provisions that are charged against net interest income on the statement of operations and presented as a reduction to the reported loan balances on farmer mac s balance sheet

extraordinary gain 
during first quarter  farmer mac recognized a net after tax extraordinary gain of million resulting from the repurchase of million of outstanding farmer mac debt 
during second quarter  farmer mac recognized a net after tax extraordinary gain of million resulting from the repurchase of million of outstanding farmer mac debt 
during fourth quarter  farmer mac recognized a net after tax extraordinary loss of million resulting from the repurchase of million of outstanding farmer mac debt 
all of these repurchases were from outstanding farmer mac debt that had a maturity date of october  and an interest rate of percent 
these debt securities were replaced with new fixed rate funding to the same maturity dates at more attractive interest rates  which preserves farmer mac s asset liability match and reduces future interest expense 
the combined net after tax extraordinary gain resulting from the repurchase of outstanding farmer mac debt in was million 
business volume and purchase prices 
during  the volume of loans purchased or placed under farmer mac guaranteed securities under ltspcs totaled billion  a percent increase over volume 
this increase largely resulted from the purchase of a million loan portfolio in second quarter and increases in ltspcs from billion in to billion in see business farmer mac programs farmer mac i off balance sheet guarantees and commitments and note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of ltspcs

the purchase price for loans purchased from all related parties is determined in the same manner as for loans acquired from any other third party 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of related party transactions 
as part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations for farmer mac i guaranteed securities and commitments to purchase eligible loans underlying ltspcs  farmer mac purchases defaulted loans  all of which are at least days delinquent at the time of purchase  out of those securities and pools 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased out of farmer mac i guaranteed securities is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the purchase price for defaulted loans purchased under an ltspc is the current outstanding principal balance of the loan  with accrued and unpaid interest on the defaulted loans payable out of any future loan payments or liquidation proceeds as received 
the purchase price of a defaulted loan is not an indicator of the expected loss on that loan  many other factors affect expected loss  if any  on loans so purchased

the increases in defaulted loans purchased and in defaulted loans transferred to loans reflect o the general increase in day delinquencies  o farmer mac s practice of purchasing day delinquent loans out of farmer mac i guaranteed securities  and o recordation in the consolidated financial statements of other loans over which it has regained effective control during the period 
with respect to the last circumstance cited  when particular criteria are met  such as the default of the borrower  farmer mac becomes entitled to exercise its option to purchase the defaulted loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities these options are commonly referred to as removal of account provisions 
farmer mac records these loans in the consolidated financial statements during the period in which farmer mac has the option to repurchase the loans and therefore regains effective control over the transferred loans 
the weighted average age of the farmer mac i newly originated and current seasoned loans purchased during and was years and months  respectively 
of the combined total of farmer mac i newly originated and seasoned loans that were purchased excluding purchases of defaulted loans during and  percent and percent  respectively  had principal amortization periods longer than the maturity date  resulting in balloon payments at maturity  with a weighted average remaining term to maturity of years and years  respectively

the outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs increased percent to billion as of december  from billion as of december  the following table sets forth information regarding those outstanding balances as of the dates indicated outstanding balance of farmer mac loans and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs as of december  in thousands farmer mac i post act loans and guaranteed securities    ltspcs    pre act    farmer mac ii    total    the following table sets forth information regarding the farmer mac guaranteed securities issued during the periods indicated farmer mac guaranteed securities issuances for the year ended december  in thousands retained   sold    swap transactions  total farmer mac guaranteed securities issuances    based on market conditions  farmer mac either retains farmer mac guaranteed securities or sells them to capital markets investors 
during and  farmer mac sold farmer mac i guaranteed securities to third parties totaling million and million  respectively  at no gain or loss 
ltspcs typically involve seasoned loans  while cash purchase transactions usually represent acquisitions of newly originated loans 
the increased activity in ltspcs is a result of growing recognition of the capital planning and corporate finance advantages that the structure offers by institutions that could so benefit 
management expects that ltspcs will continue to constitute a significant portion of farmer mac s new farmer mac i program activity during outstanding commitments to purchase loans other than under ltspcs and the total balance of loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet purchased are indicators of individual loan purchase volume through the cash window in the immediately succeeding reporting period 
many purchase commitments entered into by farmer mac are mandatory delivery commitments 
if a seller obtains a mandatory commitment and is unable to deliver the loans required  farmer mac requires the seller to pay a fee to modify  extend or cancel the commitment 
as of december   outstanding commitments to purchase farmer mac i and ii loans totaled million  compared to million as of december  of the total farmer mac i and ii commitments outstanding as of december  and  million and million  respectively  were mandatory commitments 
loans submitted for approval or approved but not yet committed to purchase totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  not all of such loans are purchased  as some are denied for credit reasons or withdrawn by the seller 
balance sheet review assets 
as of december   total assets were billion compared to billion as of december  the increase in total assets was primarily due to growth in program assets farmer mac guaranteed securities and loans  which increased million during to a total of billion

total liabilities increased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  the increase in liabilities was primarily due to growth in notes payable  which corresponded to the growth in on balance sheet program assets 
the remaining increase in total liabilities was due to increases in accrued interest payable  the reserve for losses on farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and an increase in the liability for financial derivatives

risk management interest rate risk 
farmer mac is subject to interest rate risk on all assets held for investment because of possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities 
this risk is primarily related to loans held and farmer mac guaranteed securities because of the ability of borrowers to prepay their mortgages before the scheduled maturities  thereby increasing the risk of asset and liability cash flow mismatches 
cash flow mismatches in a changing interest rate environment can reduce the earnings of the corporation if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower yielding investments when farmer mac s funding costs cannot be correspondingly reduced  or if assets repay more slowly than expected and the associated debt must be replaced by higher cost debt 
yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties contained in many agricultural mortgage loans reduce  but do not eliminate  this risk 
those provisions require borrowers to make an additional payment when they prepay their loans  so that  when reinvested with the prepaid principal  yield maintenance payments generate substantially the same cash flows that would have been generated had the loan not prepaid 
this creates a disincentive to prepayment and compensates the corporation for its interest rate risks to a large degree 
as of december   percent of the outstanding balance of all loans held and loans underlying on balance sheet farmer mac i guaranteed securities including percent of all loans with fixed interest rates were covered by yield maintenance provisions and other prepayment penalties 
as of december   percent of the total outstanding balance of retained farmer mac i loans and guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions and percent had another form of prepayment protection 
of the farmer mac i new and current loans purchased in  percent had yield maintenance or another form of prepayment protection including percent of all loans with fixed interest rates 
none of the usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities had yield maintenance provisions 
the goal of interest rate risk management at farmer mac is to create a portfolio that generates stable earnings and value across a variety of interest rate environments 
farmer mac s primary strategy for managing interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar durations so that they will perform similarly as interest rates change 
to achieve this match  farmer mac issues discount notes and both callable and non callable medium term notes across a spectrum of maturities and purchases financial derivatives to alter the duration of its liabilities and so its interest rate sensitivities 
by using a blend of liabilities that includes callable debt  the interest rate sensitivities of the liabilities tend to increase or decrease as interest rates change in a manner similar to changes in the interest rate sensitivities of the assets 
farmer mac s million of cash and cash equivalents as of december  matures within three months and are match funded with discount notes having similar maturities 
investment securities of million as of december  consist of million percent of floating rate securities that all have rates that adjust within one year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on investment securities 
these floating rate investments are funded using a series of discount note issuances 
each successive discount note issuance matures on or about the corresponding repricing date of the related investment 
farmer mac is also subject to interest rate risk on loans  including loans that farmer mac has committed to acquire but has not yet purchased 
when farmer mac commits to purchase a loan  it is exposed to interest rate risk between the time it commits to purchase the loan and the time it either o sells farmer mac guaranteed securities backed by the loan  or o issues debt to retain the loan in its portfolio although issuing debt to fund the loan as an investment does not fully eliminate interest rate risk due to the possible timing differences in the cash flows of the assets and related liabilities  as discussed above 
farmer mac manages the interest rate risk related to such loans  and any related farmer mac guaranteed securities or debt issuance  through the use of forward sale contracts on the debt and mortgage backed securities of other government sponsored enterprises and futures contracts involving us treasury securities 
farmer mac uses government sponsored enterprise forward sale contracts to reduce its interest rate exposure to changes in both treasury rates and spreads on farmer mac debt and farmer mac i guaranteed securities 
since interest rate sensitivity may change with the passage of time and as interest rates change  farmer mac assesses this exposure on a regular basis and rebalances its portfolio of assets and liabilities as necessary through o the purchase of mortgage assets in the ordinary course of business  o the refunding of existing liabilities  or o the use of derivatives to alter the characteristics of existing assets or liabilities 
the most strenuous measure of farmer mac s interest rate risk is the sensitivity of its market value of equity mve to parallel yield curve shocks 
mve represents the present value of all future cash flows from on and off balance sheet assets  liabilities and financial derivatives  discounted at current interest rates and spreads 
the following schedule summarizes the results of farmer mac s mve sensitivity analysis as of december  and december  to an immediate and instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve 
percentage change in mve from base case interest rate december  december  scenario bp bp bp bp bp n a bp n a as of december   a bp parallel shift of the u 
s 
treasury yield curve produced negative interest rates for maturities of years and shorter 
while farmer mac s interest rate sensitivity increased during  it remained relatively stable and at relatively low levels despite the volatile interest rate environment 
during  interest rates fell to historic lows and interest rate volatility increased significantly 
as interest rates declined dramatically and prepayments increased  the duration of farmer mac s assets that do not have prepayment protection shortened somewhat more than that of its liabilities  causing a widening of farmer mac s effective duration gap  another standard measure of interest rate risk 
farmer mac s effective duration gap was minus months as of december   compared to minus month as of december  this environment also caused mve and net interest income nii to show positive sensitivity to increasing interest rates and negative sensitivity to continued decreases in interest rates 
nii sensitivity  a shorter term measure of interest rate risk  demonstrated a similar change in its exposures to interest rate movements 
as of december   a uniform or parallel increase of basis points would increase nii by percent  while a parallel decrease of basis points would decrease nii by percent 
farmer mac also measures the sensitivity of both mve and nii to a variety of non parallel interest rate shocks  including flattening and steepening yield curve scenarios 
both mve and nii continue to be less sensitive to non parallel shocks than to the parallel shocks 
the sensitivity of farmer mac s mve and nii to both parallel and non parallel interest rate shocks  and its duration gap  indicate the effectiveness of the corporation s approach to managing its interest rate risk exposures 
the economic effects of financial derivatives  including interest rate swaps  are included in the mve  nii and duration gap analyses 
farmer mac generally enters into various interest rate swaps to reduce interest rate risk as follows o floating to fixed interest rate swaps in which it pays fixed rates of interest to  and receives floating rates of interest from  counterparties  these adjust the characteristics of short term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of longer term reset and fixed rate mortgages and other assets and provide an overall lower effective cost of borrowing than would otherwise be available in the conventional debt market  o fixed to floating interest rate swaps in which it receives fixed rates of interest from  and pays floating rates of interest to  counterparties  these adjust the characteristics of long term debt to match more closely the cash flow and duration characteristics of short term assets  and o basis swaps in which it pays variable rates of interest based on one index to  and receives variable rates of interest based on another index from  counterparties  these alter interest rate indices of liabilities to match those of assets  and vice versa 
as of december   farmer mac had billion combined notional amount of interest rate swaps  of which million were floating to fixed interest rate swaps  million were basis swaps and million were fixed to floating interest rate swaps  with terms ranging from one to fifteen years 
farmer mac uses financial derivatives as an end user for hedging purposes  not for trading or speculative purposes 
when financial derivatives meet the specific hedge criteria under sfas  they are accounted for as either fair value hedges or cash flow hedges 
financial derivatives that do not satisfy those hedge criteria are not accounted for as hedges and changes in the fair value of those financial derivatives are reported as a gain or loss on financial derivatives and trading assets in the statement of operations 
all of farmer mac s derivatives transactions are conducted under standard collateralized agreements that limit farmer mac s potential credit exposure to any counterparty 
as of december   farmer mac had no uncollateralized net exposure to any counterparty 
credit risk loans 
farmer mac s primary exposure to credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from the inability of borrowers to repay their mortgages 
farmer mac is exposed to credit risk on o loans it holds  o loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities  and o loans underlying ltspcs 
loans held or loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs can be divided into four groups o loans held for investment  o loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  o loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or ltspcs  and o usda guaranteed portions underlying farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
for loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities  ten percent first loss subordinated interests mitigate farmer mac s credit risk exposure 
before farmer mac incurs a credit loss  full recourse must first be taken against the subordinated interest 
the act eliminated the subordinated interest requirement 
as a result  farmer mac generally assumes percent of the credit risk on loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
farmer mac s credit exposure on usda guaranteed portions is covered by the full faith and credit of the united states 
farmer mac believes it has little or no credit risk exposure to loans underlying pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities because of the subordinated interests  or to usda guaranteed portions because of the usda guarantee 
the outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs is summarized in the table below 
as of december  in thousands farmer mac i post act   pre act   farmer mac ii usda guaranteed portions   for several years  farmer mac has conducted guarantee fee adequacy analyses  using stress test models developed internally and with the assistance of outside experts 
these analyses have taken into account the diverse and dissimilar characteristics of the various asset categories for which farmer mac manages its risk exposures  and have evolved as the mix and character of assets under management has shifted with growth in the business and the addition of new asset categories 
based on current information  farmer mac believes that its guarantee fee is adequate compensation for the credit risk that it assumes 
farmer mac has established underwriting and appraisal standards for all post act loans and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
those standards are designed to mitigate the risk of loss from borrower defaults and to provide guidance concerning the management  administration and conduct of underwriting and appraisals to all participants in its programs 
the standards were developed on the basis of industry norms for agricultural mortgage loans and are designed to assess the creditworthiness of the borrower  as well as the value of the mortgaged property relative to the amount of the mortgage loan 
farmer mac requires sellers to make representations and warranties regarding the conformity of eligible mortgage loans to these standards and other requirements it may impose from time to time 
detailed information regarding farmer mac s underwriting and appraisal standards and seller eligibility requirements are presented in business farmer mac i underwriting and appraisal standards and business farmer mac i sellers 
farmer mac maintains an allowance for losses to cover estimated probable losses on loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas and statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas 
the methodology for determining the allowance for losses is the same for loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs because farmer mac believes the ultimate credit risk is the same  ie  the underlying agricultural mortgage loans all meet the same credit underwriting and appraisal standards 
for accepting the credit risk on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  farmer mac receives guarantee fees and commitment fees  respectively 
for loans held  farmer mac receives interest income that includes a component that correlates to its guarantee fee  which farmer mac views as compensation for accepting credit risk 
no allowance for losses has been made for loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act or farmer mac ii guaranteed securities 
farmer mac i guaranteed securities issued prior to the act are supported by unguaranteed first loss subordinated interests  which are expected to exceed the estimated credit losses on those loans 
usda guaranteed portions collateralizing farmer mac ii guaranteed securities are obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the united states 
to date  farmer mac has experienced no credit losses on any pre act farmer mac i guaranteed securities or on any farmer mac ii guaranteed securities and does not expect to incur any such losses in the future 
the allowance for losses is presented in three components on the consolidated balance sheet o an allowance for loan losses on loans held for investment  o a valuation allowance on real estate owned  which is included in the balance sheet under real estate owned net of valuation allowance  and o an allowance for losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  which is included in the balance sheet under reserve for losses 
the provision for losses is presented in two components on the consolidated statement of operations o a provision for loan losses  which represents losses on farmer mac s loans held for investment  and o a provision for losses  which represents losses on loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs and real estate owned 
during the year ended december   farmer mac reclassified certain components of its allowance for losses and its provision for losses to further clarify its presentation 
reclassifications of the allowance for losses and provision for losses for prior periods were made to conform to the current period presentation 
these reclassifications are for presentation purposes only and have no impact on farmer mac s risk exposure  results from operations or financial position 
see note j  note q and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
farmer mac s allowance for losses is estimated using a systematic process that begins with management s evaluation of the results of its proprietary loan pool simulation and guarantee fee model the model  those results may be modified by the application of management judgment that takes into account factors including o economic conditions  o geographic and agricultural commodity concentrations of farmer mac s portfolio  o the credit profile of farmer mac s portfolio  o delinquency trends of farmer mac s portfolio  and o historical charge off and recovery activity of farmer mac s portfolio 
the model offers historical loss experience on agricultural mortgage loans similar to those on which farmer mac has assumed credit risk  but over a longer term than farmer mac s own experience to date 
farmer mac s systematic methodology for determining its allowance for losses is expected to migrate over time  away from the model and toward the increased use of farmer mac s own historical portfolio loss experience  as that experience continues to develop 
during this migration  farmer mac will continue to use the results from the model  augmented by the application of management s judgment  to develop its loan loss allowance 
management believes that its use of this methodology produces a reliable estimate of total probable losses  as of the balance sheet date  for all loans included in farmer mac s portfolio  including loans held for investment and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs 
in addition  farmer mac specifically analyzes its portfolio of non performing assets loans days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan  and reo on a loan by loan basis 
this analysis measures impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral for each individual loan relative to the total amount due  including principal  interest and advances under sfas in the event that the updated appraisal or management s estimate of discounted collateral value does not support the total amount due  farmer mac specifically determines an allowance for the loan for the difference between the recorded investment and its fair value  less estimated costs to liquidate the collateral 
management believes that the general allowance  which is the difference between the total allowance for losses generated through use of the model and the specific allowances  adequately covers any losses inherent in the portfolio of performing loans under sfas farmer mac considers that the methodology described above produces a reliable estimate of the total probable losses inherent in the farmer mac portfolio 
the model o runs various configurations of loan types  terms  economic conditions  and borrower eligibility criteria to generate a distribution of loss exposures over time for all loans in the portfolio  o uses historical agricultural real estate loan origination and servicing data that reflect varied economic conditions and stress levels in the agricultural sector  o contains features that allow variations for changes in loan portfolio characteristics to make the data set more representative of farmer mac s portfolio and credit underwriting standards  and o considers the effects of the ageing of the loan portfolio along the expected loss curves associated with individual cohort origination years  including the segments that are entering into or coming out of their peak default years 
farmer mac analyzes various iterations of the model data to evaluate its overall allowance for loss and back tests the results to validate the model 
such tests use prior period data to project losses expected in a current period  and compare those projections to actual losses incurred during the current period 
the allowance for losses is increased through periodic provisions for losses charged to expense and reduced by charge offs for actual losses  net of recoveries that are recognized if liquidation proceeds exceed previous estimates 
charge offs represent losses on the outstanding principal balance  any interest payments previously accrued or advanced and expected costs of liquidation 
the following table summarizes the changes in the components of the allowance for losses for each year in the three year period ended december  allowance reo total for loan valuation reserve allowance losses allowance for losses for losses in thousands balances as of january    provision for losses   net charge offs balances as of december    provision for losses   net allocation of allowance net charge offs   balances as of december     provision for losses    net allocation of allowance    net charge offs   balances as of december     when certain criteria are met  such as the default of the borrower  farmer mac has the option to purchase the defaulted loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and is obligated to purchase those underlying an ltspc 
these acquisitions are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at their fair value 
fair value is determined by appraisal or management s estimate of discounted collateral value 
in september  farmer mac adopted eitf issue  accounting for changes that result in a transferor regaining control of financial assets sold the consensus or eitf 
the consensus requires that farmer mac record  at acquisition  the difference between each loan s acquisition cost and its fair value  if any  as a charge to the reserve for losses 
prior to the adoption of the consensus  any specific allowance that had been established for the off balance sheet obligation would have been transferred from the reserve for losses to the allowance for loan losses referred to as net allocation of the allowance in the table below 
upon the receipt of each loan s updated appraisal or determination of management s estimate of discounted collateral value  the difference between the acquisition cost of the loan and its fair value  if any  was recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses 
farmer mac s total provision for losses was million for  compared to million for during  farmer mac charged off million in losses against the allowance for losses and recovered million from previously charged off losses  for net charge offs of million 
the net charge offs for included million related to previously accrued or advanced interest on loans or farmer mac i guaranteed securities  compared to million for as of december   farmer mac s allowance for losses totaled million  or basis points of the outstanding principal balance of loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million basis points as of december  the year to year decline in this ratio is a result of a large increase in the outstanding portfolio during compared to the provisions for probable losses directly related to those loans 
as of december   loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs that were days or more past due  in foreclosure  restructured after delinquency  in bankruptcy including loans performing under either their original loan terms or a court approved bankruptcy plan and real estate owned post act non performing assets totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  loans that have been restructured after delinquency were insignificant and are included within the reported day delinquency and non performing asset disclosures 
as of december   farmer mac s day delinquencies totaled million and represented percent of the principal balance of all loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  compared to million percent as of december  from quarter to quarter  farmer mac anticipates the day delinquencies will fluctuate  both in dollars and as a percentage of the outstanding portfolio  with higher levels likely at the end of the first and third quarters of each year corresponding to the semi annual january st and july st payment characteristics of most farmer mac i loans

as of december   approximately billion percent of farmer mac s outstanding loans held and loans underlying post act farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs were in their peak delinquency and default years compared to billion percent of such loans as of december  the model takes the portfolio age distribution and maturation into consideration 
accordingly  those trends did not cause management to alter the model s projection for the provisions for losses 
as of december   farmer mac s loan by loan analysis of its million of non performing assets and their updated appraisals or management s estimates of discounted values indicated that million had insufficient collateral to cover the loan balance  accrued interest and expenses 
farmer mac has specifically allocated million of allowances to those under collateralized loans 
farmer mac s loan by loan analyses indicated that the remaining million of non performing assets were adequately collateralized  based on updated appraisals or management s estimates of discounted collateral values  and that the allocation of specific allowances to those loans was not necessary 
as of december   after the allocation of specific allowances to under collateralized loans  farmer mac had additional non specific or general allowances of million  bringing the total allowance for losses to million

based on farmer mac s loan by loan analyses  loan collection experience and continuing provisions for the allowance for losses  farmer mac believes that ongoing losses will be covered adequately by the allowance for losses 
original loan to value ratios are one of many factors farmer mac considers in evaluating loss severity 
other factors include  but are not limited to  other underwriting standards  commodity and farming forecasts and regional economic and agricultural conditions 
loans in the farmer mac i program are all first mortgage agricultural real estate loans 
accordingly  farmer mac s exposure on a loan is limited to the difference between the principal balance of a loan and the value of the property 
measurement of that excess or shortfall is the best predictor and determinant of loss compared to other measures that evaluate the efficiency of a particular farm operator 
loan to value ratios depend upon the economic value of a property with due regard for its income producing potential in the hands of a competent operator 
as required by farmer mac s collateral valuation standards  an appraisal of agricultural real estate must include analysis of the income producing capability of the property and address the income estimate in the market analysis 
debt service ratios depend upon farm operator efficiency and leverage  which can vary widely within a geographic region  commodity type  or an operator s business and farming skills 
as of december   the weighted average original loan to value ratio for all post act loans and loans underlying farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs was percent  and the weighted average original loan to value ratio for all post act non performing assets was percent 
the following table summarizes the post act non performing assets by original loan to value ratio calculated by dividing the loan principal balance at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment by the appraised value at the date of loan origination or  when available  updated appraised value at the time of guarantee  purchase or commitment distribution of post act non performing assets as of december  dollars in thousands post act non performing original ltv ratio assets percentage to  to  to  to  to  total  the following table presents outstanding loans held and loans underlying farmer mac i guaranteed securities and ltspcs  post act non performing assets and specific allowances for losses as of december  by year of origination  geographic region and commodity

an analysis of farmer mac s historical losses and identified specific collateral deficiencies within the portfolio by origination year indicates that farmer mac has experienced peak loss years as loans have aged between approximately their third and fifth years subsequent to origination  regardless of the year the loans were added to the farmer mac s portfolio 
as a consequence of the combination of principal amortization and collateral value appreciation  there are few loans in the portfolio originated prior to with known collateral deficiencies 
while farmer mac expects that there will be loans that have aged past their fifth year that will become delinquent and possibly default  farmer mac does not anticipate significant losses on such loans 
analysis of the portfolio by its geographic distribution indicates that losses and collateral deficiencies have been and are expected to remain most prevalent in the loans concentrated in the areas that do not receive significant government support 
this analysis is consistent with corresponding commodity analysis  which indicates that farmer mac has experienced higher loss and collateral deficiency rates in its loans classified as permanent plantings 
most of the loans classified as permanent plantings do not receive significant government support and are therefore more susceptible to adverse commodity specific economic trends 
further  as adverse economic conditions persist for a particular commodity that requires a long term improvement on the land  such as permanent plantings  the prospective sale value of the land is likely to decrease and the related loans may become under collateralized 
farmer mac anticipates that one or more particular commodity groups will be under economic pressure at any one time and actively manages its portfolio to mitigate concentration risks while preserving farmer mac s ability to meet the financing needs of all commodity groups 
farmer mac s methodologies for pricing its guarantee and commitment fees  managing credit risks and providing adequate allowances for losses consider all of the foregoing factors and information 
credit risk institutional 
farmer mac is also exposed to credit risk arising from its business relationships with other institutions including o issuers of agvantage bonds and other investments held by farmer mac  o sellers and servicers  and o interest rate contract counterparties 
agvantage bonds are general obligations of the agvantage issuers and are secured by collateral in an amount ranging from percent to percent of the bond amount 
in addition to requiring collateral  farmer mac mitigates credit risk related to agvantage bonds by evaluating and monitoring the financial condition of the issuers of the agvantage bonds 
outstanding agvantage bonds totaled million as of december   and million as of december  farmer mac manages institutional credit risk related to sellers and servicers by requiring those institutions to meet farmer mac s standards for creditworthiness 
farmer mac monitors the financial condition of those institutions by evaluating financial statements and bank credit rating agency reports and confirms that they maintain adequate fidelity bonds and errors and omissions insurance 
for more information on farmer mac s approval of sellers  see business general sellers 
credit risk related to interest rate contracts is discussed in risk management interest rate risk and note to the consolidated financial statements 
credit risk other investments 
the credit risk inherent in other investments held by farmer mac is mitigated by farmer mac s policies of investing in highly rated instruments and establishing concentration limits  which reduce exposure to any one counterparty 
farmer mac s policies limit the corporation s total credit exposure  including uncollateralized credit exposure resulting from financial derivatives  to a single entity by limiting the dollar amount of investments with each individual entity to the greater of percent of farmer mac s regulatory core capital or million 
that limitation excludes exposure to agencies of the us government  government sponsored enterprises and money market funds 
farmer mac policy also requires each individual entity to be rated in one of the three highest rating categories of at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization for investments with terms greater than days and in one of the two highest rating categories for investments with terms of days or less 
as of december   farmer mac had investments in commercial paper  corporate debt securities  asset backed securities and preferred stock issued by forty three entities totaling million 
farmer mac s investments in eighteen of these entities each exceeded percent of farmer mac s core capital the cumulative balance of investments in such entities totaled million  and investments in two of these entities each exceeded percent of core capital 
in addition  as of december   farmer mac held million of securities issued by government sponsored enterprises or agencies of the us government and million in five money market investment accounts 
the maximum amount held in any one money market fund investment fund at any time during was approximately million 
as of december   percent of the investment portfolio  excluding government sponsored enterprise and agency investments  consisted of short term highly liquid investments 
liquidity and capital resources farmer mac has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to support its operations for the next twelve months 
debt issuance 
section e of farmer mac s statutory charter usc ss 
aa e authorizes farmer mac to issue debt obligations to purchase eligible mortgage loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities and to maintain reasonable amounts for business operations  including adequate liquidity 
farmer mac funds its program purchases primarily by issuing debt obligations of various maturities in the public capital markets 
farmer mac s debt obligations consist of discount notes and medium term notes issued to obtain funds principally to cover the costs of purchasing and holding loans and securities including farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac also issues discount notes and medium term notes to obtain funds for investments  transaction costs and guarantee payments 
the corporation s discount notes and medium term notes are obligations of farmer mac only  are not rated by any rating agency and the interest and principal thereon are not guaranteed by and do not constitute debts or obligations of the farm credit administration or the united states or any agency or instrumentality of the united states other than farmer mac 
farmer mac is an institution of the farm credit system  but is not liable for any debt or obligation of any other institution of the farm credit system 
likewise  neither the farm credit system nor any other individual institution of the farm credit system is liable for any debt or obligation of farmer mac 
federal law does not exempt income on a farmer mac discount note or medium term note from federal  state or local taxation 
effective june   farmer mac s board of directors has authorized the issuance of up to billion of discount notes and medium term notes of which billion was outstanding as of december   subject to periodic review of the adequacy of that level relative to farmer mac s borrowing requirements 
farmer mac invests the proceeds of such issuances in loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities and non program investment assets in accordance with guidelines established by its board of directors 
liquidity 
the funding and liquidity needs of farmer mac s business programs are driven by the purchase and retention of loans and farmer mac guaranteed securities  the maturities of farmer mac s discount notes and medium term notes and payment of principal and interest on farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac s primary sources of funds to meet these needs are o principal and interest payments and ongoing guarantee and commitment fees received on loans  farmer mac guaranteed securities and ltspcs  and o the issuance of new discount notes and medium term notes 
farmer mac projects its expected cash flows from loans and securities  other earnings and the sale of assets and matches those with its obligations to retire debt and pay other liabilities as they come due 
farmer mac issues discount notes and medium term notes to meet the needs associated with its business operations  including liquidity  and also to increase its presence in the capital markets in order to enhance the liquidity and pricing efficiency of its discount notes and medium term notes and farmer mac guaranteed securities transactions and so improve the mortgage rates available to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners 
though farmer mac s mortgage purchases do not currently necessitate daily debt issuance  the corporation continued its strategy of using its non program investment portfolio referred to as farmer mac s liquidity portfolio to facilitate increasing its ongoing presence in the capital markets during to meet investor demand for daily presence in the capital markets  farmer mac issues discount notes in maturities ranging from one day to approximately days and invests the proceeds not needed for program asset purchases in highly rated securities 
investments are predominantly short term money market securities with maturities closely matched to the discount note maturities and floating rate securities with reset terms of less than one year and closely matched to the maturity of the discount notes 
the positive spread earned from these investments enhances the net interest income farmer mac earns  thereby improving the net yields at which farmer mac can purchase mortgages from lenders who may pass that benefit to farmers  ranchers and rural homeowners through the farmer mac programs 
subject to dollar limitations  the corporation s board of directors has authorized non program investments in o us treasury obligations  o agency and instrumentality obligations  o repurchase agreements  o commercial paper  o guaranteed investment contracts  o certificates of deposit  o federal funds and bankers acceptances  o certain securities and debt obligations of corporate and municipal issuers  o asset backed securities  o corporate money market funds  and o preferred stock of government sponsored enterprises 
as of december   farmer mac was in compliance with the dollar limitations and investment authorizations set forth in its investment guidelines

as a result of farmer mac s regular issuance of discount notes and medium term notes and its status as a federally chartered instrumentality of the united states  farmer mac has been able to access the capital markets at favorable rates 
throughout the recent period of inaccurate and misleading publicity about the corporation  farmer mac has maintained regular daily access to the discount note market at rates comparable to the issuance and trading levels of other government sponsored enterprise discount notes 
farmer mac s continued ability to access the discount note market at such favorable rates could be affected by continued inaccurate and misleading publicity about farmer mac or unusual trading in its securities 
farmer mac believes such factors caused spread levels in secondary market trading of its outstanding medium term notes to widen during second quarter although those spreads appeared to improve in the second half of and farmer mac returned to issuing medium term notes on a limited basis at favorable issuance spreads during the second half of  the foregoing factors could affect future medium term note issuance spreads adversely and cause farmer mac to continue to emphasize floating to fixed interest rate swaps  combined with discount note issuances  as a source of fixed rate funding 
while the swap market provides favorable fixed rates  swap transactions expose farmer mac to the risk of future widening of its own issuance spreads versus corresponding libor rates 
if the spreads on the farmer mac discount notes were to increase relative to libor  farmer mac would be exposed to a commensurate reduction on its net interest yield on the notional amount of its floating to fixed interest rate swaps and other libor based floating rate assets 
farmer mac compensates for this risk by pricing the required net yield on program asset purchases to reflect the higher cost of medium term notes issuance without regard to the savings achieved in the interest rate swap market 
farmer mac maintains an investment portfolio of cash and cash equivalents including commercial paper and other short term money market instruments and investment securities consisting mostly of floating rate securities that reprice within one year  which can be drawn upon for liquidity needs 
as of december   farmer mac s cash and cash equivalents and investment securities totaled million and million  respectively  a combined percent of total assets 
for  exclusive of daily overnight discount note issuances that were invested overnight  the average discount note issuance term and re funding frequency was approximately days 
the principal sources of funding for the payment of farmer mac s obligations under its guarantees and ltspcs are the fees for its guarantees and commitments  net interest income and the proceeds of debt issuance 
farmer mac satisfies its guarantee and purchase commitment obligations by purchasing defaulted loans out of ltspcs and from the related trusts for farmer mac guaranteed securities 
farmer mac typically recovers a significant portion of the value of defaulted loans purchased either through borrower payments  loan payoffs  payments by third parties or foreclosure and sale 
farmer mac s liquidity position and ready access to the debt markets also provide additional flexibility to meet liquidity needs that result from the uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of required purchases of loans underlying either farmer mac guaranteed securities or ltspcs  should significantly more loans be required to be purchased than in prior periods 
capital requirements 
the act  as amended by the act  establishes three capital standards for farmer mac minimum  critical and risk based 
the minimum capital requirement is expressed as a percentage of on balance sheet assets and off balance sheet obligations  with the critical capital requirement equal to one half of the minimum capital amount 
higher minimum and critical capital requirements were phased in over a transition period  which ended on january   when the highest level of minimum capital became applicable 
the act does not specify the required level of risk based capital 
it directs fca to establish a risk based capital test for farmer mac  using specified stress test parameters 
for a discussion of risk based capital  see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards risk based capital 
certain enforcement powers are given to fca depending upon farmer mac s compliance with the capital standards 
see government regulation of farmer mac regulation capital standards enforcement levels 
as of december  and  farmer mac was classified as within level i the highest compliance level 
the following table sets forth farmer mac s minimum capital requirement as of december  and based on the fully phased in requirements 
december  december  capital capital amount ratio required amount ratio required dollars in thousands on balance sheet assets as defined for determining statutory minimum capital     outstanding balance of farmer mac guaranteed securities held by others and ltspcs     derivative and hedging obligations   minimum capital level   actual core capital   capital surplus   based on the current minimum capital requirements established in the act  farmer mac s current capital surplus of million would support additional guarantee growth in amounts ranging from billion of on balance sheet guarantees to more than billion of off balance sheet guarantees 
furthermore  should farmer mac deem it appropriate  on balance sheet non program assets cash and cash equivalents and investment securities of billion could be replaced with on and off balance sheet program guarantees  resulting in the ability to carry additional guarantees ranging from billion of on balance sheet guarantees to over billion of off balance sheet guarantees 
ultimately  farmer mac could sell on balance sheet program assets of billion in order to support further increases of on and off balance sheet program guarantees  resulting in the ability to carry an additional cumulative billion of off balance sheet guarantees 
any of these transactions would  of course  be evaluated to optimize farmer mac s return on equity and capital flexibility 
accordingly  in the opinion of management  farmer mac has sufficient capital and liquidity for the next twelve months
