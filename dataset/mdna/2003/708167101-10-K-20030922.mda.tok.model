item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general in july  pennfed became the savings and loan holding company of the bank 
currently  the results of operations of the company are primarily those of the bank and its subsidiaries and the trusts 
the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable laws  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
management strategy management s primary goal is to enhance stockholder value  while fostering and maintaining customer confidence through a continued focus on improved earnings while managing risks  including liquidity and interest rate risk 
the company s current strategies focus on i emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages  ii increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios  iii maintaining asset quality  iv increasing core deposit balances  v managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk  vi improving non interest income and vii controlling non interest expenses 
emphasizing lending secured by one to four family residential first mortgages 
the company will continue to emphasize production of traditional one to four family first mortgage loans secured by properties located primarily in new jersey 
the company produced million  million and million in one to four family mortgage loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company s interest income has been derived primarily from one to four family mortgage loans  which totaled million or of the company s gross loan portfolio at june  the company generally sells its conforming  fixed rate one to four family residential loan production 
during the year ended june   approximately million of conforming  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans were sold into the secondary market as part of the company s efforts to manage interest rate risk 
from time to time sales had been periodically suspended in certain circumstances 
for example  loans were held in portfolio as part of a leverage strategy associated with the trust preferred securities offering in march in addition  in fiscal the company sold approximately million of longer duration  one to four family residential mortgage loans in an effort to improve liquidity  interest rate risk and net interest margin 
total loans sold during fiscal and fiscal were million and million  respectively 
the level of loan sale activity continues to be actively evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk  long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan portfolios 
in addition to one to four family residential first mortgage lending  the company will continue its emphasis on increasing the commercial and multi family and consumer loan porfolios as a percentage of total loans 
these loans generally reprice more frequently  have shorter maturities  and or have higher yields than one to four family first mortgage loans 
the company originated million  million and million of commercial and multi family and consumer loans in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of june   and  commercial and multi family and consumer loans represented  and  respectively  of the total gross loan portfolio 
maintaining asset quality 
the company s loan portfolio consists primarily of one to four family mortgages  which are considered to have less risk than commercial and multi family real estate or consumer loans 
the company s non performing assets consist of non accruing loans and real estate owned 
the company focuses on strong underwriting and aggressive collection efforts and marketing of real estate owned properties 
non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were at june  increasing core deposit balances 
the company s primary source of funds is deposits 
the company will continue to emphasize growth in core deposits consisting of checking  money market and savings accounts 
the company utilizes various techniques to generate these types of deposits including special promotional rates and offerings 
core deposits increased million  or  in fiscal managing the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability committee that meets no less than monthly to develop  implement and review strategies and policies to manage interest rate risk 
as part of its interest rate risk strategy  the company has emphasized core deposits and utilized intermediate longer term borrowings and has  at select times  emphasized longer term certificates of deposit 
furthermore  the company has endeavored to manage its interest rate risk through the pricing and diversification of its loan products  including the focus on the production of loans with adjustable rate features and or with shorter terms to maturity 
the company has also engaged in one to four family mortgage loan sales whereby longer duration conventional loans have been sold 
see interest rate sensitivity and asset liability strategy 
improving non interest income 
the company has sought and will continue to seek additional ways of improving non interest income 
total service charges and other non interest income  excluding the net gain on sales of loans and real estate operations  reflected a million  or  increase for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to fees associated with various loan prepayments and or modifications and increased service charges related to checking accounts 
controlling non interest expenses 
non interest expenses are carefully monitored  which includes ongoing reviews of staffing levels  facilities and operations 
the company s ratio of non interest expenses to average total assets was for the year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which these assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a positive gap if the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest bearing liabilities than interest earning assets mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a negative gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment  in an institution with a positive gap  the yield on its rate sensitive assets would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities  thereby improving future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a positive gap would indicate that the yield on rate sensitive assets would decline at a faster pace than the cost of rate sensitive liabilities and diminish net interest income 
for an institution with a negative gap  the reverse would be expected 
in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee consisting of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer  the residential lending group executive  the retail banking group executive  the treasurer and the customer support operations group executive  which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board of directors reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position  including simulations of the effect on the company s capital and earnings of various interest rate scenarios and operational strategies 
the following table provides information about the company s interest sensitive financial instruments 
except for the effects of prepayments and scheduled principal amortization on mortgage related assets  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the earlier of term to repricing or contractual term to maturity 
investment securities and other includes certain money market holdings included within cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
callable government agency securities are assumed to be called within one year if their stated interest rates are at or above current market rates 
if the stated interest rate is below current market rates  these callable securities are assumed to be called at an estimated average life of approximately years 
residential fixed and adjustable rate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
commercial and multi family real estate loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and while consumer loans are assumed to prepay at a rate 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
demand loans and loans which have no repayment schedule or stated final maturity  are assumed to be due within six months 
loan and mortgage backed securities balances are net of non performing loans and are not adjusted for unearned discounts  premiums  and deferred loan fees 
the company assumes that variable rate savings account balances decay gradually over time 
based on historical information  of these balances roll off within one year  roll off in the second year  roll off in the third year  and roll off each year thereafter 
during fiscal and  the bank promoted savings for life accounts  which totaled million at june  these deposits are assumed to have an average life of approximately years 
in addition  a through june savings account was also promoted during fiscal at june   the balance in these accounts totaled million 
these deposits are assumed to have no decay through june and then roll off over the following four years 
the remainder is assumed to have an average life of years 
at june   million  or  of savings accounts are assumed to roll off after five years

the company s gap  though historically negative  remained in a positive position principally due to the continued decline in market interest rates 
lower rates have resulted in the early redemption of certain investment securities with callable features and has increased prepayment activity on residential mortgage loans  thereby shifting a larger portion of estimated asset cash flows to within one year 
the proceeds from such activities were partially reinvested in investment securities but were also used to fund certificate of deposit outflows  which resulted in a decline in the company s asset size 
growth in core deposits coupled with a decline in short term certificates of deposit  including municipal certificates of deposit  reduced the short term estimated cash flows of the company s interest bearing liabilities 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of interest rate gap analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates in the short term and over the life of the asset 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
net portfolio value 
the company s interest rate sensitivity is regularly monitored by management through additional interest rate risk irr measures  including an irr exposure measure or post shock npv ratio and a sensitivity measure 
a low post shock npv ratio indicates greater exposure to irr 
greater exposure can result from a high sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity measure is the change in the npv ratio  in basis points  caused by a increase or decrease in rates  whichever produces a larger decline 
at least quarterly  and generally monthly  management models the change in net portfolio value npv over a variety of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
an npv ratio  in any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that rate scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
as of june   the bank s internally generated initial npv ratio was 
following a increase in interest rates  the bank s post shock npv ratio was 
the change in the npv ratio  or the bank s sensitivity measure  was positive 
as of june   the company s internally generated initial npv ratio was  the post shock ratio was  and the sensitivity measure was positive 
the duration of assets has declined principally due to increased prepayment estimates 
conversely  the duration of liabilities has extended principally due to the decline in short term fundings  both wholesale and retail  the extension of fhlb of new york advances and the growth in core deposits 
variances between the bank s and the company s npv ratios are attributable to balance sheet items which are adjusted during consolidation  such as investments  intercompany borrowings and capital 
internally generated npv measurements are based on simulations which utilize institution specific assumptions  including discount rates  and generally result in different levels of presumed interest rate risk generally lower than ots measurements indicate 
the ots measures the bank s irr on a quarterly basis using data from the quarterly thrift financial reports filed by the bank with the ots  coupled with non institution specific assumptions which are based on national averages 
as of june   the bank s initial npv ratio  as measured by the ots  was the bank s post shock ratio was and the sensitivity measure was negative in addition to monitoring npv and gap  management also monitors the duration of assets and liabilities and the effects on net interest income resulting from parallel and non parallel increases or decreases in rates 
at june   based on its internally generated simulation models  the company s consolidated net interest income projected for one year forward would increase from the base case  or current market  as a result of an immediate and sustained increase in interest rates 
asset liability strategy the primary elements of the company s asset liability strategy include the following the company has focused on shortening the average life and duration of its portfolio of one to four family mortgage loans by promoting one year adjustable rate products  with initial fixed rate terms of  and years   and year bi weekly mortgages and fixed rate products with terms of  and years 
the company has emphasized the origination of variable rate home equity lines of credit and fixed rate second mortgage loans as well as variable and fixed rate commercial and multi family real estate loans having maturities or terms to repricing significantly shorter than one to four family residential mortgage loans 
the company has periodically sold a portion of its one to four family whole mortgage loan portfolio in an effort to shorten its average life and duration  as well as to mitigate prepayment risk and reduce borrowings 
the level of such activity continues to be evaluated with primary consideration given to interest rate risk  long term profitability and liquidity objectives 
the company has emphasized the lengthening of maturities of its liabilities through its pricing of longer term certificates of deposit and by utilizing intermediate and longer term borrowings  subject to market conditions 
the company has focused on developing and strengthening customer relationships in an effort to improve earnings and funding stability 
the company has also emphasized growth in core deposit accounts as these funds are relatively stable  have a longer duration and assist in strengthening customer relationships 
during fiscal  each of the strategies noted above was employed to manage the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
market rates during fiscal continued the downward trend that began late in fiscal the rapid decline in short term rates in the first half of the current fiscal year was followed by an even larger decline in longer term rates in the second half  leading to a flattening in the yield curve 
this shift in rates to historically low levels resulted in a significant increase in prepayments on residential one to four family mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities 
in an effort to retain residential mortgage customers  fixed rate borrowers who desired to refinance their mortgages were offered an opportunity to participate in a rate modification program 
through this program the bank retained the seasoned loan only the rate on the seasoned loan decreased 
in addition  as rates declined  early redemptions in the company s u 
s 
government agency securities portfolio increased 
each of these events resulted in a gradual decline in the company s yield on earning assets  and  though funding costs also fell  they did not keep pace with the decline in asset yields 
as a result  the net interest rate spread deteriorated 
as yields on reinvestment opportunities dropped  and newly originated mortgage loans were modifying or prepaying in larger numbers  the bank responded by allowing its asset size to decrease 
the origination and subsequent sale of conforming  fixed rate residential loans was emphasized 
efforts to establish new opportunities for jumbo loan sale activities were also explored 
simultaneously  consumer and commercial and multi family real estate loan originations were successfully supported through special pricing and promotional endeavors 
funding strategies included a focus on building core deposit relationships through special promotions and pricing 
though premium pricing  especially for certificates of deposit  was avoided throughout fiscal  personal and business core deposit relationships continued to grow 
this funding growth  combined with increased asset cashflows  contributed to a significant improvement in the company s sensitivity to rising rates  however  growth in premium savings balances contributed to the decline in internally generated npv measurements as their simulated value deteriorated as market rates declined 
as a result of the above activity  one to four family first mortgage loan balances declined million between june  and june   adjustable rate balances fell million while fixed rate balances decreased million 
consumer loan balances declined million 
prime based home equity lines of credit fell million while other consumer products  principally fixed rate second mortgages generally with shorter durations than one to four family residential mortgages  increased million 
commercial and multi family real estate loan balances grew million during the current fiscal year with million of the growth in adjustable rate products 
at june   medium and long term certificates of deposits with remaining maturities greater than one year totaled million compared to million at june  certificates of deposit balances declined as premium pricing was avoided  but was partially offset by a million increase in core deposit balances 
checking and money market account balances grew million  while savings balances increased million 
wholesale borrowings with remaining maturities greater than one year totaled million at june   reflecting a decline of million during the current fiscal year 
however  million of convertible fhlb of new york advances with one time call options were not called and extended two to seven years to their final maturity 
short term retail deposit balances with remaining maturities less than one year  including municipal deposit balances  fell million while short term wholesale funding balances increased million between june  and june  as such borrowings shifted to within one year of maturity 
no new wholesale borrowings were added in fiscal except for an increase of million drawn on a line of credit 
the company emphasizes and promotes its savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  and certificates of deposit with varying maturities through five years  principally within its primary market areas 
the balances of savings  money market and demand deposit accounts  which represented approximately of total deposits at june   tend to be less susceptible to rapid changes in interest rates than certificates of deposit balances 
management will continue to monitor and employ such strategies  as necessary  in conjunction with its overall strategic objectives

the effects of accelerated prepayments on loans held to maturity and increased sales of conforming  fixed rate  one to four family residential mortgage loans held for sale into the secondary market have more than offset loan originations 
low market interest rates and the resulting effect of loan refinancing activity has led to an increase in the runoff of the mortgage backed securities portfolio

interest and dividend income 
interest and dividend income for the year ended june  decreased to million from million for the year ended june  in general  the decline in interest and dividend income reflects a lower level of interest earning assets due to the effects of loan sales and accelerated prepayments  and a lower yield earned on these assets as a result of prepayments of higher yielding loans and origination of loans at lower market interest rates 
average interest earning assets were billion for the year ended june  compared to billion for the prior fiscal year 
the average yield earned on interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  interest income on residential one to four family mortgage loans for the year ended june  decreased million when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest income on residential one to four family mortgage loans was due to a decrease in the average yield earned on this loan portfolio to for the year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year  reflecting the payoff or refinance of higher yielding loans and the origination of lower yielding loans 
in addition  the decrease in interest income on residential one to four family mortgage loans for the year ended june  was due to a decrease in the average balance outstanding to billion from billion for the prior year as the result of accelerated prepayments and loan sales 
interest income on commercial and multi family real estate loans increased million for the year ended june  when compared to the prior year 
at june   commercial and multi family real estate loans represented approximately of the company s gross loan portfolio as compared to at june  the increase in interest income on commercial and multi family real estate loans was attributable to an increase of million in the average outstanding balance for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
the growth in interest income on this portfolio was partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned on commercial and multi family real estate loans 
the average yield decreased to for the current year compared to for the year ended june  as with other loans  the payoff of higher yielding loans and the origination of loans at lower market interest rates has resulted in a decline in the yield of the commercial and multi family real estate loan portfolio 
interest income on consumer loans decreased  for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
the decrease in interest income for this loan portfolio was reflective of the lower market interest rates 
the average yield earned on consumer loans decreased to for the year ended june  from for the prior year 
in addition  the decrease in interest income on consumer loans was attributable to a decrease of million in the average balance outstanding for the year ended june  when compared to the year ended june  interest income on investment securities and other interest earning assets decreased million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
the interest income on investment securities and other interest earning assets for the current year was negatively impacted by a decline in the average yield earned on these securities 
the average yield decreased to for the year ended june  compared to for the prior year as called investment securities were replaced with lower yielding investments 
the decrease in interest income on these securities was partially offset by a million increase in the average balance outstanding for the year ended june   when compared to the prior year 
as a partial offset to the reduction in loans and mortgage backed securities due to increased prepayments  additional investment securities were purchased during the fiscal year 
interest income on the mortgage backed securities portfolio decreased million for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
the average balance outstanding of mortgage backed securities decreased million for the year ended june  when compared to the prior year period  primarily due to accelerated prepayments

interest expense 
interest expense decreased million for the year ended june  from fiscal the decrease in the current year was attributable to a decrease in the company s cost of funds to an average rate of for the year ended june  from for the prior year  as a result of lower market interest rates 
the decrease in interest expense for the year ended june  was also attributable to a million decrease in total average deposits and borrowings  when compared to the year ended june  for the year ended june   the average rate paid on deposits decreased to from for the year ended june  average deposit balances decreased million from billion for the year ended june  to billion for the current year 
continued low interest rates during the current year resulted in a decrease in the balance of certificates of deposit while growth in core deposits slowed 
with a reduction in the company s funding needs as a result of loan sales and accelerated loan prepayments  higher costing certificates of deposit were priced to allow runoff

average net interest earning assets decreased million for the year ended june  when compared to the prior year 
the net interest rate spread and net interest margin for the year ended june  were and  respectively  a decrease from and for the comparable prior year 
the net interest margin was reduced during the current year when compared to the prior year principally due to the effect of accelerated prepayments resulting from lower market interest rates 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses for the year ended june  was  compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the reduced provision for loan losses for the current year is consistent with reductions in non performing loans

see item business critical accounting policy 
non interest income 
for the year ended june   non interest income was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in non interest income was primarily due to increases in service charges and net gain on sales of loans  when compared to the year ended june  service charge income for the year ended june  was million  reflecting an increase of million over the million recorded for the prior year 
service charges increased partially due to fees associated with various loan prepayments and or modifications and partially due to increased service charges related to checking accounts 
during the year ended june   the net gain on sales of loans was million compared to  for the year ended june  approximately million of conforming  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans were sold into the secondary market during the year ended june  additionally  during the current year  the company recognized a  gain on a commitment to sell one to four family residential mortgage loans to a financial institution 
furthermore  during the current year  a million commercial real estate loan participation was sold as a means to reduce the company s credit exposure on a single commercial real estate property  resulting in a net gain of approximately  during the prior fiscal year  loan production was retained in portfolio 
effective with the issuance of million of trust preferred securities in march  a determination was made to suspend the sale of conforming  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loan production to leverage the proceeds of the issuance 
as a result  only million of conforming  fixed rate one to four family residential mortgage loans were sold during the year ended june  in april  the company resumed the sale of these loans for interest rate risk management purposes in a lower interest rate environment

as a result of the redemption of trust i trust preferred securities  the company recognized a non recurring expense of approximately million  or per share  associated with the unamortized issuance costs related to these securities 
the company anticipates that this additional expense will be largely offset in the next fiscal year by the savings realized due to a lower interest rate on the junior subordinated debentures issued in connection with the trust iii offering as compared to the trust preferred securities issued by trust i 
the company s non interest expenses as a percent of average assets increased to for the year ended june  from for the prior year
