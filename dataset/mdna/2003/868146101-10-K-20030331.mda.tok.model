item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are organized into the two business segments of outsourcing and consulting 
the outsourcing segment helps healthcare providers simplify their management agendas  improve their return on information systems investment and strengthen their technology management by taking on responsibility for managing and operating all or part of the client s it functions 
we deploy specialized resources to deliver higher quality it functionality at lower cost and help clients avoid or reduce certain capital expenses 
the outsourcing segment offers the client an array of services  functions and economic elements that can be tailored to the specific client program agenda  including business process management  it management  it planning and budgeting  applications support  applications implementation  it operations  data center consolidation in our world class processing center  network monitoring and help desk in our network control center  financial management and risk sharing  facility management  application unification  application outsourcing and interim management 
the consulting segment provides information technology  as well as strategic and operations management consulting and solutions  and application support to a broad cross section of healthcare industry participants and information systems vendors 
the consulting segment also provides the tools  strategies and solutions necessary to improve patient safety  enhance financial performance  and ensure secure and private hipaa compliant transactions 
in recent years  we have expanded our outsourcing and solution sales capabilities 
as healthcare and other sectors implement web based technologies and applications  we may incur risks related to participation in such opportunities  markets and quickly evolving lines of business 
such risks can include  but are not limited to new and unforeseen technologies superseding development of web based applications and or the systems integration platforms and other technologies in which we have invested  increased competition in the outsourcing business from larger and better capitalized competitors who may also enjoy better name recognition and other competitive advantages  failure by us to develop and offer new services and solutions demanded by the market  failure of our services and solutions to generate sufficient demand in the market  potential government regulation of the internet  slowness of traditional healthcare clients to adopt new technologies  and increased competition for consultant talent  increasing our cost of providing services 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees for professional services 
we establish standard billing guidelines based on the type and level of service offered 
actual billing rates are established on a project by project basis and may vary from the standard guidelines 
billings for time and materials engagements are generally contracted to be made on a bi weekly basis to monitor client satisfaction and manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
revenue on time and materials contracts is recognized as the services are provided 
outsourcing contracts  fixed fee projects and pre packaged solution sales are billed by deliverable or on a periodic basis  typically monthly 
revenue on these contracts is generally recognized ratably over the life of the contract or based on progress toward project milestones 
as of december   we have six significant contracts to provide healthcare it outsourcing services 
in addition  we provide help desk and call center support  which are typically billable on a per seat per month basis  and managed trust digital security services  which are generally billed annually and recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
we also derive revenue from fees generated from our digital business transformationtm partnerships 
this revenue is generally recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve profit margins on existing and new contracts  which are consistent with our historical levels of profitability 
in addition  profit margins on outsourcing and support contracts are generally lower than other traditional consulting engagements 
on occasion  we may collect payment prior to providing services 
these payments are recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
increased use of fixed fee contracts subjects us to increased risks  including cost overruns 
moreover  we incur significant expense in the process of seeking  developing and negotiating large fixed fee contracts  such as outsourcing contracts 
in addition  the implementation of certain outsourcing contracts requires significant initial investment by us in the hiring of personnel and the acquisition of equipment to perform the contract 
such expenses must be recovered over the life of the agreement 
some of our agreements call for penalties  or allow for early termination in the event we fail to meet certain service levels 
if we fail to meet required performance standards in our outsourcing  or other engagements  we could incur contractual penalties  or the agreements could terminate before we are able to recover the investments we made in the pursuit and initiation of the engagement 
in either event  we could suffer adverse financial consequences  as well as damage to our reputation in the industry  which could adversely and materially affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and the price of our common stock 
we seek to increase revenue through various means  including an increased emphasis on outsourcing contracts  an increase in the value and duration of projects for existing and new clients  as well as continued additions to our recurring revenue base 
in addition  we seek to increase revenue by expanding our range of specialty services with a focus on opportunities arising from the demand for clinical quality and patient safety  financial improvement  digital communications  system security and privacy expertise 
we manage our client development efforts through our internal client partner organizations cpo having specific geographic responsibility and focus 
within a geography  our cpo members develop relationships and pursue opportunities with strategic clients  maintain relationships with various stakeholders buyers  suppliers and advisors and develop other business opportunities 
our success in increasing our revenue will be dependent upon  among other factors  the recovery of the marketplace  timely sales  the type  range and quality of our services and solutions  competitive prices  growth and improvement in proposal acceptance rates in outsourcing and consulting  and successful competition in the marketplace 
many of the entities with whom we compete have greater financial resources  larger customer bases and greater technical and sales and marketing resources  which may impact our ability to compete against them successfully 
in addition  our revenues have and can be impacted by unforeseen disruptions in transportation  communications or other infrastructure components 
we have experienced weaker than anticipated revenue in recent quarters  particularly in the consulting segment 
this trend could continue if fiscal conservatism in healthcare organizations leads to continued unpredictability in the market for consulting services 
should we be unsuccessful in increasing or sustaining our revenue  for these or for other reasons  we may fail to meet the public market s expectations of our financial performance and operating results  which could have a material adverse effect on our common stock price 
our most significant expense is cost of services  which consists primarily of consultant compensation expense and operating costs associated with our full outsourcing contracts 
historically  consultant compensation expense has grown faster than consultant billing rates  resulting in an increase in our cost of services as a percentage of revenue 
we have sought to address the consultant compensation issue by adding an additional variable portion of compensation payable upon the achievement of measurable performance goals 
in addition  we have sought to address compensation expense pressures through increased use of stock options as an overall part of our compensation package 
these efforts have been hampered in the past by the impact of our stock price and could be affected in the future depending upon market conditions 
the market in which we compete for our talented and highly skilled consultant work force is highly competitive 
many of the entities with whom we compete for employees have greater financial and other resources than us  and may be able to offer more attractive compensation packages to candidates than we can  including salary  benefits  stock and stock options 
our ability to successfully operate our business and compete in our market is dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain skilled and motivated sales  management  administrative and technical personnel 
if we are unable to recruit and retain consultants to perform new and existing client engagements  our reputation in the industry and our ability to generate revenue will both suffer  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and on the price of our common stock 
moreover  our consultants are often key to our client relationships 
loss of key consultants could impair client relationships and adversely affect our ability to gain recurring engagements  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
our operating costs associated with the full outsourcing contracts have and will continue to increase as additional clients are serviced 
additionally  as we continue to migrate additional clients to the processing center  we expect to incur incremental normative costs  which will be offset with savings over time as additional clients are added and we are able to leverage our investment 
these costs consist primarily of  but are not limited to equipment lease costs  depreciation  telecommunication and facility related expenditures 
we expect to recover our investment in our processing and network management centers through the performance of multiple outsourcing contracts and network management netlinc contracts utilizing processing center resources 
if we are unsuccessful in winning sufficient new outsourcing and netlinc contracts  or if the terms of outsourcing or netlinc contracts are not sufficiently favorable to us  or if any of the existing outsourcing or netlinc contracts were to be terminated early for any reason  our ability to recover our processing center investments would be impaired  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  we will be performing data processing and other client information systems functions through our processing centers  which are critical to the clients operations 
any failure by us to successfully perform our processing center functions could adversely affect our clients operations  which could result in contractual performance penalties to us  early termination of one or more contracts  potential legal liabilities and damage to our reputation in the industry  any or all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and the price of our common stock 
our cost of services as a percentage of revenue is primarily driven by how efficiently we utilize our consultant resources and deliver our consulting and outsourcing services and solutions 
we attempt to optimize efficient deployment of our consultants through initial engagement planning and by continuously monitoring project requirements  timetables  and service and solution deliveries 
the number of consultants assigned to a project will vary according to the type  size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
project terminations  completions and scheduling delays  and incremental costs associated with the full outsourcing contracts have and can continue to cause us to experience lower gross margins 
in recent years the healthcare industry has experienced a slow down in consulting expenditures as fiscal constraints imposed by federal  state and commercial private payers  and lingering yk transition effects combined forces to dampen overall industry demand for new it service consulting projects 
these forces continued to hamper demand for our services in furthermore  changes in federal  state and commercial private payer reimbursement may continue to adversely affect the financial stability and viability of our clients and may impact their ability to contract for and pay for professional services such as those offered by us 
we record a provision for estimated uncollectible amounts based on prior collection experience 
during  the events of september and resulting disruptions in air travel adversely affected our business 
in addition  the aftermath of september  including increased federal spending on defense and homeland security  could adversely affect the federal and state governments spending on medicare  medicaid and other healthcare initiatives as well as state budget deficits and increased defense spending in connection with us war activities which could adversely affect our clients revenues and cause them to defer or cancel projects that would create demand for our services 
in addition  our consultants often perform services at the client s site  away from their own city or state of residence 
we are therefore  highly dependent upon effective air travel for the performance of a majority of our client engagements 
if  as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  current armed hostilities in the middle east and other unsettling world events  air travel becomes increasingly costly  time consuming  limited or unreliable  or should our employees become reluctant to travel  it could harm our ability to timely and cost effectively perform our client engagements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our establishment of new services and market offerings and hiring of consultants in peak hiring periods have and can from time to time adversely affect margins 
also  seasonal factors  such as vacation days  holidays and total business days in a quarter have and can affect margins 
variations in services and market offering solution sales  longer outsourcing sales cycles  uneven deployment of resources and failure to secure large engagements can also result in quarterly variability of our cost of services as a percentage of revenue 
our consultants are generally employed on a full time basis and therefore we will  in the short run  incur substantially all of our employee related costs even during periods of low utilization  as the majority of employment costs of these personnel are fixed 
in addition  we have and may from time to time discontinue service offerings that have not been successful in the market 
exiting a service offering can result in lower margins  as there may not be immediate opportunities for the reassignment of personnel  or there may be costs associated with the separation of personnel from us 
in addition  as we have responded to the diminishing demand for certain of our consulting services by contracting operations and reducing costs  we have and may again incur costs associated with business contractions  and may also lose the ability to recover investments made in personnel  equipment  office space and other assets associated with the service lines that are reduced or eliminated 
in the event that office space is closed by us  there can be no assurance that we will be able to sublease that space  or that sublease rents will offset our obligations under our prime lease s 
in addition  there can be no assurance that existing sublessees under our leases will not default in their rent or other obligations 
default by our sublessees  or an inability by us to sublease excess office space could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of recruiting  training and re training  continuing education  technology  sales and marketing  facilities  administration  outside professional fees and depreciation 
prior to  selling  general and administrative expenses also included amortization of goodwill 
however  on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which specifies that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization  but is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually 
during the three months ended december   we completed our annual assessment 
based on our findings  we concluded that goodwill was fully impaired  and recorded approximately million of impairment losses 
in connection with our continuing efforts to reduce our cost structure  we incurred restructuring charges of approximately million during the year ended december  these charges primarily related to the termination of a business alliance  which included the accelerated expense associated with a certain lease obligation and the write off of leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs 
also included in the restructuring charges are severance costs related to our continued organizational restructuring and the write off of property and equipment  partially offset by a reduction to the accrual for restructuring costs as of december  as a result of our restructuring plan and cost savings initiatives  we have reduced operating expenses  excluding impairment and restructuring charges  to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment of assets includes the difference between the carrying value and fair value of non essential real estate that we decided to sell during the quarter ended december   in order to reduce operating costs and improve liquidity 
we listed the real estate  an office building and undeveloped land adjacent to the building  with an agent during the fourth quarter of  and sold the real estate in february the fair value of the real estate was determined based on the ultimate sale price less costs to sell 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued staff announcement topic no 
d  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  which states that reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses should be characterized as revenue in the income statement 
the application of staff announcement topic no 
d does not have an impact on current or previously reported net earnings loss or earnings loss per share 
we will continue to use net revenue revenue before out of pocket reimbursements and net cost of services cost of services before out of pocket reimbursements to compute percentage and margin calculations  as well as for purposes of comparing the results of operations for the year ended december   to the year ended december   and the year ended december  to the year ended december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our estimates are based on prior experience  current business and market conditions  as well as various other assumptions we believe are necessary to form a basis for making judgments related to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
significant judgments  assumptions and estimates made by management include  but are not limited to the allowance for doubtful accounts  goodwill and intangible asset impairment and restructuring charges 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
refer to our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december   and included herein  for information regarding our significant accounting policies 
accounts receivable valuation 
virtually all of our accounts receivable are due from companies in the healthcare industry 
credit is extended based on evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are due within days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determined our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to us  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible  and payments subsequently received on such receivables are credited to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we typically do not assess interest on past due accounts 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment 
we are subject to a goodwill impairment assessment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas during the three months ended december   we completed our annual impairment assessment 
we estimated fair value using market capitalization  the expected present value of future cash flows and other available information 
based on our findings  we concluded that goodwill was fully impaired  and recorded impairment losses of approximately million 
restructuring charges 
we accrue for restructuring charges when we are specifically able to identify actions that need to be taken in response to a change in our strategic plan  product demand  increased costs or other business factors 
we routinely evaluate the prior restructuring accruals and make any necessary adjustments to reflect any changes in the costs of the restructuring activities 
during the year ended december   we recorded a reduction to the accrual for future lease obligations  as the result of subletting office space during  which was previously included in the accrual 
we also recorded an additional accrual for future lease obligations for office space we vacated during and were unable to sublet 
estimates are based on anticipated costs to exit such activities and are subject to change based on our actual ability to sublet 
as of december   the restructuring related accrual amounted to approximately million  which represents the present value of future operating lease obligations for facilities no longer used by us  but not sublet or sublet at amounts less than our obligation  as well as severance costs related to our continued organizational restructuring 
our restructuring accrual may be adjusted in the future  based on our actual success in subleasing compared to our estimate 
our key accounting estimates and policies are reviewed with our auditors and the audit committee of our board of directors

the decrease is primarily attributable to increased operating efficiencies as a result of our cost cutting measures 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges were million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the majority of the charges associated with the implementation of the restructuring plan during the year ended december   being recorded during the third and fourth quarter of restructuring charges recorded during the year ended december   consisted primarily of costs incurred as a result of the acceleration of lease costs associated with office space we determined was no longer necessary in our current business model and had been unable to sublet as of december  the restructuring charges also consisted of the write off of property and equipment associated with closed office facilities  the write off of leasehold improvements related to closed or sublet office space and severance costs related to our continued organizational restructuring  partially offset by a reduction to the accrual for restructuring costs included in accrued liabilities as of december  restructuring charges recorded during the year ended december   consisted primarily of severance costs related to the reduction in workforce  the write off of property and equipment and the closing of various office facilities 
refer to note restructurings of our consolidated financial statements included herein  for further details on the components of the restructuring charges 
other income and expense 
other expense was million for the year ended december   as compared to other income of million for the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of the million loss recognized on the sale of investment securities during the year ended december   compared to the million net gain recognized on the sale of investment securities during the year ended december  we received proceeds of  from the sale of our remaining  shares of neoforma  inc common stock in liquidity and capital resources in connection with the restructuring plan initiated during  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million during the year ended december  these charges primarily related to the accelerated expense associated with certain lease obligations  the write off of property and equipment and leasehold improvements  and severance costs related to our continued organizational restructuring  partially offset by a reduction to the accrual for restructuring costs 
during the year ended december   we recorded additional restructuring charges of approximately million  which consisted primarily of costs associated with the termination of a business alliance  which included the accelerated expense associated with a certain lease obligation and the write off of leasehold improvements and capitalized software development costs 
the restructuring charges also included severance costs related to our continued organizational restructuring and the write off of property and equipment  partially offset by a reduction to the accrual for restructuring costs 
refer to note restructurings of our consolidated financial statements included herein  for further details on the components of the restructuring charges 
during the year ended december   we had cash outflows associated with these restructuring charges of approximately  of which approximately  related to the accelerated expense associated with certain lease obligations  which was accrued for as of december  and approximately  related to severance costs  which was included in additional charges recorded during the current accrued liability for additional cash outflows  related to severance costs and the accelerated expense associated with certain lease obligations  is approximately million and will be payable as follows  during   during   during   during and  during our primary capital needs have been  and will be  to fund our outsourcing and solution sales initiatives  as well as our capital expenditures 
we believe after giving effect to the restructuring plan  and assuming appropriate cost control initiatives and revenue consistent with recent levels  that our current cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  plus available credit under our current and or anticipated credit agreements with our lenders  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the nature  amount and timing of our long term capital needs can be affected by a number of factors 
for example  our strategic plan includes a heightened focus on the development of our outsourcing business and the winning of large contracts 
implementation of a new outsourcing contract has and can involve the need for capital investment by us  including the hiring of new personnel and the acquisition of a client s it assets  including hardware and software 
an additional element of our outsourcing business strategy includes offering data center consolidation to our clients  which has and will continue to require investment by us in data or processing center facilities 
the timing  number and scale of potential future outsourcing contracts can impact our need for capital resources 
in addition  our future long term capital needs will be affected by the nature and timing of our market and service offerings  in addition to outsourcing  and the degree and timing of success enjoyed by such offerings in the market 
a failure of our offerings to meet success in the market  and our inability to adjust our operating expenses to an appropriate level commensurate with operating revenues  can also affect our need for capital resources 
for all of these reasons and those identified in the other risk factors discussed herein  our ability to project long term revenue levels and capital needs is subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our available funds and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements  and if we do not obtain the expected credit agreements  or if an event of default occurs under our current and or anticipated credit agreements with our lenders and we are required to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreements  we may need to seek additional sources of funding  such as selling additional equity or debt securities or obtaining additional lines of credit 
we could also  in such event  face the need to delay or reduce the development of services or the pursuit of contracts that would require significant investment to complete 
we could also face the need to reduce staffing levels and related expenses or potentially to liquidate or mortgage selected assets 
if the company decides that it is in our best interest to raise cash to strengthen our balance sheet  broaden our investor base  increase liquidity of our pool of publicly traded stock or for any other reason  we may decide to issue equity or debt  notwithstanding that our currently available funds are sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
we may decide to enter into such a transaction to raise cash even if all of our current funding sources remain available to us 
if we issue additional securities to raise funds  those securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of our common stock and our shareholders may experience dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
our inability to obtain additional financing when needed could impair our ability to develop products and services for the market  to enter into or implement new outsourcing contracts  to implement our business strategies  and may otherwise materially and adversely affect our financial condition 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  as compared with cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million at december  as of december   we have a line of credit arrangement at comerica bank na allowing for borrowings of up to million  based on qualifying accounts receivable 
based on the eligibility provisions in the loan agreement  we could have borrowed million on the line of credit as of december   million was outstanding 
borrowings under the line mature in april borrowings bear interest at the greater of the prime rate or plus the federal funds effective rate 
the interest rate at december  was 
the line is collateralized by accounts receivable and any deposits held by the bank 
we did not meet certain financial operating covenants as of december   and have repaid the outstanding balance 
we are currently negotiating a new line of credit 
in addition  we have letters of credit of approximately million issued by a bank  secured by bank deposits 
our net cash provided by operations increased to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december net cash of million used in investing activities during the year ended december   consists of additions to property  equipment and software  which primarily relate to the new full outsourcing contracts 
net cash of  provided by financing activities during the year ended december   was the result of the exercises of stock options and principal payments received for stockholders notes receivables  partially offset by payments on our capital lease obligations 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of our operations

the timing of revenues varies from quarter to quarter because our sales cycle can be relatively long and may depend on factors such as the size and scope of assignments  the general ability of clients to terminate engagements without penalty  long outsourcing sales cycles and general economic conditions 
in addition  the timing of the establishment of new competency centers  services and market offerings  geographic expansion and the hiring of key individuals have and can adversely affect margins 
seasonal factors such as vacation days  total business days in a quarter or the business practices of clients  such as deferred commitments on new projects until after the end of the calendar or the client s fiscal year  have and can affect margins 
because a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed  a variation in the number or size of client assignments or the timing of the initiation or the completion of client assignments can cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result of the factors above  and others  period to period comparison of our revenue and operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of future performance as no assurances can be given that quarterly results will not fluctuate  causing a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial conditions
