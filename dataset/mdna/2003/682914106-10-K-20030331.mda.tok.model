item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview onyx is a specialized consumer finance company engaged in the purchase  origination  securitization and servicing of contracts originated by franchised and select independent automobile dealerships in the united states 
the company focuses its efforts on acquiring contracts that are collateralized by late model used and  to a lesser extent  new automobiles  that are entered into with purchasers whom the company believes have a favorable credit profile 
since commencing the purchase of contracts in february  the company has acquired more than billion in contracts and currently has relationships with approximately  dealerships 
the company has expanded its operations from a single office in california to auto finance centers serving many regions of the united states 
the company generates revenues primarily through the purchase  origination  warehousing  subsequent securitization and ongoing servicing of contracts 
the company earns net interest income on contracts held during the warehousing period 
upon the securitization and sale of contracts  the company recognizes a gain on sale of contracts  receives future excess cash flows generated by securitization trusts  and earns fees from servicing the securitized contracts 

table of contents the following table illustrates the changes in the company s contract acquisition volume  total revenue  securitization activity and serviced portfolio during the past three fiscal years 
selected financial information for the years ended december  dollars in thousands contracts purchased during year average monthly purchases during the year net interest income gain on sale of contracts impairment residual securitization sale service fee income total revenue contracts securitized during the year serviced portfolio at year end total revenue is comprised of net interest income  service fee income and gain on sale of contracts 
contracts purchased and serviced portfolio in an effort to improve borrower credit statistics  the company modified its incentive compensation system during the fourth quarter of to shift its purchases of contracts to a higher percentage of higher credit quality product 
the result has been increased credit scores  slower volume growth and an improvement in overall borrower statistics 
this improvement continued throughout the reduction in growth also reflects the softening of the economy and  to a lesser extent  the events of september th and zero percent financing incentives offered by most of the automobile manufacturers 
the reduction in contract purchases  since the modification of the company s compensation system  has resulted in a lower growth rate of the company s serviced portfolio 
the serviced portfolio at december   was billion compared to billion at december   an increase of 
this rate of growth declined to for and percent for  as the serviced portfolio remained at approximately billion for both december  and with contract purchases stable  management has continued to focus its efforts on reviewing and utilizing automation tools to assist in the underwriting and credit review processes 
the resulting enhancements to the front end credit decision processes are expected to improve the speed of the decision and the amount of information available to the credit officers 
management has also enhanced the post funding review process of the underwriting decision so that the process is more automated and can be customized to select and analyze contracts meeting specific criteria 
critical accounting policies credit enhancement assets sfas requires that following a transfer of financial assets  an entity is to recognize the assets it controls and the liabilities it has incurred  and derecognize assets for which control has been surrendered and liabilities that have been extinguished 

table of contents credit enhancement assets consisted of the following december  in thousands trust receivables risa total trust receivables represent initial deposits in spread accounts 
retained interest in securitized assets risa capitalized upon securitization of contracts  represents the present value of the estimated future earnings to be received by the company from the excess spread created in securitization transactions 
excess spread is calculated by taking the difference between the weighted average coupon rate of the contracts sold and the weighted average security rate paid to the investors less contractually specified servicing and guarantor fees and projected credit losses  after giving effect to estimated prepayments 
prepayment and credit loss assumptions are utilized to project future earnings and are based on historical experience 
the company uses a prepayment rate for all outstanding securitizations with an average contract life range of to years 
credit loss assumptions range from to cumulative depending upon the credit statistics of the underlying portfolio to be securitized 
credit losses are estimated using cumulative loss frequency and severity estimates by management 
all assumptions are evaluated each quarter and adjusted  if appropriate  to reflect the actual performance of the underlying contracts 
future earnings are discounted at a rate management believes to be representative of market at the time of securitization  which during ranged from to 
as of december   the discount rates used for valuing risa ranged from to  and loss assumptions ranged from to cumulative 
changes in loss  prepayment and discount rate assumptions applied upon the execution of the securitization could have a material effect on the original gain recorded 
the company has disclosed under note to its audited financial statements  a sensitivity analysis of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate and adverse changes in those assumptions 
during  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
eitf establishes new income and impairment recognition standards for interests in certain securitized assets 
under the provisions of eitf  the holder of beneficial interests should recognize the excess of all estimated cash flows attributable to the beneficial interest estimated at the acquisition date over the initial investment the accretable yield as interest income over the life of the beneficial interest using the effective yield method 
if the estimated cash flows change  then the holder of the beneficial interest should recalculate the accretable yield and adjust the periodic accretion recognized as income prospectively 
if the fair value of a beneficial interest has declined below its carrying amount  an other than temporary decline is considered to exist if there has been a decline in estimated future cash flows and the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the beneficial interest is recorded as an impairment loss through the income statement 
the company computes a gain on sale with respect to contracts securitized based on the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received from such contracts using a market discount rate 
gain on sale is recorded as a credit enhancement asset on the statement of financial condition 
the gain recorded in the statement of income is adjusted for prepaid dealer participation  issuance costs  the gain or loss on the termination of the cash flow hedge and impairment charges 
the gain on the sale of contracts is affected by the amount of contracts securitized and the net interest rate spread on those contracts 
during the year ended  the company recorded an impairment loss of million  compared to million for the year ended december  the impairments principally reflect the adverse performance of six securitizations executed during and  stemming from higher than expected losses and delinquency on such securitizations 

table of contents effective april   the company adopted eitf prior to the adoption of eitf  the balance of risa was amortized against actual excess spread income earned on a monthly basis over the expected repayment life of the underlying contracts 
the adoption of eitf resulted in amounts previously recognized as service fee income being recognized as interest income 
results of operations years ended december   and the company had net income of million for the year ended december   compared to net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in net income for the year was principally due to a reduction in gains realized on securitizations to million in from million and million in and respectively 
while the company has experienced a significant reduction in its overall delinquency rates since december   certain pre securitizations experienced higher losses and delinquency rates than initially projected at the inception of the transactions  as a result of the slow down in the economy and the lower credit quality of the borrowers 
the impairment charges have been recorded to reduce the gain on sale recorded for the year 
total impairment charges were million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
the decrease in gain recorded for the year ended december  was partially offset by an increase in net interest income as discussed below 
net interest income 
net interest income consists primarily of the difference between the finance revenue earned on contracts held on balance sheet during the warehousing period and the interest costs associated with the company s borrowings to purchase such contracts  and the difference between income accreted on risa and the interest costs associated with residual line borrowings secured by risa 
net interest income increased to million for  from million during  and million during the increases were principally due to an increase in interest income generated from the company s risa and a decrease in interest expense on the company s commercial paper line 
the increase in net interest income was also due to an increase in yields realized under the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf  which requires amounts previously recognized as excess service fee income to be recognized as interest income 
for the year ended december  total income recognized under eitf was approximately million  versus approximately million for the same period in the effective yield recognized under the provisions of eitf during was  compared to in the increase in yield for was principally due to lower credit losses and better overall performance on the company s and securitizations versus its original projections made at the time of sale 
there was no eitf income recognized prior to the second quarter of  as the provisions did not become effective until april  interest expense associated with borrowings under residual lines secured by risa totaled approximately million for the year  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to interest expenses associated with the issuance of the million residual securitization executed in march of the company classifies this interest expense as a component of net interest income to better match risa revenues with risa secured expenses 
previous to eitf  the company classified interest expense associated with its residual lines under other interest expense  not as a component of net interest income 
total commercial paper interest expense for the year was million  compared to million and million for the same periods in and respectively 
the weighted average interest rate paid on the company s commercial paper line for the year was approximately  compared to and for and  respectively 
finance revenue earned on contracts held for sale and investment was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the table below depicts the major components of net interest income

contractual servicing fee income is earned at a rate of per annum on the outstanding principal balance of contracts securitized 
servicing fee income is related to the size of the serviced portfolio and also includes investment interest  late fees  extension fees  document fees and other fees charged to customer accounts 
servicing fee income was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
the reduction in service fee income was principally due to a reduction in investment income received on trust cash accounts during the current periods reported 
additionally  included in the first three months of  was approximately million of excess service fee income recorded prior to the adoption of eitf for the year ended december   excess service fee income was approximately million 
gain on sale of contracts 
the company computes a gain on sale with respect to contracts securitized based on the present value of the estimated future excess cash flows to be received from such contracts using a market discount rate 
gain on sale is recorded as a credit enhancement asset on the statement of financial condition 
the gain recorded in the statement of income is adjusted for prepaid dealer participation  issuance costs  the gain or loss on the termination of the cash flow hedge and impairment charges 
the gain on the sale of contracts is affected by the amount of contracts securitized and the net interest rate spread on those contracts

the impairment charges have been 
table of contents recorded to reduce the gain on sale recorded during the period 
the table below depicts the components of the net gain as reported in the consolidated statements of income 
for the years ended december  dollars in thousands gain on sale impairment residual securitization sale total net gain on sale of contracts the reduction in the gain as a percentage of the contracts securitized for was attributable to a decrease in net interest rate spreads 
over the past two years  management has targeted higher credit worthy borrowers resulting in a reduction in the weighted average net interest spread for securitizations executed 
the weighted average net interest rate spread for all securitizations executed in was  compared to in and in the reduction in net interest rate spread for and was principally due to a reduction in the weighted average annual percentage rate in the contracts securitized 
in an effort to improve borrower credit statistics  the company modified its incentive compensation system during the fourth quarter of to shift purchases of contracts to a higher percentage of higher credit quality products 
the result has been increased credit scores and an improvement in overall borrower statistics 
this improvement continued throughout the allowance for loan loss on the serviced portfolio has declined as a percentage of loans outstanding as newer transactions have lower loss reserves based on the improved quality of the underlying contracts 
delinquency has declined due in part to the contracts originated in and the majority of the charge offs relate to older transactions that have been impacted by the slow down in the economy and  to a lesser extent  the softening of the used car market  which resulted in lower recovery rates on repossessions 
the net interest rate spread is the difference between the weighted average contract rate of the securitized assets  and the weighted average investor rate inclusive of all costs related to the transaction 
interest rate spread is affected by product mix  general market conditions and overall market interest rates 
the risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations are partially reduced through hedging activities 
during the first quarter of  the company securitized the residual cash flows from of its then outstanding securitizations and recorded a loss of approximately  which approximated the costs in connection with the transaction 
the proceeds of this transaction were used to pay down two of the company s residual financing facilities and pay off another residual financing facility 
the company refinanced this residual securitization during the second and fourth quarters of during the first quarter of  the company completed its second residual securitization from the residual cash flows of nine outstanding securitizations 
the company did not record a gain on the transaction  as it was structured as a financing transaction rather than a sale 
the transaction was rated by moody s investors service  inc as ba  with proceeds of approximately million 
a spread account equal to one year s interest was structured into the transaction 
the proceeds of the residual securitization were used to pay down the company s residual lines with affiliates of its securitization underwriters 
the company plans to continue to integrate residual securitizations in its business plan as a source of liquidity 
provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses represents net credit losses incurred on contracts held for investment 
the provision for credit losses decreased to thousand for the year ended december  compared to million and million for and respectively 
the provision for credit losses for the year ended december  reflects a sales tax refund of approximately million 
the refund has been treated as a recovery as it relates to pro rata sales taxes paid by the company in financing the purchases of vehicles for which the related contracts have been previously charged off 
the company plans to pursue additional refunds from applicable states in the forthcoming quarters 

table of contents changes in the allowance for credit losses were as follows december  in thousands balance at beginning of period provision for credit losses charged off loans recoveries tax refund recoveries general balance at end of period other interest expense 
other interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
other interest expense includes interest and amortized fees on the company s subordinated debt  capital lease obligations and the costs associated with hedging activities under the guidelines of fas prior to the second quarter of  the company also included interest from its residual lines of credit as a component of other interest expense 
for the year ended december  and  interest under the residual lines classified as other interest expense was million and million  respectively 
for the last three quarters of and all of  the company has classified interest expense from its residual lines of credit under net interest income as a means to match income generated under the provisions of eitf the increase in interest expense for the year ended december  were due to interest recorded in connection with fas and interest charges in connection with the company s renewable notes program launched during the first quarter of the weighted average interest rate on the balance of the renewable notes outstanding as of december  was 
the renewable notes have varying maturities ranging from three months to years 
charges related to the guidelines of fas were million compared to million for the same period in the increases were principally due to increases in the ineffective portion of the unrealized loss on cash flow hedges due to more rapid interest rate declines throughout versus and the change in value of the forward premium between the swap execution date and the financial reporting date

as of december   the company serviced approximately  accounts  compared to approximately  accounts at year end and  accounts at year end in addition to the system cost savings of the in house loan servicing and collection system  the company also experienced reductions in systems and servicing expense as a direct result of renegotiated contracts with several of the company s other service providers 
telephone and data line expenses 
telephone and data line expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
although these charges generally increase with the growth of the serviced portfolio  the significant decrease between and the two prior years was principally due to renegotiated contracts for long distance rates with certain carriers and  to a lesser extent  a re evaluation of the company s existing uses of local carriers and an increase in the credit quality of the serviced portfolio when compared to and assuming no additional reduction in long distance rates  the company expects these charges to increase relative to the growth of the serviced portfolio

contracts held for investment contracts held for investment are net of a million allowance for probable losses as of december  and a million allowance as of december  amounts held for investment include contracts that do not qualify for contract securitizations as a result of delinquency status or minimum balance 
the company maintains an allowance for credit losses to cover anticipated losses on the contracts held for investment on the statement of financial condition 
the allowance for credit losses is increased by charging the provision for credit losses and decreased by actual losses on the contracts held for investment 
the level of the allowance is based principally on the outstanding balance of contracts held for investment and historical loss trends 
credit enhancement assets credit enhancement assets consisted of the following as of december  dollars in thousands trust receivables risa total trust receivables represents initial deposits in spread accounts 
retained interest in securitized assets risa capitalized upon securitization of contracts represent the present value of the estimated future earnings to be received by the company from the excess spread created in securitization transactions

prepayment and credit loss assumptions are utilized to project future earnings and are based on historical experience 
credit losses are estimated using cumulative loss frequency and severity estimates by management 
all assumptions are evaluated each quarter and adjusted  if appropriate  to reflect the actual performance of the underlying contracts 
future earnings are discounted at a rate management believes to be representative of market at the time of securitization

the allowance is based upon historical experience and management s estimate of other factors that may affect portfolio performance 
the amount is reviewed periodically and adjustments are made if actual experience or other factors indicate that future performance may differ from management s prior estimates 
in an effort to improve borrower credit statistics  the company modified its incentive compensation system during the fourth quarter of to shift purchases of contracts to a higher percentage of higher credit quality products 
the result has been increased credit scores and an improvement in overall borrower statistics 
this improvement continued throughout the allowance for loan loss on the serviced portfolio has declined as a percentage of loans outstanding as newer transactions have lower loss reserves based on the improved quality of the underlying contracts 
the off balance sheet allowance decreased to at december  compared to at december  and at december  the weighted average gross spread for securitizations executed during was compared to in and in estimated future undiscounted risa earnings are calculated over the contractual term of the securitization by taking the difference between the weighted average annual percentage rate of the contracts sold and the weighted average security rate paid to the investors  less the contractually specified servicing fee of  financial guaranty insurance premiums and other costs and fees  after giving effect to estimated prepayments and assuming no losses 
to arrive at the risa  this amount is reduced by the off balance sheet allowance established for probable future losses and by discounting the estimate of future risa cash flows to present value at the current estimated market discount rates

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company requires substantial cash and capital resources to operate its business 
its primary uses of cash include i acquisition of contracts  ii payments of dealer participation  iii securitization costs  iv settlements of hedging transactions  v operating expenses  and vi interest expense 
the capital resources available to the company include i interest income during the warehousing period  ii servicing fees  iii releases from spread accounts  iv settlements of hedging transactions  v sales of contracts in securitizations  and vi borrowings under its credit facilities

these facilities are then used to fund the purchase of contracts or to finance normal operating expenses 
the company has historically operated on a negative cash flow basis  excluding the effects of securitization transactions  from operating activities  but expects to generate positive cash flow on a monthly basis by year end  provided the volume of contract purchases remains steady on an annual basis 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used during the same period in the change in cash generated in operating activities for the year ended december  versus is due to several factors  including the relative size of the securitizations executed in comparison to the total volume of contracts originated  net yield credit triggers being hit on six of the company s pre securitizations  which restricted cash releases in from the corresponding spread accounts  and a second residual interest securitization during the first quarter of the combined effect of these activities increased cash from operating activities by approximately million  when compared to cash scheduled to be released from the spread accounts was retained as a means to reduce reinsurance balances prior to being released to the company

the company pledges certain of its contracts held for sale to borrow under the cdc cp facility 
the cdc cp facility expires in january but may be renewed by agreement of the parties 
in conjunction with the procurement of the new facility  the company elected to reduce its line with triple a one funding corporation and mbia to million 

table of contents the company finances dealer participation payments and daily operations principally through credit facilities collateralized by its retained interest in securitized assets  as well as through proceeds from subordinated debt offerings 
the residual lines the company  through onyx acceptance funding corporation fundco  currently has two residual financing facilities a million line with salomon smith barney realty corporation sbrc and a million facility with credit suisse first boston europe limited  as buyer csfb europe  and credit suisse first boston corporation  as agent csfb 
the sbrc facility together with the csfb europe facility are sometimes referred to herein as the residual lines 
the residual lines are used by the company to finance operating requirements 
the lines utilize collateral based formulas that set borrowing availability to a percentage of the value of excess cash flow to be received from certain securitizations 
each loan under the sbrc line matures one year after the date of the loan 
the csfb europe line was renewed in october for a one year term 
residual securitizatons as an additional source of funds  the company utilizes residual securitizations to pay down its residual financing facilities to increase the company s liquidity

the company was in compliance with these covenants as of december  hedging and interest rate risk management the company employs a hedging strategy that is intended to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
such transactions involve the execution of forward interest rate swaps and or the use of a pre funding structure for the company s securitizations 
the company is not required to maintain collateral on the outstanding hedging program until the point where the fair value declines below million 
securitizations off balance sheet arrangements are used in the ordinary course of business 
generally  these transactions are structured as off balance sheet sales of contracts 
one of the most common forms of off balance sheet arrangements is contract securitizations 
regular contract securitizations are an integral part of the company s business plan because they allow the company to increase its liquidity  provide for redeployment of its capital and reduce risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the company has developed a securitization program that involves selling interests in pools of its contracts to investors through the public issuance of aaa aaa rated asset backed securities 
automobile securitizations are used by many financial institutions and are part of a billion annual market for asset backed securities 
as part of this process  management considers the relative risks and returns prior to initiating each securitization 
these risks include  but are not limited to  interest rate fluctuations during the warehouse period  increased prepayments speeds and losses  loss of credit enhancement for the underlying securitization  loss of servicing rights and adverse economic conditions 
these factors are explained in further detail in the section risk factors 
the table below provides information about the trusts assets and liabilities as of december  and 
table of contents december  in thousands total assets total liabilities the company completed four aaa aaa rated publicly underwritten asset backed securitizations in the amount of billion in since  the company has securitized billion of its contracts in separate transactions 
in each of its securitizations  the company has sold its contracts to a newly formed grantor or owner trust  which issued certificates or notes in an amount equal to the aggregate principal balance of the contracts 
the net proceeds of these securitizations were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness incurred under the company s triple a cp facility to purchase contracts  thereby creating availability for the purchase of additional contracts 
to improve the level of profitability from the sale of securitized contracts  the company arranges for credit enhancement to achieve an improved credit rating on the asset backed securities issued 
this credit enhancement has taken the form of a financial guaranty insurance policy the financial guarantee insurance policy insuring the payment of principal and interest due on the asset backed securities 
the company receives servicing fees for its duties relating to the accounting for and collection of the contracts 
in addition  the company is entitled to the future excess cash flows arising from the trusts 
generally  the company sells the contracts at face value and without recourse  except that certain representations and warranties with respect to the contracts are provided by the company as the servicer and finco as the seller to the trusts 
gains on sale of contracts arising from securitizations provide a significant portion of the company s revenues 
several factors affect the company s ability to complete securitizations of its contracts  including conditions in the securities markets generally  conditions in the asset backed securities market specifically  the credit quality of the company s portfolio of contracts and the company s ability to obtain credit enhancement 
interest rate exposure and hedging the company is able through the use of varying maturities on advances from the cp facilities to lock in rates during the warehousing period  when in management s judgment it is appropriate to limit interest rate exposure during such warehousing period see risk factors interest rate risk 
the company has the ability to move rates upward in response to rising borrowing costs because the company currently does not originate loans near the maximum rates permitted by law 
further  the company employs a hedging strategy which primarily consists of the execution of forward interest rate swaps 
these hedges are entered into by the company in numbers and amounts which generally correspond to the anticipated principal amount of the related securitization 
gains and losses relative to these hedges are recognized in full at the time of securitization as an adjustment to the gain on sale of the contracts 
the company has only used counterparties with investment grade debt ratings from national rating agencies for its hedging transactions 
management monitors the company s hedging activities on a frequent basis to ensure that the value of hedges  their correlation to the contracts being hedged and the amounts being hedged continue to provide effective protection against interest rate risk 
the company s hedging strategy requires estimates by management of monthly contract acquisition volume and timing of its securitizations 
if such estimates are materially inaccurate  then the company s gain on sales of contracts and results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
the amount and timing of hedging transactions are determined by senior management based upon the amount of contracts purchased and the interest rate environment 
senior management currently expects to hedge substantially all of its contracts pending securitization

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of its dependence upon the issuance of interest bearing securities and the incurrence of debt to fund its lending activities 
several factors can influence the company s ability to manage interest rate risk 
first  contracts are purchased at fixed interest rates  while the amounts borrowed under the warehouse credit facilities bear interest at variable rates that are subject to frequent adjustment to reflect prevailing market interest rates 
second  the interest rate demanded by investors in a securitization is a function of prevailing market rates for comparable transactions and the general interest rate environment 
because the contracts originated by the company have fixed interest rates  the company bears the risk of smaller gross interest rate spreads in the event interest rates increase during the period between the date contracts are purchased and the completion and pricing of securitization transactions 
the company uses several strategies to minimize interest rate risk  including the utilization of derivative financial instruments  the regular securitization of contracts and the use of pre funding in securitization transactions 
pre funding securitizations is the practice of issuing more asset backed securities than the amount of contracts initially sold to the trust 
the proceeds from the pre funded portion are held in an escrow account until additional contracts are sold to the trust in amounts up to the balance of the pre funded escrow account 
in pre funded securitizations  investor interest rates are locked in with respect to the contracts subsequently delivered to the securitization trust 
however  the company incurs an expense in pre funded securitizations equal to the difference between the money market yields earned on the proceeds held in escrow prior to the subsequent delivery of contracts and the interest rate paid on the asset backed securities outstanding 
derivative financial instruments are utilized to manage the gross interest rate spread on the company s securitization transactions 
the company sells fixed rate contracts to the trusts that  in turn  sell fixed rate securities to investors 
the fixed rates on securities issued by the trusts are indexed to swap rates on

the company periodically executes the sale of forward swap agreements to lock in the indexed rate for specific anticipated securitization transactions 
the company utilizes these derivative financial instruments to modify its net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate based on the company s risk tolerance 
all transactions are entered into for purposes other than trading  and are settled quarterly upon pricing of the securitization 
the company remitted cash payments  net of expenses  of approximately million in  million in  and million in to settle forward interest rate swap agreements 
these amounts were included in the gain on sale of contracts in securitization transactions 
cash payments are recovered over time through a higher gross interest rate spread on the related securitization transaction  while cash receipts are offset through a lower gross interest rate spread on the related securitization transaction 
as of december   the company had million of forward interest rate swap agreements outstanding
