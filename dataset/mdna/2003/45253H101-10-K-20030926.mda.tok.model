item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since the company s inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of antibody based cancer therapeutics and novel treatments in the field of oncology 
the combination of our expertise in antibodies and cancer has resulted in the generation of both proprietary products and technologies 
our lead  proprietary  tumor activated prodrug  or tap  technology combines extremely potent  small molecule drugs with monoclonal antibodies that recognize and bind specifically to tumor cells 
our targeted delivery technology increases the potency of these cancer specific antibodies  which allow our drugs to kill cancer cells while avoiding harm to healthy tissue 
the cytotoxic agent we currently use in all of our tap products is the maytansinoid dm  a chemical derivative of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer to develop other types of therapeutics  such as naked antibody anticancer products 
we have entered into collaborative agreements that allow companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial products containing their antibodies 
we have also used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer products 
in july  we announced a discovery  development and commercialization collaboration with aventis pharmaceuticals  inc under the terms of the agreement  aventis gains commercialization rights to three of the most advanced products in our preclinical pipeline and the commercialization rights to certain new products developed during the research program portion of the collaboration 
this collaboration allows us to access aventis cancer targets and their clinical development and commercialization capabilities 
we also licensed certain rights to hun dm  an internally developed tap product candidate  to british biotech in order to access their clinical development capabilities 
the terms of our collaborative agreements vary  reflecting the value we add to the development of any particular product candidate  however  the agreements generally provide that we receive upfront and milestone payments  royalties on sales of any resulting products and reimbursement of our fully burdened cost to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials 
under the terms of the aventis agreement  we also are entitled to receive committed research funding of approximately million during the three year research program 
should aventis elect to exercise its contractual right to extend the term of the research program  we will receive additional research funding 
under certain agreements  we receive our fully burdened cost to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials plus a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include abgenix  inc  aventis  boehringer ingelheim international gmbh  british biotech plc  genentech  inc and millennium pharmaceuticals  inc we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 
in january  we announced that pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement between glaxosmithkline and ourselves  glaxosmithkline gave us written notice that it would relinquish all rights to develop and commercialize cantuzumab mertansine under their product license 
in february  we regained the development and commercialization rights to cantuzumab mertansine from glaxosmithkline  thereby terminating the product license 
we are now free to relicense the product as we consider most appropriate 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses over the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities 
in august  we received million from aventis  representing the non refundable upfront payment owed us upon the execution of our collaboration agreement 
we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaboration payments  including the million of committed research funding due us under the aventis agreement  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next five to seven fiscal years 
we do not anticipate that we will have a commercially approved product within the foreseeable future 
research and development expenses are expected to increase significantly in the near term as we continue our development efforts 
in the next six months  we expect to pay out approximately  to further expand our development and pilot manufacturing facility in norwood  massachusetts 
on july   we signed a sublease on approximately  square feet of laboratory and office space in a building located at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
we expect that we will spend approximately  over the next months to equip and occupy this additional space 
on august   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the open market repurchase of up to million shares of immunogen common stock 
the repurchases are to be made at the discretion of management and as market conditions warrant 
no time limit was set for the completion of the repurchase program 
as of june   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock at a total cost of million 
because repurchases are at management s discretion and subject to market conditions  we are unable to estimate the total cost of the repurchase program or the period during which such repurchases may take place 
we anticipate that the increase in total cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds including milestone payments and the committed research funding we will receive pursuant to the aventis collaboration 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also allowing for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we estimate the period of our significant involvement during development for each of our collaborative agreements 
we recognize any upfront fees received from our collaborators ratably over this estimated period of significant involvement 
we generally believe our period of significant involvement occurs between the date we sign a collaboration agreement and projected fda approval of our collaborators product that is the subject of the collaboration agreement 
we estimate that this time period is generally six years 
the actual period of our involvement could differ significantly based upon the results of our collaborators preclinical and clinical trials  competitive products that are introduced into the market and the general uncertainties surrounding drug development 
any difference between our estimated period of involvement during development and our actual period of involvement could have a material effect upon our results of operations 
in february  our full product license with glaxosmithkline terminated 
during the quarter ended march   we recognized  of revenue related to the glaxosmithkline upfront fee that remained in deferred revenue as of the termination date 
inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates and could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations in any reporting period 
we consider any dm or ansamitocin p raw material inventory in excess of months projected usage that is not supported by collaborators firm fixed orders to be excess 
we record any such raw material identified as excess at its net realizable value 
our estimate of months usage of dm and ansamitocin p raw material inventory is based upon our collaborators estimates of their future clinical material requirements 
our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and maximum tolerated dose of each clinical trial 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual months usage of dm and ansamitocin p varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
during the year ended june   we recorded as research and development expense million of amounts paid or payable to the manufacturers of ansamitocin p and dm to produce material that we have identified as excess based upon our inventory policy 
in april  one of our collaborators informed us that it may explore alternative sources of ansamitocin p and or dm in applying our inventory policy  we included this collaborator s months projected usage in the determination of our month supply of ansamitocin p and dm at june   we believe that approximately million of our ansamitocin p and or dm inventory will be used to produce conjugate for this collaborator 
if the collaborator finds and elects to use an alternative source of ansamitocin p and or dm  we will evaluate our inventory and  if necessary  will record an inventory valuation allowance to reduce to its net realizable value any ansamitocin p or dm inventory identified as excess 
we are unable to determine when  if ever  the collaborator would be able to secure an alternative source of ansamitocin p and or dm results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from to is primarily attributable to higher collaboration revenue 
on october   boehringer ingelheim confirmed to us that clinical trials of the novel anticancer agent  bivatuzumab mertansine  composed of our dm effector molecule and boehringer ingelheim s anti cdv antibody  had been initiated on or about september  the achievement of this milestone triggered a milestone payment of million from boehringer ingelheim to us 
on november   we announced that immunogen had earned a million milestone payment under its single target license agreement with millennium upon millennium s initiation of clinical trials with mln the increase in revenues from to is primarily attributable to increased revenues associated with preclinical and clinical materials we manufactured and delivered to our collaborative partners offset by lower collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue for the year ended june  increased to million compared to million in the same period in collaboration revenue for the year ended june  was million 
the increase in collaboration revenue from to is primarily attributable to milestones achieved under our single target license agreements with boehringer ingelheim and millennium pharmaceuticals  as discussed above 
in addition  during the year ended june   we recognized collaboration revenue of  from glaxosmithkline that represents the portion of the upfront payment glaxosmithkline had previously paid to immunogen that had not been recognized as revenue at the date of termination of the license agreement 
included in collaboration revenue in the year ended june  is a million milestone payment we received from glaxosmithkline upon the commencement of a phase i multidose clinical trial 
the revenue associated with this milestone was recognized on a percentage of completion basis over the period of our performance 
we substantially completed all of our performance during the year ended june  we did not earn any similar milestone payment during the year ended june  total collaboration revenue recognized from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table year ended june  collaborative partner glaxosmithkline    genentech    abgenix    millennium    boehringer ingelheim   total    deferred revenue of million at june  represents progress payments received from our collaborators pursuant to contract revenues not yet earned 
clinical materials reimbursement decreased to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials reimbursement of  during the year ended june  we first shipped clinical materials  for which we were entitled to reimbursement  in the quarter ended march  clinical materials reimbursement for the year ended june  reflects months of shipments compared to only five months of shipments in the year ended june  during the year ended june   we shipped clinical materials in support of the cantuzumab mertansine and hun dm clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practices cgmp at our pilot plant  in support of certain other collaborators development efforts 
during the year ended june   we shipped clinical materials in support of the hun dm  bivatuzumab mertansine  and mln clinical trials  as well as preclinical materials  in support of certain other collaborators development efforts 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed  is directly related to i the number of on going clinical trials for which we are producing clinical material for our collaborators  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from the clinical materials  and ii our production of clinical grade material on behalf of our collaborators  either in anticipation of clinical trials  or for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement and the related cost of clinical materials reimbursed may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and annually 
development fees decreased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  development fees were  in the year ended june  development fees represent the fully burdened reimbursement of costs incurred in producing research grade materials in accordance with good laboratory practices and developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
during the year ended june   we provided development services to more collaborators and potential collaborators than we had during the years ended june  and development fees decreased in compared to  primarily as a result of the advancement into clinical trials of bivatuzumab mertansine and mln  the products that are the subject of our collaborations with boehringer ingelheim and millennium  respectively 
the amount of development fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators products and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and annually 
research and development expenses we report research and development expense net of reimbursements we receive from our collaborators 
our net research and development expenses consist of i research to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies and cytotoxic drugs  ii preclinical testing and clinical trials of our own  and in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and iii development related to improving clinical and commercial manufacturing processes 
during the three fiscal years ended june   our research efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas our contributions to the clinical development of hun dm and cantuzumab mertansine  process improvements related to clinical and commercial production of the hun antibody  process improvements to our tap technology  preclinical development of our own potential products  process improvement related to the production of dm and strain development of its precursor  ansamitocin p  process development related to the commercial manufacture of the hun dm conjugate  operation  maintenance and expansion of our pilot scale manufacturing plant  identification and evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and in licensed antibodies  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents 
british biotech is currently conducting phase i and phase i ii clinical trials of hun dm british biotech is conducting the phase i ii study in the united states and the phase i clinical trial of hun dm in the united kingdom 
british biotech is the sponsor of these trials and  as such  has control over the clinical trial schedule and progress 
in july  british biotech announced its proposed acquisition of vernalis 
in late august the acquisition was declared unconditional in all respects after a significant majority of vernalis shareholders accepted british biotech s tender offer 
in connection with the acquisition  the merged company  which is proposed to be called vernalis  has announced that it intends to review its merged product candidate portfolio 
we anticipate that hun dm will be subject to review and we cannot  with any degree of certainty  predict the outcome of such review 
in addition to retaining commercial rights to hun dm worldwide  excluding the european union and japan  we retain worldwide manufacturing rights 
under the terms of the contract  we are responsible for all clinical and commercial manufacturing process development and certain antibody costs 
we are developing various processes related to the commercial manufacture of the hun dm conjugate 
under an arrangement with genzyme transgenics corporation  we investigated the viability of commercial production of hun antibody using transgenic goats 
worldwide antibody manufacturing capacity is currently constrained  and  generally  manufacturing capacity must be reserved months in advance of production 
we anticipate that we will incur substantial costs to meet our obligations under our agreement with british biotech to complete clinical and commercial conjugation process development efforts  reserve manufacturing space and manufacture humanized antibody 
we also expect that we will continue to devote significant human resources to the manufacturing process development efforts over the next five years 
in january  we announced that we would regain the development and commercialization rights to cantuzumab mertansine from glaxosmithkline  thereby terminating our collaborative agreement 
in february  glaxosmithkline terminated our license agreement and we are now free to relicense the product as we consider most appropriate 
we expect that the future cost  if any  to develop cantuzumab mertansine will be borne by a collaborative partner if we are successful in relicensing the product 
at present  we do not expect to incur significant additional costs related to the continued clinical development of cantuzumab mertansine 
as discussed above  we have licensed three of the most advanced product candidates in our preclinical pipeline to aventis under the terms of our discovery  development and commercialization collaboration 
those three product candidates are humy dm  an anti igf ir antibody and a third product 
humy dm is a humanized monoclonal antibody conjugated to dm and is directed against acute myeloid leukemia 
humy dm is in preclinical development 
at june  we continued to conduct preclinical safety and efficacy studies on humy dm pending the successful preclinical development of humy dm and favorable outcome of preclinical safety and efficacy studies and any other studies  we expected to be prepared to file an investigational new drug application ind for humy dm in the first half of calendar year however  the continued development of humy dm and the actual filing of this ind is now dependent upon aventis development and clinical strategy  as well as the results of any and all preclinical studies 
as a result  the timing of the filing of this ind  if it occurs at all  may vary from our original estimates 
anti igf ir antibody is a naked antibody directed against a target found on various solid tumors including certain breast  lung and prostate cancers 
at june   we continued to perform preclinical experiments to evaluate candidate antibodies and identified a lead antibody product candidate 
subject to aventis development and clinical strategy  pending the final results of the product candidate evaluations  we expect that one antibody will move into preclinical development in calendar year the third  undisclosed  potential product candidate is directed at certain b cell malignancies  including non hodgkin s lymphoma  and is in the early stages of preclinical development 
the cost to develop new products and advance those products to the ind stage can be significant 
under the terms of our discovery  development and research collaboration with aventis  they have licensed three of our most advanced preclinical product candidates 
with the exception of those antibodies or antibody targets that are the subject of our preexisting or future collaboration and license agreements  during the term of our collaborative research program  we are required to propose for inclusion in the collaborative research program  certain antibodies or antibody targets that we believe will have utility in oncology 
aventis then has the right to either include or exclude these proposed antibodies and antibody targets into the collaborative research program 
if aventis elects to exclude any antibodies or antibody targets  we may elect to develop the products 
furthermore  aventis may only include a certain number of antibody targets in the research program at any one time 
aventis must therefore exclude any proposed antibody or antibody target in excess of this number 
over the original  three year term of the research program  we will receive a minimum of million of committed research funding and will devote a significant amount of our internal research and development resources to advancing the research program 
under the terms of the agreement  we may advance any tap or antibody products that aventis has elected not to either initially include or advance in the research program 
at present  the potential product candidates in our pipeline that are not part of the aventis collaboration are in an early stage of discovery research and we are unable to accurately estimate which potential products  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop our potential products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery research stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the medical indications  the timing  size and dosing schedule of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
in many cases  we are unable to determine what  if any  indication a particular product candidate will treat until we have completed extensive preclinical studies 
given the uncertainties related to new drug development  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our research stage product candidates will generate revenues and cash flows 
dm is the cytotoxic agent that we currently use in the manufacture of all of our collaborators and our own conjugates 
in order to make commercial manufacture of dm conjugates viable  we have devoted substantial resources to improve the strain of the microorganism that produces ansamitocin p  the precursor to dm  to enhance manufacturing yields 
we also continue to devote considerable resources to improve other dm manufacturing processes 
we generally have not tracked our historical research and development costs by project  rather  we track such costs by department and expense category 
for this reason  we cannot accurately estimate with any degree of certainty what our historical costs have been for certain research and development projects 
we believe that our research and development costs by project are confidential and the disclosure of such costs could have a material negative effect on our ability to negotiate with our suppliers  collaborators and potential collaborators and  accordingly  do not disclose our individual project research and development expenses 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense for the year ended june  was million 
included in research and development expense for the year ended june  is million of antibody that we purchased in anticipation of potential future clinical trials and million of amounts paid or payable to the manufacturers of ansamitocin p and dm based upon current collaborator firm fixed orders and projections  we determined that our on hand supply of dm and its precursor ansamitocin p represented more than a month supply and is therefore considered excess under our inventory policy 
during the same period in  we recorded charges of million and  to reduce the value of cantuzumab mertansine inventory and hun prepaid assets and inventory  respectively  to their net realizable value 
during the year ended june   glaxosmithkline was conducting their second and third phase i clinical trials of cantuzumab mertansine 
glaxosmithkline reimbursed us the cost of clinical materials in the second trial 
this trial reached its primary endpoints and achieved its additional objectives earlier than anticipated 
the trial  therefore  used less clinical material than originally projected 
as a result of the early conclusion of the second trial  we had more cantuzumab mertansine inventory on hand than glaxosmithkline would reimburse 
as a result  in the quarter ended march   we wrote down the value of the inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
the inventory valuation allowance was charged to research and development expense in the three month period ended march  in the quarter ended june   enrollment and dosing were completed in the second phase i clinical trial 
as the second phase i clinical trial was complete  at june   we wrote down the cantuzumab mertansine inventory against the valuation allowance previously established 
the write down did not result in any additional charge or reversal of any portion of the previously established valuation allowance 
in the other phase i study of cantuzumab mertansine  we provided clinical material at our cost 
we wrote down the value of the hun prepaid assets and inventory based on an agreement with british biotech in which we agreed in principle that immunogen and british biotech would share in costs of antibody in excess of our estimates 
there were no similar charges during the year ended june  in fiscal  we entered into several agreements with outside vendors to perform ansamitocin p and dm process development 
included in the year ended june   and were million  million  and  respectively  of expenses related to ansamitocin p and dm process development 
in september  november  january and march  we entered into collaborations with morphosys ag  genzyme transgenics corporation  avalon pharmaceuticals  inc and raven biotechnologies  inc  respectively 
these agreements relate to our internal research and development efforts and our collaboration with british biotech 
included in the years ended june    and were  million and million  respectively  of expenses related to these agreements 
during the years ended june  and  we produced and batches of conjugates  respectively  on behalf of certain collaborators 
due to lower utilization of the norwood pilot manufacturing plant during as compared to the same period in  manufacturing and quality control costs included in research and development expense increased approximately million 
this increase represents the cost of operating the norwood plant that we were unable to allocate to the cost of batches manufactured on behalf of our collaborators during the period 
the number of research and development personnel increased to at june  compared to at june  we had research and development personnel at june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  facilities expense also increased by  during the year ended june  as compared to the same period in due to an increase in rent for the sidney street lease and expenses related to our new location at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
we expect future research and development expenses to increase as we continue development of our product candidates and technologies 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expense for the year ended june  increased to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million 
included in the general and administrative expense for the year ended june  was a payment of  for the settlement of a legal claim asserted against the company 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  and are reported net of  and  respectively  of expenses for which we are entitled to reimbursement from our collaborators 
as discussed above  we established a valuation allowance during the year ended june  to record the cantuzumab mertansine inventory at its estimated realizable value 
approximately  of the valuation allowance was recorded as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
facilities expense increased  due to an increase in rent for the sidney street lease and expenses related to our new location at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
the approximate  or  increase in general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to an increase of  for general and administrative salaries and related expenses  including estimated fiscal year bonuses that were accrued  an increase of  in professional services including legal and accounting fees  insurance costs and travel expenses  and a valuation allowance of  established to record cantuzumab mertansine inventory at its net realizable value 
interest income interest income for the year ended june  decreased to million from million for the year ended june  interest income for the year ended june  was million 
the decline in interest income from to is attributable to a lower average cash and investments balance combined with lower rates of return 
for the year ended june   our average cash and investment balances were higher than during the same period in the prior year  resulting from our november public stock offering  a collaborator investment of million in september  receipt of million in warrant exercise proceeds in september  and receipt of million and million in collaborator payments during the year ended june  and the year ended june   respectively 
however  rates of return during the year ended june  were lower than during the comparable period in the prior year 
the impact of higher average cash and investment balances was offset by lower rates of return  so that our interest income during the year ended june  declined compared with that of the same period in the prior year 
net realized gains on investments net realized gains on investments were   and  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
the increase in net realized gains is attributable to the timing of investment sales 
other income other income for the year ended june  increased to million from  for the same period in the prior year 
included in other income during the year ended june  is million  which represents the net gain on the final financial settlement of the glaxosmithkline collaboration 
other income for the year ended june  was  other income in the year ended june  included our receipt of a cash payment in settlement of a securities litigation case filed on our behalf 
liquidity and capital resources june  cash and short term investments    working capital    stockholders equity    cash flows as of june   we had approximately million in cash and short term investments 
in november  we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock 
net proceeds of the offering were million 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and general corporate purposes  including research and development 
since july   we have received million from collaborative and other financing sources 
these sources include milestone revenues earned under our collaboration agreements with glaxosmithkline  genentech  abgenix  millennium and boehringer ingelheim  the sale of equity securities to abgenix and the exercise of stock options and warrants to purchase common stock 
net cash used in operations during the year ended june  was million compared to net cash used in operations of million in the year ended june  net cash used in operations during the year ended june  was million 
this increase in operational cash use is largely due to the increase in operating expenses discussed previously as well as the increase in clinical materials inventory produced on behalf of our collaborators 
we received million  million  and million in upfront and milestone payments during the years ended june    and  respectively 
net cash provided by investing activities was million and million for the year ended june  and  respectively  and primarily represents the sales and maturities of marketable securities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended june  and primarily represents our investment of excess cash in marketable securities 
capital purchases were million and million for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively  and consisted primarily of costs associated with the build out of our existing norwood  massachusetts  development and pilot scale manufacturing facility and the renovation of our new laboratory and office facility at sidney street  cambridge  massachusetts 
net cash used for financing activities was million for the year ended june  net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended june  versus million provided by financing activities for the year ended june  for the year ended june   net cash used for financing activities includes the repurchase of  shares of common stock for million offset by proceeds from the exercise of  stock options 
for the year ended june   net cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from the exercise of  warrants and  stock options 
our total net proceeds from all common stock issued for the year ended june  were million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  includes proceeds from our november public offering of million shares of common stock as well as the exercise of  warrants and  stock options and the september  issuance of  shares of our common stock to abgenix 
our total net proceeds from all common stock issued for the year ended june  were million 
we anticipate that our current capital resources and future collaborator payments  including committed research funding that we expect to receive from aventis pursuant to the terms of our collaboration agreement  will enable us to meet our operational expenses and capital expenditures for at least the next five to seven years 
we believe that the proceeds from our november public stock offering in addition to our established collaborative agreements will provide funding sufficient to allow us to meet our obligations under all collaborative agreements while also allowing us to develop product candidates and technologies not covered by collaborative agreements 
however  we cannot provide assurance that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized 
should we not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
on august   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the open market repurchase of up to million shares of immunogen common stock 
the repurchases are to be made at the discretion of management and as market conditions warrant 
no time limit was set for the completion of the repurchase program 
as of september   the company had repurchased  shares of its common stock at a total cost of million 
as repurchases are at management s discretion and subject to market conditions  we are unable to estimate the total cost of the repurchase program or the period during which such repurchases may take place 
contractual obligations below is a table that presents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than one year years years more than years operating lease obligations    certain factors that may affect future results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
we caution investors that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the success of the company s research and clinical development processes  the difficulties inherent in the development of pharmaceuticals  including uncertainties as to the timing  expense and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the company s dependence upon existing and potential collaborative partners  uncertainty as to whether the company s potential products or those of the company s collaborators will succeed in entering human clinical trials and uncertainty as to the results of such trials  the risk that the company and or its collaborators may not be able to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to commercialize their product candidates  the potential development by competitors of competing products and technologies  uncertainty whether the company s tap technology will produce safe  effective and commercially viable products  the lack of assurance regarding patent and other protection for our proprietary technology  governmental regulation of our activities  facilities  products and personnel  the dependence on key personnel  uncertainties as to the extent of reimbursement for the costs of our potential products and related treatments by government and private health insurers and other organizations  the potential adverse impact of government directed health care reform  the risk of product liability claims  and economic conditions  both generally and those specifically related to the biotechnology industry 
as a result  our future development efforts involve a high degree of risk

recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for those companies who voluntarily change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition and annual disclosure provision of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provision of sfas is effective for interim periods beginning after december  we have not adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation and will continue to apply apb for our stock based compensation plans 
we incorporated the interim disclosure requirements of sfas at march  and incorporated the annual disclosure requirements of sfas in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  in november  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into after june  the provisions of the eitf issue no 
do not impact the accounting treatment of our existing revenue arrangements 
we believe that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will not result in a material change to our existing revenue recognition policy for prospective revenue arrangements 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item
