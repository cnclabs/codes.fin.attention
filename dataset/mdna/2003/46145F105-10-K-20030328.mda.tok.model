this transaction did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in many instances  the application of such principles requires management to make estimates or to apply subjective principles to particular facts and circumstances 
a change in the estimates or a variance in the application  or interpretation of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america could yield a materially different accounting result 
addressed below are the four policies where we believe that the estimations  judgments or interpretations that we made  if different  would have yielded the most significant differences in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangibles determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
for initial valuations  we retain valuation experts to provide us with independent fair value determinations of goodwill and other intangibles 
in addition  we perform valuations based on internally developed models 
specifically  a number of different methods are used in estimating the fair value of acquired intangibles as well as testing goodwill and other intangibles for impairment 
such methods include the income approach and the market approach 
significant estimates and assumptions applied in these approaches include  but are not limited to  projection of future cash flows  the applicable discount rate  perpetual growth rates  and adjustments made to assess the characteristics and relative performance of similar assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective january   we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be assessed no less than annually for impairment 
as of december   there was no impairment of goodwill 
other intangibles with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are assessed annually for impairment pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no

capitalized software pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  we capitalize software development costs where technological feasibility of a product has been established 
technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet design specifications 
all costs incurred to establish technological feasibility are expensed as incurred as required by sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
costs that are capitalized relate to new customer products or significant innovations to an existing customer product 
after technological feasibility has been established  we capitalize direct labor costs for specific tasks involving development and implementation activities 
such capitalized costs include an allocation of expenses incurred by our software development subsidiary including rent  depreciation  utilities  supplies and employee benefits 
the capitalization process continues until the product is released to customers  at which point amortization begins 
we are amortizing capitalized software costs using the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life of the related product  the life of which is months or less 
the assessment of recoverability of capitalized software development costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain external factors  including  but not limited to  anticipated future gross revenues  estimated economic life of a product and changes in software and hardware technologies 
in  and  other general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income included million  million and million  respectively  in relation to the amortization of capitalized software costs

soft dollar programs pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of section e of the exchange act  we permit institutional customers to allocate a portion of their gross commissions to pay for research products and other services provided by third parties 
the amounts so allocated for those purposes are commonly referred to as soft dollar arrangements 
we are accounting for the cost of independent research and directed brokerage arrangements on an accrual basis 
commission revenue is recorded when earned on a trade date basis 
our accounting for commission revenues includes the guidance contained in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenues gross versus net  and accordingly  payments relating to soft dollars are netted against the commission revenues 
prepaid soft dollar research balances are included in receivables from brokers  dealers and other and accrued soft dollar research payable balances are classified as accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and maintain an allowance for soft dollar advances which is comprised of a general reserve based on historical collections performance plus a specific reserve for certain known customer issues 
if actual bad debts are greater than the reserves calculated based on historical trends and known customer issues  we may be required to record additional bad debt expense  which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the periods in which such additional expense would occur

the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns

results of operations highlights we faced a very challenging economic environment in with low levels of institutional trading activity both in the us and international markets 
in order to align our infrastructure with expected levels of trading volume  we took actions to reduce our cost structure through the decision to terminate employees in december  representing personnel in our us operations and personnel in our international operations 
as a result of this reduction in our workforce  we recorded a million pretax charge  or per diluted share for the year ended december   consisting of severance for the employees and related costs 
the year ended december  reflects a full year of operating results for itg europe and ktg following our acquisition of itg europe in may and ktg in september additionally  the year ended december  also includes four months of hoenig results  following its september  acquisition

customers may discontinue use of our services at any time 
the loss of any significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers could result in lower share volumes of securities submitted to posit systems around the world  which may adversely affect the liquidity of the systems  reducing their attractiveness to our customers and adversely affect our trading volumes  operating results and financial condition 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity and capital resource requirements result from our working capital needs  primarily consisting of compensation and benefits  transaction processing fees and software royalty fees 
historically  cash from operations has met all working capital requirements 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements 
a substantial portion of our assets are liquid  consisting of cash and cash equivalents or assets readily convertible into cash 
we generally invest our excess cash in money market funds and other short term investments that generally mature within days or less 
additionally  securities owned at fair value include highly liquid  variable state and municipal obligations  auction rate preferred stock  us treasury securities  mutual fund investments  common stock and warrants 
at december   cash and cash equivalents and securities owned  at fair value amounted to million and net receivables from brokers  dealers and other  of million were due within days 
we also invest a portion of our excess cash balances in cash enhanced strategies  which we believe should yield higher returns without any significant effect on risk 
as of december   we had investments in limited partnerships totaling million  of which million were invested in marketable securities and million were invested in a venture capital fund 
the limited partnerships employ either a hedged convertible strategy or a long short strategy in an effort to capitalize on short term price movements 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities were million  a million decrease from the prior year 
the decrease was primarily attributable to i our september  estimated federal income tax payment  which was not paid until january in accordance with the tax relief provided by the us government to counties affected by the events of september   ii the reduction in net income and iii other changes in working capital 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   a million increase in our use of cash from the same period a year earlier  primarily as a result of i our september acquisition of hoenig for million  net of the cash amount on hoenig s balance sheet at the acquisition date  offset by ii our may acquisition of the of itg europe we did not already own and our september acquisition of ktg for million in the aggregate  net of the cash amount on their balance sheet at their respective acquisition date  and iii our investment in limited partnerships for million 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   an additional million use of cash compared to the same period a year earlier  primarily reflecting purchases of our common stock for million as part of our share repurchase program 
for the year ended december   cash flows from operating activities were million  an increase of million from the prior year 
the increase is primarily attributable to the growth in net income and other changes in working capital  partially offset by the decrease in the tax benefit from employee stock options  reflecting the exercise by employees of stock options with higher strike prices 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year 
this increase is primarily related to the million purchases of i the remaining stake in the itg europe joint venture and ii the assets of kastennet via ktg technologies corp 
in canada  net of cash acquired 
in  the company also invested million in limited partnerships 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   an increase of million from the prior year when the company purchased million worth of its common stock as part of the company s share repurchase program 
as part of our share repurchase program  our board of directors authorizes management to use its discretion to purchase an agreed upon maximum number of shares of common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
during the year ended december   we purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share and for million in the aggregate 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the year ended december  as of december   we were authorized to repurchase up to approximately million shares of common stock 
in january and february  we purchased approximately  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share for million in the aggregate 
the purchases are funded from our available cash resources 
the share repurchase program may be suspended at any time 
historically  all regulatory capital needs of itg inc  alternet and hoenig co  inc have been provided by cash from operations 
we believe that cash flows from operations will provide itg inc  alternet and hoenig co  inc with sufficient regulatory capital 
at december   itg inc  alternet and hoenig co  inc 
had net capital of million  million and million  respectively  of which million  million and million  respectively  was in excess of required net capital 
in addition  our canadian  australian  european and asian operations had regulatory capital in excess of the minimum requirements applicable to each business as of december  of approximately million  million  million and million  respectively 
although we believe that the combination of our existing net regulatory capital and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet regulatory capital requirements  a shortfall in net regulatory capital would have a material adverse effect on us 
we do not currently maintain any credit facilities in the event of a regulatory capital shortfall 
as of december   hoenig co  inc held a million cash balance in a segregated bank account for the benefit of customers under certain directed brokerage arrangements 
in addition  hoenig co  inc computes a deposit due on any fail to receive deliver for foreign securities of their customers transacted through its foreign affiliates 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are involved in the execution of various customer securities transactions 
securities transactions are subject to the credit risk of counterparties or customer nonperformance 
in connection with the settlement of non us securities transactions  investment technology group  inc has provided third party financial institutions with guarantees in amounts up to a maximum of million 
in the event that a customer of itg s subsidiaries fails to settle a securities transaction or if the related itg s subsidiaries were unable to honor trades with a customer  investment technology group  inc would be required to perform for the amount of such securities up to the million cap 
however  transactions are collateralized by the underlying security  thereby reducing the associated risk to changes in the market value of the security through settlement date 
therefore  the settlement of these transactions is not expected to have a material effect upon our financial statements 
it is also our policy to review  as necessary  the credit worthiness of each counterparty and customer 
aggregate contractual obligations as of december   our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments amounted to million in the aggregate and consisted of the following dollars in thousands payments due during the year ending december  and thereafter future minimum rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases minimum compensation under six employment agreements at hoenig  total       as of december   we did not have any long term debt 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
the adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
as of december   we account for stock based employee compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted by sfas no 
in accordance with apb no 
 compensation expense is not recognized for stock options that have no intrinsic value on the date of grant 
effective in fiscal  we will begin to account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 using the prospective adoption method 
under this method of adoption  compensation expense will be recognized based on the fair value of stock options and or restricted stock units granted for fiscal and future years over the related service period 
the amount of stock based compensation to be recognized under sfas no 
in fiscal and beyond is not currently determinable because the number and value of stock options and or restricted stock units to be granted to employees in the future is not yet known  nor are the related future service provisions 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
see above discussion of off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
in january  the fasb also issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which applies immediately to variable interest entities such as trusts  limited partnerships and limited liability companies created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  interpretation no 
requires the identification of variable interest entities and the assessment of interests in a variable interest entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity 
variable interest entities are identified by reviewing our equity investments at risk  our ability to make decisions about the entity s activities and the obligation to absorb the entity s losses or right to receive expected residual results 
we are currently assessing each entity with which we are associated 
we have limited partnership interests in several limited partnerships and an equity interest in the posit joint venture  which is not currently consolidated 
we do not expect the adoption of interpretation no 
to have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
issues and uncertainties while our management s long term expectations are optimistic  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our growth outlook 
financial market conditions and economic conditions over the last year  the financial markets in the us and elsewhere have exhibited increased volatility and many worldwide financial indices have continued to decline 
our business is materially affected by conditions in both domestic and foreign financial markets 
we anticipate a continuation of weak institutional trading volumes in and have seen january and february volumes tracking lower than those achieved in the fourth quarter of the demand for our securities brokerage and related services are also directly affected by factors such as economic and political conditions that may lead to decreased trading activity and prices in the securities markets generally 
the future economic environment may be subject to periodic economic downturns  such as recessions  as well as geopolitical unrest  which could also result in reduced trading volumes and prices  which could materially harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
decreases in trading volumes or market prices declines in the volume of securities trading and in market liquidity generally result in lower revenues from our posit  client site and electronic trading desk products 
in addition  our trading commissions outside the us and canada are based on the value of transactions rather than volume based  which would be adversely affected by price declines 
our profitability would be adversely affected by a decline in trading revenues because a significant portion of our costs are fixed 
for these reasons  decreases in trading volume or securities prices could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
regulation general the securities markets and the brokerage industry in which we operate are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and other jurisdictions around the world 
we face the risk of significant intervention by regulatory authorities in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
in our case  the impact of regulation extends beyond traditional areas of securities regulation  such as disclosure and prohibitions on fraud and manipulation by market participants  to the regulation of the structure of markets 
the securities industry has been subject to several fundamental regulatory changes 
in the future  the industry may become subject to new regulations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations  which may adversely affect our business 
the markets for equity securities have been subject to the most significant regulatory changes 
we cannot predict the extent to which any future regulatory changes can affect our business 
regulation ats before regulation ats went into effect on april   we operated posit pursuant to a no action letter from the sec staff which stated that it would not commence an enforcement action if posit were operated without registering as an exchange 
we are currently operating posit  triact and smartservers as part of our broker dealer operations in accordance with regulation ats 
accordingly  none of posit  triact or smartservers are registered with the sec as an exchange 
there can be no assurance that the sec will not in the future seek to impose more stringent regulatory requirements on the operation of alternative trading systems such as posit  triact and smartservers 
there can be no assurance that congress will not enact additional legislation applicable to alternative trading systems 
net capital requirement each of our broker dealer subsidiaries is subject to regulatory capital requirements promulgated by the regulatory and exchange authorities of the countries in which they operate 
the failure by any of these subsidiaries to maintain its required regulatory capital may lead to suspension or revocation of its broker dealer registration and its suspension or expulsion by us or international regulatory bodies  and ultimately could require its liquidation 
we do not currently maintain any credit facilities in the event of a regulatory capital shortfall 
competition the financial services industry generally  and the securities brokerage business in which we engage in particular  is extremely competitive  and we expect it to remain so 
the brokerage and related services offered by us compete with services provided by leading brokerage firms and transaction processing firms and with providers of electronic trading and trade order management systems and financial information services 
posit also competes with various national and regional securities exchanges and execution facilities  the nasdaq national market  atss and ecns for trade execution services 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources 
many of them offer a wider range of services  have broader name recognition and have larger customer bases than we do 
outside the united states  in addition to our us competitors with international capabilities  we compete with non us financial service companies that may also have long standing  well established relations with their clients  some of which also hold dominant positions in their trading markets 
we compete on the basis of a number of factors  including access to liquidity  transaction execution  our products and services  innovation  reputation and price 
insufficient system capacity or system failures our business relies heavily on the computer and communications systems supporting our operations 
peak trading times and times of unusual market volatility could cause our systems to operate slowly or even fail for periods of time 
general power or telecommunications failures or natural disasters could cause blackouts in our systems 
the presence of computer viruses can also cause failure of our systems 
as our business expands  we will need to expand our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions 
if any of our systems do not operate properly or are disabled  we could incur financial loss  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
system failure or degradation could lead our customers to file formal complaints with industry regulatory organizations  initiate regulatory inquiries or proceedings  file lawsuits against us  trade less frequently through us or cease doing business with us 
rapid changes in technology due to the high demand for technology based services in the securities industry  we are subject to rapid technological change and evolving industry standards 
also  customer demands become greater and more sophisticated as the dissemination of information to customers increases 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demand for new services  products and technologies in a timely and cost effective manner and to adapt to the technological advancements and changing standards  we will be less able to compete effectively  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk from third parties that owe us money  securities  or other obligations  including our customers and trading counterparties 
these parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy  lack of liquidity  operational failure or other reasons 
substantially all of the clearing and depository operations for our broker dealer subsidiaries are performed pursuant to clearing agreements with their clearing brokers  who review the credit risk of trading counterparties  as deemed necessary 
volatile securities markets  credit markets and regulatory changes increase our exposure to credit risk  which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
license and relationship with barra we have a perpetual license with the posit joint venture  which is a joint venture we have with barra 
the license grants itg inc the exclusive right to use certain proprietary software necessary to the continued operation of posit in the us and a non exclusive license to use proprietary software that operates in conjunction with posit 
the license agreement permits barra on behalf of the joint venture to terminate the agreement upon certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency or upon an uncured breach by itg inc of certain covenants the performance of which are all within our control 
although we do not believe that we will experience difficulty in complying with our obligations under the license agreement  any termination of the license agreement resulting from an uncured default would have a material adverse effect on us 
the posit joint venture also licensed to itg australia limited  itg europe and itg hong kong the right to use the posit technology for crossing australian  european and asian equity securities 
these licenses contain substantially the same default and termination provisions as the us license 
infrastructure and research in connection with our research and product development activities  as well as capital expenditures to improve other aspects of our business  we incur substantial expenses that do not vary directly  at least in the short term  with fluctuations in securities transaction volumes and revenues 
in the event of a material reduction in revenues  we may not be able to reduce such expenses quickly and  as a result  we could experience reduced profitability or losses 
conversely  sudden surges in transaction volumes can result in increased profit and profit margin 
to ensure that we have the capacity to process projected increases in transaction volumes  we have historically made substantial capital and operating expenditures in advance of such projected increases  including during periods of low transaction volumes 
in the event that such growth in transaction volumes does not occur  the expenses related to such investments could cause reduced profitability or losses 
changes in our customer base changes in our customer base which includes institutional investors  portfolio managers  hedge funds and broker dealers can materially affect our profitability and net income 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from our largest customers 
the loss of any significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the loss of significant posit customers or a significant reduction in liquidity provided by a customer could result in lower share volumes of securities submitted to posit systems around the world  which may adversely affect the liquidity of the systems  reducing their attractiveness to our customers and adversely affect our trading volumes  operating results and financial condition 
dependence on third party suppliers for key services we depend on a number of third parties to supply elements of our trading systems  computers and other equipment  and related support and maintenance 
we cannot be certain that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient and cost effective manner or that they will be able to meet our expanding needs 
if we are unable to make alternative arrangements for the supply of these services in the event of a disruption in the services  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
risks of infringement of our intellectual property rights we rely upon patents  copyrights  trademarks and trade secrets to establish and protect our rights in our proprietary technology  methods and products 
however  a third party may still try to challenge  invalidate or circumvent the mechanisms we select to protect our rights 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us in the past several years  there has been a proliferation of so called business method patents applicable to the computer and financial services industries 
under current law  us patent applications remain secret for months and may  depending upon where else such applications are filed  remain secret until issuance of a patent 
thus it is not economically practicable to determine in advance whether our products or services may infringe the present or future patent rights of others 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology from disclosure or that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
it is likely that from time to time we may also face claims that use of technology material to our business operations infringes on rights of third parties or we may be called upon to defend a joint venture partner  customer or licensee against such third party claims  which could consume valuable time  result in costly litigation or cause delays  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk refers to the potential for adverse changes in the value of a company s financial instruments as a result of changes in market conditions 
we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices to the extent we own such instruments in our portfolio 
we do not engage in speculative or leveraged transactions  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we continually evaluate our exposure to market risk and oversee the establishment of policies  procedures and controls to ensure that market risks are identified and analyzed on an ongoing basis 
we have performed sensitivity analyses on different tests of market risk as described in the following sections to estimate the impacts of a hypothetical change in market conditions on the fair value of securities owned and the us dollar value of us dollar based revenues associated with our international operations 
estimated potential losses assume the occurrence of certain adverse market conditions 
such estimates do not consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors and also do not represent management s expectations of projected losses in fair value 
we do not foresee any significant changes in the strategies used to manage interest rate risk  foreign currency risk or equity price risk in the near future 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to interest sensitive financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest sensitive financial instruments will decline in value if interest rates increase 
our interest bearing investment portfolio primarily consists of short term  high credit quality money market funds  highly liquid variable rate municipal securities  auction rate preferred stock and treasury notes 
the aggregate fair market value of our portfolio was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our interest bearing investments are not insured and because of the short term high quality nature of the investments are not likely to fluctuate significantly in market value 
for the years ended december   and  we estimated that a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would have resulted in a million  million and million decline in the fair value of our portfolio  respectively 
foreign currency risk we are seeking to expand globally in a variety of ways  including through our operations in canada  australia  europe and hong kong  and through the development of specially tailored versions of our services 
additionally  we maintain development facilities in israel 
our investments and development activities in these countries expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the british pound sterling  euro  australian dollar  canadian dollar  hong kong dollar and israeli new shekel 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based revenue decreases 
to the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase in the future  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates will correspondingly increase 
we have not engaged in derivative financial instruments as a means of hedging this risk 
non us dollar cash balances held overseas are generally kept at levels necessary to meet current operating and capitalization needs 
approximately  and of our revenues as of december   and were denominated in non us dollar currencies 
for the years ended december   and  we estimated that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign exchange rates would have resulted in a million  million and million loss in revenue from our international operations  respectively  and further deterioration in net losses of million  million and million  respectively 
equity price risk equity price risk results from exposure to changes in the prices of equity securities 
as part of our full service equity trade execution business we do not engage in proprietary trading  however  at times we do hold positions overnight due to client or company errors 
equity price risk can arise from liquidating such positions 
accordingly  we maintain policies and procedures regarding the management of our errors and accommodations proprietary trading accounts 
it is our policy to attempt to trade out of all positions arising from errors and accommodations immediately while balancing our exposure to market risk 
certain positions may therefore be liquidated over a period of time in an effort to minimize market impact 
we manage equity price risk associated with open positions through the establishment and monitoring of trading policies and through controls and review procedures that ensure communication and timely resolution of trading issues 
our operations department reviews all open trades intraday in an effort to ensure that any open issues are addressed and resolved by the close of the trading day 
additionally  our clearing broker notifies us of all known trade discrepancies on the day following the trade date 
we have also established approval policies that include review by a supervisory principal of any proprietary trading activity 
our cash management strategy seeks to optimize excess liquid assets by preserving principal  maintaining liquidity to satisfy capital requirements  minimizing risk and maximizing our after tax rate of return 
our policy is to invest in high quality credit issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer and invest in tax efficient strategies 
our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and re investment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to reductions in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor that we believe is adverse to our investment strategy 
for working capital purposes  we invest only in money market instruments 
cash balances that are not needed for normal operations are invested in a tax efficient manner in instruments with appropriate maturities and levels of risk to correspond to expected liquidity needs 
we currently have investments in municipal bonds  auction rate preferred bonds and  to a lesser extent  common stock 
to the extent that we invest in marketable equity securities  we ensure portfolio liquidity by investing in marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
at december  and  our cash and cash equivalents and securities owned were approximately million and million  respectively 
our investments in limited partnership funds require approval of executive management and or the board of directors 
at december  and  investments in limited partnerships investing in marketable securities and a venture capital fund were approximately million and million  respectively
