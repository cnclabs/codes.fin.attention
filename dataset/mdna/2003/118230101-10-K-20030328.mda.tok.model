item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of the liquidity and capital resources and the results of operations of the partnership for the periods indicated below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which are included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations through its operating partnerships and their subsidiaries  the partnership is principally engaged in the pipeline transportation of refined petroleum products and  between march and october   the refining of transmix 
products transported via pipeline include gasoline  jet fuel  diesel fuel  heating oil  kerosene and liquid propane gases lpgs 
the partnership s revenues derived from the transportation of refined petroleum products are principally a function of the volumes of refined petroleum products transported by the partnership  which are in turn a function of the demand for refined petroleum products in the regions served by the partnership s pipelines  and the tariffs or transportation fees charged for such transportation 
the partnership is also engaged  through bph  bt and bgc  in the terminalling and storage of petroleum products and in contract operations of pipelines for third parties 
revenues for each of the three years in the period ended december  were as follows revenues in thousands pipeline transportation    terminalling  storage and rentals    contract operations    total    results of operations are affected by factors that include general economic conditions  weather  competitive conditions  demand for refined petroleum products  seasonal factors and regulation 
see business competition and other business considerations 
compared with total revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent greater than revenue of million in revenue from pipeline transportation was million in compared to million in of the million increase in pipeline transportation revenue  million is related to a full year of norco operations in compared to five months of norco operations in volumes delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in revenue from the transportation of gasoline of million increased by million  or percent  from levels 
million of the increase in gasoline transportation revenue was related to a full year of norco operations 
total gasoline volumes of  barrels per day in were  barrels per day  or percent greater than volumes of  barrels per day 
norco gasoline volumes for a full year of operations in were  barrels per day compared to  barrels per day for five months of operations in in the east  gasoline volumes of  barrels per day were approximately  barrels per day  or percent  greater than volumes 
the increase was primarily due to greater deliveries to the upstate new york and pittsburgh  pennsylvania areas 
in the midwest  gasoline volumes of  barrels per day were  barrels per day  or percent  less than gasoline volumes delivered during demand for gasoline transportation was generally lower throughout the region with the largest declines occurring in the detroit and bay city  michigan areas 
long island system gasoline volumes of  barrels per day were up  barrels per day  or percent  due to additional available capacity on this system following reductions in turbine fuel demand after september  on the jet lines system  gasoline volumes of  barrels per day were  barrels per day  or percent  less than volumes due to lower transportation demand in the hartford  connecticut area 
revenue from the transportation of distillate of million increased by million  or percent  from levels 
norco s distillate transportation revenue increased by million in reflecting a full year of operations 
total volumes of  barrels per day in were  barrels per day  or percent less than distillate volumes of  barrels per day 
norco distillate volumes for a full year of operations in were  barrels per day compared to  barrels per for five months of operations in in the east  distillate volumes of  barrels per day were approximately  barrels per day  or percent  less than volumes 
in the midwest  distillate volumes of  barrels per day were  barrels per day  or percent  less than volumes delivered during long island system distillate volumes of  barrels per day were down barrels per day or percent less than volumes delivered during on the jet lines system  distillate volumes of  barrels per day were  barrels per day  or percent  less than volumes 
distillate volumes declined during the first quarter of compared to the first quarter due to milder than normal winter conditions 
during the fourth quarter  distillate volumes increased over fourth quarter volumes as winter conditions returned to more normal levels 
the increase  however  did not fully offset the decline that occurred during the first quarter of the year 
revenue from the transportation of jet fuel of million decreased by million  or percent  from levels 
norco does not transport turbine fuel 
in may  wespac commenced turbine fuel deliveries to san diego airport 
wespac s turbine fuel revenue was up million primarily due to a full year of deliveries to san diego airport during total jet fuel volumes of  barrels per day in were  barrels per day  or percent less than jet fuel volumes of  barrels per day 
wespac s jet fuel volumes of  barrels per day were up  barrels per day due to a full year of deliveries to san diego airport 
deliveries to new york city airports declined by  barrels per day  or percent 
deliveries to pittsburgh airport declined by  barrels per day  or percent  while deliveries to miami airport declined  barrels per day  or percent 
volumes to all major airports declined as a result of reduced airline travel following the terrorist attacks on september  although deliveries to major airports have improved from the dramatic decline immediately following september   the outlook for further recovery of turbine fuel volumes to pre september  levels is uncertain due to airline schedule reductions  reduced consumer air travel and the threat of further terrorist attacks 
terminalling  storage and rental revenue of million increased by million in primarily due to a full year of norco operations 
contract operation services revenue of million increased by million due to additional contracts obtained by bgc during and contract operations revenues typically consist of costs reimbursable under the contracts plus an operator s fee 
accordingly  revenues from these operations carry a lower gross profit percentage than revenues from pipeline transportation or terminalling  storage and rentals 
the partnership s costs and expenses for were million compared to million for bgc s costs and expenses increased by million over as a result of additional contract services provided 
a full year of norco operations resulted in an additional million of operating expense 
other increases of million are primarily related to general wage increases  increases in payroll overhead costs  increases in the use of outside services  increases in power costs related to additional pipeline volumes and higher insurance premiums 
other income and expense for was a net cost of million compared to million in the increase is primarily due to higher interest expense on additional borrowings during and related to acquisitions and certain capital expenditures 
compared with total revenue for the year ended december  was million  million or percent greater than revenue of million in revenue derived from the pipeline transportation of refined products was million in compared to million in of the million increase in pipeline transportation revenue  million of the increase was related to the norco acquisition 
volumes delivered during averaged  barrels per day   barrels per day or percent greater than volume of  barrels per day delivered in the norco acquisition represented  barrels per day of the volumes transported in revenue from the transportation of gasoline increased by million  or percent  from levels  of which million was related to the norco acquisition 
in the east  deliveries to the pittsburgh  pennsylvania and upstate new york areas increased compared to volumes due to strong demand there 
in the midwest  volumes and revenue declined compared to volumes primarily as the result of decreased deliveries to the bay city  michigan area 
deliveries to bay city were unusually high in following the closure of a refinery in that area 
revenue from the transportation of distillate volumes increased by million  or percent  over levels  of which million was related to the norco acquisition 
distillate deliveries for the year were up primarily due to the colder than normal weather experienced during the first and second quarter of revenue from the transportation of jet fuel decreased by million  or percent  from levels 
norco does not transport turbine fuel 
in may  wespac commenced turbine fuel deliveries to san diego airport 
this new business added million to revenues 
through september   turbine fuel revenue was approximately percent above prior year levels 
however  the terrorist attacks of september th greatly curtailed air travel during the balance of september and the fourth quarter of turbine fuel deliveries declined by percent overall during the fourth quarter of turbine fuel volumes improved in december as air travel began to recover but was still down by approximately percent overall from december levels 
deliveries to new york area airports were particularly affected  with a percent decline in october  a percent decline in november and an percent decline in december from year earlier volumes 
this greater than average decline reflects the larger percentage of international flights at these airports as compared to other jet fuel delivery locations 
revenue from the transportation of liquefied petroleum products lpg increased by million  or percent  over levels 
norco does not transport lpg product 
the increase in lpg revenues is related to primarily to new business at lima  ohio 
terminalling  storage and rental revenue of million increased by million in million is due to an increase in terminalling and storage revenue of which million is related to the norco acquisition with the balance primarily resulting from a full year of operations related to the agway terminal acquisition on june  rental revenue increased by million during of which million is related to the norco and agway acquisitions 
contract operation services revenue of million increased by million due to additional contracts obtained by bgc during and costs and expenses for were million compared to costs and expenses of million for bgc s costs and expenses increased by million over as result of additional contract services provided 
another million of the expense increase is related to the norco and agway acquisitions 
other increases of million are primarily related to general wage increases  increased payroll overhead costs  an increase in the use of outside services  increased power costs related to additional pipeline deliveries and higher insurance premiums 
other expenses for were million compared to million in a million gain realized on the sale of property in did not recur in in addition  incentive compensation payments to the general partner that are based on the level of partnership distributions were approximately million greater during than due to an increase in the level of cash distributions paid to limited partners 
investment income increased primarily as the result of a million gain on the tendering of preferred stock back to aerie networks  inc aerie 
the preferred stock had been issued by aerie in exchange for assisting aerie with its development of a fiber optics network along the partnership s rights of way 
discontinued operations in  net income of million from the discontinued operations of brc resulted from revenues of million offset by costs and expenses of million 
brc was sold to kinder morgan energy partners  lp for an aggregate sale price of million on october  the sale resulted in a gain of million see
