table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions or conditions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our policy follows the guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  presentation  and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped or the services have been provided to the client  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
during fiscal year  approximately of our revenue is recognized based on transaction volumes  approximately is related to time and material contracts  approximately is related to cost reimbursable contracts  approximately of our revenues are recognized using percentage of completion accounting and the remainder is fixed fee based 
generally  information technology processing revenues are recognized as services are provided to the client 
revenues from annual maintenance contracts are deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenues from hardware sales are recognized upon delivery to the client and when uncertainties regarding customer acceptance have expired 
revenues for business process outsourcing services are recognized as services are rendered  generally on the basis of the number of accounts or transactions processed 
in the federal government segment  our contracts are typically cost reimbursable  fixed price  unit price  or time and material contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred  such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience 
revenues on unit price contracts are recognized at the contractual selling prices of work completed and accepted by the client 
revenues on time and material contracts are recognized at the contractual rates as the labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
revenues on certain fixed price contracts where we provide information technology development and implementation services and certain contracts in our federal government segment are recognized over the contract term based on the percentage of development and implementation services that are provided during the period compared with the total estimated development and implementation services to be provided over the entire contract using statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
sop requires the use of percentage of completion accounting for long term contracts that are binding agreements between us and our customers in which we agree  for compensation  to perform a service to the customer s specifications 
performance will often extend over long periods  and our right to receive payment depends on our performance in accordance with the agreement 
the percentage of completion methodology involves recognizing revenue using the percentage of services completed  on a current cumulative cost to total cost basis  using a reasonably consistent profit margin over the period 
due to the long term nature of these contracts  developing the estimates of costs often requires significant judgment 
factors that must be considered in estimating the progress of work completed and ultimate cost of the contract include  but are not limited to  the availability of labor and labor productivity  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the impact of delayed performance  and availability and timing of funding from the client 
if changes occur in delivery  productivity or other factors used in developing the estimates of costs or revenues  we revise our cost and revenue estimates  which may result in increases or decreases in revenues and costs  and such revisions are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to that revision become known 

table of contents emerging issues task force issue accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf addresses the accounting treatment for an arrangement to provide the delivery or performance of multiple products and or services where the delivery of a product or system or performance of services may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding  among other issues  the applicability of the provisions regarding separation of contract elements in eitf to contracts where one or more elements fall within the scope of other authoritative literature  such as sop eitf does not impact the use of sop for contract elements that fall within the scope of sop  such as the implementation or development of an information technology system to client specifications under a long term contract 
where an implementation or development project is contracted with a client  and we will also provide services or operate the system over a period of time  eitf provides the methodology for separating the contract elements and allocating total arrangement consideration to the contract elements 
the provisions of eitf will be applicable on a prospective basis to transactions entered into in fiscal years beginning after june  we believe that eitf will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
revenues earned in excess of related billings are accrued  whereas billings in excess of revenues earned are deferred until the related services are provided 
immediate recognition is made of any anticipated losses 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles 
due to the fact that we are primarily a services company  our business acquisitions typically result in significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible expense we could incur as a result of an impairment 
the determination of the value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the balance of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of expected future cash flows derived from the goodwill or intangible asset 
such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues  costs and expenses and other factors 
if an event occurs which would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms and collection trends when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
any change in the assumptions used in analyzing a specific account receivable may result in additional allowance for doubtful accounts being recognized in the period in which the change occurs

risks related to our business the risks described below should not be considered to be comprehensive and all inclusive 
additional risks that we do not yet know of or that we currently think are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any events occur that give rise to the following risks  our business  financial condition  cash flow or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected  and as a result  the trading price of our class a common stock could be materially and adversely impacted 
these risk factors should be read in conjunction with other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
loss of  or reduction of business from  clients 
the loss of clients and or the reduction of volumes and services provided to our clients could materially affect our revenues  profitability and cash flows 
in addition  we incur a high level of fixed costs related to our technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing clients 
therefore the loss of any one of our significant clients could leave us with a significantly higher level of fixed costs than is necessary to serve our remaining clients  thereby reducing our revenues  profitability and cash flow 
termination of a contract by a client or deterioration of the financial condition of a client 
we must make significant capital investments in order to attract and retain large outsourcing agreements 
the termination of a client contract or the deterioration of the financial condition or prospects of a client has in the past  and may in the future  result in an impairment of the net book value of the assets recorded  including a portion of our intangible assets  and a reduction in our earnings and cash flow 
competition 
we expect to encounter additional competition as we address new markets and new competitors enter our existing markets 
if we are forced to lower our pricing or if demand for our services decreases  our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow may be materially and adversely affected 
many of our competitors have greater resources  and they may be able to use their resources to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products and services 
in addition  we must frequently compete with a client s own internal business process and information technology capabilities  which may constitute a fixed cost for the client 
difficulties in executing our acquisition strategy 
we intend to continue to expand our business through the acquisition of complementary companies 
we cannot  however  make any assurances that we will be able to identify any potential acquisition candidates or consummate any additional acquisitions or that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated or will be advantageous to us 
without additional acquisitions  we are unlikely to maintain historical total growth rates 
failure to properly manage our operations and our growth 
we have rapidly expanded our operations in recent years 
we intend to continue expansion in the foreseeable future to pursue existing and potential market opportunities 
this rapid growth places a significant demand on our management and operational resources 
in order to manage growth effectively  we must implement and improve our operational systems  procedures  and controls on a timely basis 
if we fail to implement these systems  procedures and controls on a timely basis  we may not be able to service our clients needs  hire and retain new 
table of contents employees  pursue new business  complete future acquisitions or operate our businesses effectively 
we could also trigger contractual credits to clients 
failure to properly integrate acquired operations with vendors systems could result in increased cost 
government clients termination rights  audits and investigations 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with the united states government and its agencies and from contracts with state and local governments and their agencies 
governments and their agencies may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
also  our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the united states congress to fund the expenditures to be made by the federal government under these contracts 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies 
if the government finds that we improperly charged any costs to a contract  the costs are not reimbursable or  if already reimbursed  the cost must be refunded to the government 
if the government discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  the contractor may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government 
any resulting penalties or sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial results and cash flow 
exercise of contract termination provisions and service level penalties 
most of our contracts with our clients permit termination in the event our performance is not consistent with service levels specified in those contracts  or provide for credits to our clients for failure to meet service levels 
in addition  if clients are not satisfied with our level of performance  our reputation in the industry may suffer  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flow 
pricing risks 
some of our contracts contain provisions requiring that our services be priced based on a pre established standard or benchmark regardless of the costs we incur in performing these services 
some of our contracts contain pricing provisions that require the client to pay a set fee for our services regardless of whether our costs to perform these services exceed the amount of the set fee 
some of our contracts contain re pricing provisions which can result in reductions of our fees for performing our services 
in such situations  we are exposed to the risk that we may be unable to price our services to levels that will permit recovery of our costs  and may adversely affect our operating results and cash flow 
loss of significant software vendor relationships 
our ability to service our clients depends to a large extent on our use of various software programs that we license from a small number of primary software vendors 
if our significant software vendors were to terminate or refuse to renew our contracts with them  we might not be able to replace the related software programs and would be unable to serve our clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  revenues  profitability and cash flow 
rapid technological changes 
the markets for our information technology services are subject to rapid technological changes and rapid changes in client requirements 
we may be unable to timely and successfully customize products and services that incorporate new technology or to deliver the services and products demanded by the marketplace 
intellectual property infringement claims 
we rely heavily on the use of intellectual property 
we do not own the majority of the software that we use to run our business  instead we license this software from a small number of primary vendors 
if these vendors assert claims that we or our clients are infringing on their software or related intellectual property  we could incur substantial costs to defend these claims  which could have a material effect on our profitability and cash flow 
in addition  if any of our vendors infringement claims are ultimately successful  our vendors could require us to cease selling or using products or services that incorporate the challenged software or technology  to obtain a license or additional licenses from our vendors  or to redesign our products and services which rely on the challenged software or technology 
if we are unsuccessful in the defense of an infringement claim and our vendors require us to initiate any of the above actions  then such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
federal regulations relating to confidentiality of health data 
in  congress passed the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa and as required therein  the secretary of health and human services hhs has established standards for information sharing  security and confidentiality with regard to health information of individuals 
we process individually identifiable health information for many of our clients 
we and our clients are required to comply with hipaa and we will be required to comply with hipaa for individually identifiable health information which we maintain for our employees 
health information privacy regulations promulgated under hipaa took effect on april  on or prior to 
table of contents that date we implemented procedures  training and security features designed to protect the privacy and integrity of such health information 
other regulations have been published under hipaa such as those related to the standardization of information used in processing healthcare transactions which require compliance by october and those related to additional security measures that must be implemented by april and other regulations required by hipaa have yet to be published 
in addition  various states  including texas  have passed legislation that addresses medical record privacy and restricts the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information  and other federal or state privacy legislation may be enacted at any time 
hipaa subjects us  as a service provider and as an employer  to liability and monetary penalties for failure to comply with hipaa regulations 
if we fail to comply with hipaa regulations and applicable state laws  we could incur liability under these provisions  which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flow 
budget deficits at state and local governments and their agencies 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from contracts with state and local governments and their agencies 
currently  many state and local governments that we have contracts with are facing potential budget deficits 
while this has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations through the fiscal year  it is unclear what impact  if any  these deficits may have on our future business  revenues  results of operations and cash flow 
international risks 
recently we have expanded our international operations 
international operations are subject to a number of risks including  but not limited to the following fluctuations in foreign exchange currency rates  licensing and labor counsel requirements  staffing key managerial positions  data privacy laws adopted by various countries in which acs does business  including but not limited to member states of the european union  general economic conditions in foreign countries  additional expenses and risks inherent in conducting operations in geographically distant locations  laws of those foreign countries  political instability  trade restrictions such as tariffs and duties or other controls affecting foreign operations  and other factors that may adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
armed hostilities and terrorist attacks 
terrorist attacks and further acts of violence or war may cause major instability in the us and other financial markets in which we operate 
in addition  armed hostilities and acts of terrorism may directly impact our physical facilities and operations  which are located in north america  central america  south america  europe  africa  australia  asia and the middle east  or those of our clients 
these developments subject our worldwide operations to increased risks and  depending on their magnitude  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to attract and retain necessary technical personnel and skilled management and qualified subcontractors 
our success depends to a significant extent upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel and to subcontract with qualified  competent subcontractors 
if we fail to attract  train  and retain  sufficient numbers of these technically skilled people or are unable to contract with qualified  competent subcontractors  our business  financial condition  and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
our success also depends on the skills  experience  and performance of key members of our management team and on qualified  competent subcontractors 
the loss of any key employee or the loss of a key subcontract relationship could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  cash flow and results of operations and prospects 
servicing risks 
we service for various lenders and under various service agreements a portfolio of over billion of loans made under the federal family loan education loan program  which loans are guaranteed by a federal government agency 
if a loan is in default  then a claim is made upon the guarantor 
if the guarantor denies the claim because of a servicing error  then under certain of the servicing agreements we may be required to purchase the loan from the lender 
upon purchase of the loan  we attempt to cure the servicing errors and either sell the loan back to the guarantor which must occur within a specified period of time or sell the loan on the open market to a third party 
we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to cure the servicing errors or sell the loan on the open market 
our reserves  which are based on historical information  may be inadequate if our servicing performance results in the requirement that we repurchase a substantial number of loans  which repurchase could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow and profitability 
disruption in utility or network services 
our services are dependent on the companies providing electricity and other utilities to our operating facilities  as well as network companies providing connectivity to our facilities and clients 
while there are backup systems in many of our operating facilities  an extended outage of utility services may have a material adverse effect on our operations  revenues  cash flow and profitability 

table of contents indemnification risk 
our contracts  including our agreements with respect to divestitures  include various indemnification obligations 
if we are required to satisfy an indemnification obligation  that may have a material adverse effect on our business  profitability and cash flow 
other risks 
we have attempted to identify material risk factors currently affecting our business and company 
however  additional risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently think are immaterial  may occur or become material 
these risks could impair our business operations or adversely affect revenues  cash flow or profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have fixed rate and variable rate debt instruments 
our variable rate debt instruments are subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
during the first half of fiscal year  in order to manage interest costs and exposure to changing interest rates related to our then existing million revolving line of credit  we held two interest rate hedges initiated in december each hedge was designated a cash flow hedge and was structured such that we paid a fixed rate of interest of on amounts owed under the revolving line of credit up to the notional amount  and received a floating rate of interest based on one month libor 
the notional amount of the two hedges totaled million and expired in december changes in the fair value of the interest rate hedges  net of tax effect  is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we held a single investment in a marketable security during fiscal year to protect ourselves from the volatility of the value of this marketable security investment  we entered into a no cost collar agreement in june  which matured in june the collar  a fair value hedge  was structured so that all fluctuations in the price of the marketable security above or below or of its value on the date the collar was entered into are hedged 
this marketable security investment was liquidated as of june   and the related collar was terminated 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivative transactions 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in the interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future earnings  fair value  or cash flows
