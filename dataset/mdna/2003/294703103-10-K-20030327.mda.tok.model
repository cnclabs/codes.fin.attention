the allowance established has fully reserved for the notes as of december  effective january   the company leased of its hotels to wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries that are subject to federal and state income taxes 
in years ending before january   the company was not subject to federal and state income tax because of its reit status

the company currently expects that its operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our continuing operations  including our required debt service obligations other than the maturity of the line of credit which we expect to refinance in as discussed below and distributions to shareholders required to maintain our reit status 
the company expects to fund any short term liquidity requirements above our operating cash flows through short term borrowings under our line of credit 
the company currently anticipates that full year hotel portfolio revpar  compared to  will be in a range between to 
ffo for is expected to be within the range of to and ebitda is expected to be within the range of million to million 
the company may make additional investments in hotel properties and may incur  or cause the partnership to incur  indebtedness to make such investments or to meet distribution requirements imposed on a reit under the internal revenue code of the code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from the company s investments are insufficient to make such distributions 
the company s board of directors has adopted a policy limiting aggregate indebtedness to of the company s investment in hotel properties  at cost  after giving effect to the company s use of proceeds from any indebtedness 
this policy may be amended at any time by the board of directors without shareholder vote 
the company s consolidated indebtedness was of its investments in hotels  at cost  at december  the following details our debt outstanding at december  in thousands principal balance collateral net book interest of value at rate maturity hotels commercial mortgage bonds class a   fixed class b   fixed class c   fixed line of credit   libor plus variable oct  percentage mortgage   fixed july  mortgage   fixed nov  mortgage   fixed nov  mortgage   fixed nov  mortgage   fixed sept  mortgage   fixed nov  the line of credit has a borrowing capacity of million 
the weighted average interest rate incurred by the company in was 
payment of outstanding indebtedness under the line of credit is due at maturity in october this indebtedness must be refinanced on or before its maturity date 
although the company believes it will be successful in refinancing this obligation prior to maturity  there can be no assurance that conditions will permit the required refinancing  or that refinancing will be available on terms that the company considers to be in the best interest of its shareholders 
if the indebtedness is not refinanced  the company will be in default  and the holder of such indebtedness will be entitled to the remedies provided in the debt instruments 
such an event would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s success in refinancing this indebtedness will be dependent upon a number of factors  including  for example  its operating performance  operating performance of peers in the hospitality industry  general economic and political conditions and the general condition of the capital markets 
on january   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional principal amount of million 
the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the company s floating rate line of credit at a rate of plus      or as determined by the percentage 
the swap agreement will expire in october during  the company invested million to fund capital improvements to its hotels  including replacement of carpets  drapes  renovation of common areas and improvements of hotel exteriors 
in addition  the company expects to fund approximately million in for capital improvements 
the company intends to fund such improvements out of future cash from operations  present cash balances and borrowings under the line of credit 
under certain of its loan covenants  the partnership is obligated to fund of room revenues per quarter on a cumulative basis  to a separate room renovation account for the ongoing replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment at the hotels 
for the years ended december  and  the amounts expended exceeded the amounts required under the loan covenants 
in connection with its acquisition of a hotel in chicago  illinois  the company entered into a contract whereby the final installment of the purchase price for the hotel would be adjusted based on a calculation of capitalized net operating income  as defined in the agreement  for the results of the hotel in either  or the agreement stipulates that the minimum amount to be paid under this agreement by the company to the seller is million and the maximum is million 
the company has obtained a letter of credit in the amount of million related to this agreement 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
for example  for federal income tax purposes  a reit  and therefore the company  is required to pay distributions of at least of its taxable income to its shareholders 
the company intends to pay these distributions from operating cash flows 
during  the partnership distributed an aggregate of million to its partners  or 
per unit including million of distributions to the company to funds distributions to shareholders of

during  the partnership distributed an aggregate of million to its partners  or

for federal income tax purposes  approximately of distributions represented a return of capital  compared with approximately for the company s decision to pay a quarterly common dividend will be determined each quarter based upon the operating results of that quarter  economic conditions  and other operating trends 
the company currently anticipates that it should be able to pay an aggregate of to in dividends per common share during  based on the low end of our current ffo estimates 
the company expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term secured and unsecured borrowings  the issuance of additional equity securities of the company or  in connection with acquisitions of hotel properties  the issuance of partnership units 
under the partnership s limited partnership agreement the partnership agreement  subject to certain holding period requirements  holders of units in the partnership have the right to require the partnership to redeem their units 
during the year ended december    units were tendered for redemption 
under the partnership agreement  the company has the option to redeem units tendered for redemption on a one for one basis for shares of common stock or for an equivalent amount of cash 
the company anticipates that it will acquire any units tendered for redemption in the foreseeable future in exchange for shares of common stock and  to date  has registered such shares so as to be freely tradeable by the recipient 
the company has obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt and operating lease contracts 
the following schedule details these obligations at december  in thousands less than after total year years years years debt      operating leases     other   total contractual obligations      funds from operations the company generally considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of the performance of an equity reit 
in accordance with the resolution adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
for the periods presented  depreciation  gains and losses from sales of property and minority interest were the company s only adjustments to net income for the definition of ffo 
the company s computation of ffo may not be comparable to the nareit definition or to ffo reported by other reits 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or other measurements under generally accepted accounting principles as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments with respect to indebtedness on the hotels 
the following reconciliation of net income to ffo illustrates the difference in the two measures of operating performance for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share and unit data net income    less gain on sale of hotel properties preferred stock dividends    add minority interest depreciation of buildings  furniture and fixtures    loss on sale of hotel properties  funds from operations    add non recurring items provision for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets recurring funds from operations    weighted average number of common shares and units outstanding    inflation operators of hotels in general have the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
however  competitive pressures may limit the company s ability to raise room rates in the face of inflation 
seasonality hotel operations historically are seasonal in nature  generally reflecting higher occupancy rates during the second and third quarters 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements note of the notes to consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards affects the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  the impacts are discussed in the applicable section s of the management s discussion and analysis and the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  all estimates are evaluated by the company s management  including those related to bad debts  carrying value of investments in hotel properties  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
all estimates are based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers and other borrowers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers or other borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company records an impairment charge when it believes an investment in hotels has been impaired such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis of the investment in the hotel property 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company s management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if management determines that the company will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the periods such determination was made 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant of which is the fluctuation in interest rates 
at december   the company s exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates is related solely to its debt outstanding under the line of credit 
total debt outstanding under the line of credit totaled million at december  the company s line of credit bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus     or as determined by the company s percentage of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in the loan agreement the percentage 
at december   the interest rate on the line of credit was libor at december  plus 
the company s interest rate risk objective is to limit the impact of interest rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  the company manages its exposure to fluctuations in market interest rates for its borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt instruments to the extent that reasonably favorable rates are obtainable through such arrangements and derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of its variable rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company regularly reviews interest rate exposure on its outstanding borrowings in an effort to minimize the risk of interest rate fluctuation 
on january   the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a financial institution on a notional principal amount of million 
the agreement effectively fixes the interest rate on the first million of floating rate debt at plus the percentage 
the swap agreement will expire in november thus  at december   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding under the line of credit that was exposed to fluctuations in the market rate of interest 
the company s line of credit matures in october of as discussed above  the company s line of credit bears interest at variable rates  and therefore  cost approximates market value 
as of december   the fair value liability of the company s interest rate swap was approximately million 
the company s operating results are affected by changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of its borrowings under the line of credit 
if interest rates increased by basis points  the company s interest expense would have increased by approximately  based on balances outstanding during the year ended december
