management believes the company has gained substantial expertise in understanding and serving the particular needs of the medicaid population 
industry in an effort to control costs while assuring the delivery of quality health care services  the public and private sectors have increasingly turned to managed care solutions 
as a result  the managed care industry  which includes health maintenance organization hmo  preferred provider organization ppo and prepaid health service plans  has grown substantially 
while the trend toward managed care solutions has traditionally been pursued most aggressively by the private sector  the public sector has embraced the trend in an effort to control the costs of health care provided to medicaid recipients

fees paid to the company were changed  however  to a cost based fee  by amendment dated december  and effective august  managed plan owned by the company omnicare tn 
omnicare tn was organized as a tennessee corporation in october  and is headquartered in memphis  tennessee 
the company was active in the development of omnicare tn  and through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  united american of tennessee  inc  owns a equity interest in omnicare tn  a local partner owns the remaining 
omnicare tn began as a ppo contractor with the bureau of tenncare  a state of tennessee program that provides medical benefits to medicaid and working uninsured and uninsurable recipients  and operated as a full risk prepaid health services plan until it obtained its tenncare hmo license in march omnicare tn s tenncare hmo contract was executed in october  retroactive to the date of licensure 
in november  omnicare tn contracted with the state of tennessee  doing business as tenncare tenncare  as a medicaid ppo to arrange for the financing and delivery of health care services on a capitated basis to eligible medicaid beneficiaries and the working uninsured and uninsurable non medicaid individuals who lack access to private or employer sponsored health insurance or to another government health plan 
tenncare placed an indefinite moratorium on working uninsured enrollment in december  however  such action did not affect persons enrolled in a plan prior to the moratorium 
in april  enrollment was expanded to include the children of the working uninsured up to age the contract between omnicare tn and tenncare was renewed july  for a month term  expiring december  the new contract provided for increased capitation rates  but eliminated the practice of providing retroactive payments to managed care organizations for high cost chronic conditions of their members adverse selection and payments earmarked as adjustments for covered benefits 
omnicare tn was assigned approximately  members by tenncare in the second half of fiscal as a result of three other managed care organizations  which had contracts with tenncare  ceasing to serve their enrollees or being unable to take on new enrollees 
medical services expenses for such new omnicare tn members disproportionately exceeded omnicare tn s normal per member per month pmpm experience and adversely affected its earnings for and since that period 
omnicare tn received from tenncare in fiscal an adverse selection payment of million for such fiscal expenses 
in june  tenncare developed new risk sharing options for its participating managed care organizations mcos  including omnicare tn 
omnicare tn entered into its changed contract with tenncare effective july  at june   omnicare tn was licensed in and served shelby and davidson counties in tennessee which include the cities of memphis and nashville  respectively 
effective july   omnicare tn received approval from tenncare to expand its service area to western tennessee and to withdraw from davidson county 
additionally  a significant competitor of omnicare tn ceased doing business in october  and tenncare assigned approximately  of that plan s members to omnicare tn on february  beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including omnicare tn 
during that period  mcos are generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earn fixed administrative fees  are not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors  are subject to increased oversight  and may incur financial penalties for not achieving certain performance requirements 
the program was initially designed to permit mcos also to earn limited additional administrative fees based on certain performance measures as an incentive to manage medical costs below the targets  but that component of the program was subsequently omitted in practice 
omnicare tn sought reimbursement from tenncare for exceptionally high medical expenses incurred by new omnicare tn enrollees in fiscal year  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to omnicare tn 
in response  tenncare amended its contract with omnicare tn in september  retroactive to july  in some respects and to may  in other respects 
the amendment states that omnicare tn s outside actuary certified the plan required million to meet its statutory net worth requirement for the year ended june  and that omnicare tn is a viable hmo under contract with tenncare on the same basis as other comparable hmos in the program effective july  pursuant to such contractual amendment omnicare tn retroactively elected an available risk option for the ten months from july  through april   tenncare retroactively agreed to reimburse omnicare tn on a no risk aso basis for medical services effective beginning may   and tenncare agreed to pay omnicare tn up to million as necessary to meet its statutory net worth requirement as of june  pursuant to an agreement between tenncare and omnicare tn in october  tenncare further agreed to pay additional funds to omnicare tn if future certified actuarial data confirm they are needed by omnicare tn to meet that requirement 
under generally accepted accounting principles  the million receivable was not recorded in fiscal financial statements but has been recorded in fiscal financial statements 
based on an actuarial determination  an additional million of fiscal medical claims liability was recorded during fiscal in all  fiscal medical claims of million were processed in the fiscal year ended june   and the same aggregate amount was recognized as revenue by omnicare tn 
omnicare tn s application for a commercial hmo license was approved on september  management is not yet actively pursuing that commercial business  however  due to omnicare tn s substantially increased enrollment from members tenncare assigned from defunct other plans 
as of september   omnicare tn s total enrollment was  members  of whom were medicaid enrollees and were non medicaid enrollees 
managed plan operated by the company omnicare mi 
as further described below  omnicare mi ceased to be a managed plan operated by the company effective november  omnicare mi is a not for profit  tax exempt corporation headquartered in detroit  michigan and serving southeastern michigan  operating in wayne  oakland  macomb  monroe and washtenaw counties 
its history includes a number of innovations that were adopted and proved successful for the industry 
while managed by the company  it was the first network model hmo in the country and the first to capitate physician services in an ipa model hmo an independent practice association model hmo does not employ physicians as staff  but instead contracts with associations or groups of independent physicians to provide services to hmo members 
omnicare mi also created and implemented the first known mental health capitation carve out in while managed by the company  omnicare mi s enrollment was through companies that offered the health plan coverage to employees and their family members  through individual enrollment and through the state of michigan s medicaid program pursuant to an agreement with the michigan department of community health  which made hmo coverage available to eligible medicaid beneficiaries in certain counties and mandatory in others 
on april   the company funded an unsecured loan to omnicare mi evidenced by a surplus note of million to enable omnicare mi to meet its minimum statutory requirement for net worth and working capital 
the loan consisted of million in cash and conversion of million of management fees owed to the company 
pursuant to the terms of the surplus note  interest and principal payments required approval by the michigan office of financial and insurance services and were repayable only from any statutory surplus earnings of omnicare mi 
note interest was payable annually and forfeited if not then paid 
interest income of million and million on that and a similar earlier surplus note was forfeited for fiscal years and  respectively 
the note principal had no stated maturity or repayment date 
the surplus notes were subordinated to all other claimants of omnicare mi 
based on an analysis of omnicare mi s projected cash flows  the company recorded impairment losses on the valuation of the surplus notes which resulted in bad debt expense of million for the year ended june  on july   claims of all creditors holding surplus notes from omnicare mi were permanently disallowed by the state circuit court order which approved omnicare mi s amended rehabilitation plan 
on may   approximately  members of the detroit medical center s medicaid managed care program were transferred to omnicare mi 
the additional membership generated management fee revenue of million in fiscal year as a michigan hmo  omnicare mi is subject to oversight by the state of michigan s commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services the commissioner 
on july   pursuant to a motion by the commissioner  a state circuit court judge entered an order of rehabilitation of omnicare mi the order and appointed the commissioner as rehabilitator of omnicare mi 
the order directed the rehabilitator to administer all of omnicare mi s assets and business while attempting to effectuate its rehabilitation  preserve its provider network and maintain uninterrupted health care services to the greatest extent possible 
the order required the company to continue performing all services under its omnicare mi management agreement  which the company did until that agreement s termination on november   pursuant to omnicare mi s court approved rehabilitation plan 
the omnicare mi management agreement was amended december   effective august  the amendment reduced the company s management fee revenues from omnicare mi beginning august   by changing the methodology for determining the company s management fee from a fixed percentage of premiums earned by omnicare mi to a cost based fee  which was equivalent to approximately of premiums earned beginning in august  subject to adjustment to appropriately reflect the company s actual costs of performing the management agreement 
the amendment continued unchanged the other basic terms of the company s management agreement with omnicare mi as summarized in table a under managed plans above 
government regulation the company is and or has been subject to extensive federal and state health care and insurance regulations designed primarily to protect enrollees in the managed plans  particularly with respect to government sponsored enrollees 
such regulations govern many aspects of the company s business affairs and typically empower state agencies to review management agreements with health care plans for  among other things  reasonableness of charges 
among the other areas regulated by federal and state law are licensure requirements  premium rate increases  new product offerings  procedures for quality assurance  enrollment requirements  covered benefits  service area expansion  provider relationships and the financial condition of the managed plans  including cash reserve requirements and dividend restrictions 
there can be no assurances that the company or omnicare tn will be granted the necessary approvals for new products or will maintain federal qualifications or state licensure 
the licensing and operation of omnicare tn are governed by the tennessee statutes and regulations applicable to health maintenance organizations 
the licenses are subject to denial  limitation  suspension or revocation if there is a determination that the plan is operating out of compliance with the state s hmo statute  failing to provide quality health services  establishing rates that are unfair or unreasonable  failing to fulfill obligations under outstanding agreements or operating on an unsound fiscal basis 
omnicare tn is not a federally qualified hmo and  therefore  is not subject to the federal hmo act 
federal and state regulation of health care plans and managed care products is subject to frequent change  varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and generally gives responsible administrative agencies broad discretion 
laws and regulations relating to the company s business are subject to amendment and or interpretation in each jurisdiction 
in particular  legislation mandating managed care for medicaid recipients is often subject to change and may not initially be accompanied by administrative rules and guidelines 
changes in federal or state governmental regulation could affect the company s operations  profitability and business prospects 
while the company is unable to predict what additional government regulations  if any  affecting its business may be enacted in the future or how existing or future regulations may be interpreted  regulatory revisions may have a material adverse effect on the company 
insurance the company presently carries comprehensive general liability  directors and officers liability  property  business automobile  and workers compensation insurance 
management believes that coverage levels under these policies are adequate in view of the risks associated with the company s business 
in addition  the managed plans including omnicare mi while managed by the company have professional liability insurance that covers liability claims arising from medical malpractice 
omnicare tn is required to pay the insurance premiums under the terms of the company s management agreement 
there can be no assurance as to the future availability or cost of such insurance  or that the company s business risks will be maintained within the limits of such insurance coverage 
competition the managed care industry is highly competitive 
the company directly competes with other entities that provide health care plan management services  some of which are nonprofit corporations and others which have significantly greater financial and administrative resources 
the company primarily competes on the basis of fee arrangements  cost effectiveness and the range and quality of services offered to prospective health care clients 
while the company believes that its experience gives it certain competitive advantages over existing and potential new competitors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete effectively in the future 
the company competes with other hmos  ppos and insurance companies 
the level of this competition may affect  among other things  the operating revenues of omnicare tn and  therefore  the revenues of the company 
omnicare tn s primary market competitors in western tennessee are tlc  better health plans and tenncare select 
omnicare tn primarily competes on the basis of enrollments  provider networks and other related plan features and criteria 
management believes that omnicare tn is able to compete effectively with its primary market competitors 
employees the company s ability to maintain its competitive position and expand its business into new markets depends  in significant part  upon the maintenance of its relationships with various existing senior officers  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified health care management professionals 
the company neither has nor intends to pursue any long term employment agreement with any of its key personnel 
accordingly  there is no assurance that the company will be able to maintain such relationships or attract such professionals 
the total number of employees at september  was compared to at october  the company s employees do not belong to a collective bargaining unit and management considers its relations with employees to be good 
the above stated total number of employees at september  decreased by at november  in connection with the termination of its omnicare mi management agreement  when omnicare mi commenced employing most of the company employees excluding officers who provide services for omnicare mi 
the company gave termination notices  effective november   to its employees who provided services for omnicare mi but whom omnicare mi did not employ  and the company had no severance payment obligations to any of those employees

the company provides comprehensive management and consulting services to managed care organizations  including health maintenance organizations hmos in tennessee and until november  michigan  with a targeted mix of medicaid and commercial enrollment 
omnicare health plan  in michigan omnicare mi  an hmo then administered by the company under a management agreement  was placed in court ordered rehabilitation proceedings on july   which relieved the company from further funding omnicare mi s capital deficiencies and which continued its omnicare mi management agreement  with substantially reduced management fee revenues from omnicare mi beginning august  in march  upon the court appointed rehabilitator s filing a proposed rehabilitation plan for omnicare mi  the company announced it anticipated eventual termination of the management agreement 
such termination occurred november   after which the company s only managed plan has been omnicare health plan  inc  in tennessee omnicare tn  an hmo which is owned by the company s wholly owned subsidiary 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements in this annual report have been restated to present the operations related to managing omnicare mi as a discontinued operation 
beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including omnicare tn 
during that period  mcos are generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earn fixed administrative fees  are not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors and are subject to increased oversight 
these matters are more fully discussed and analyzed below under the heading review of consolidated results of operations compared to the following are earlier events which notably affected results of operations for fiscal years covered by the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in september  effective august   chf was sold for million  comprised of cash and million in buyer s notes 
on august   the company was paid million  the remaining principal balance of the notes and accrued interest  net of a million discount to induce the buyer to prepay the notes 
all proceeds were used to reduce the company s bank indebtedness 
pursuant to a stock repurchase plan of the company s board of directors   company common shares were repurchased in the open market and retired in july on april   the company funded an unsecured loan to omnicare mi evidenced by a surplus note of million to enable omnicare mi to meet its minimum statutory requirement for net worth and working capital 
the loan consisted of million in cash and conversion of million of management fees owed to the company 
pursuant to the terms of the surplus note  interest and principal payments required approval by the michigan office of financial and insurance services and were repayable only from any statutory surplus earnings of omnicare mi 
note interest was payable annually and forfeited if not then paid 
interest income of million and million on that and a similar earlier surplus note was forfeited for fiscal years and  respectively 
the note principal had no stated maturity or repayment date 
the surplus notes were subordinated to all other claimants of omnicare mi 
based on an analysis of omnicare mi s projected cash flows  the company recorded impairment losses on the valuation of the surplus notes which resulted in bad debt expense of million for the year ended june  on july   claims of all creditors holding surplus notes from omnicare mi were permanently disallowed by the state circuit court order which approved omnicare mi s amended rehabilitation plan 
on july   the state of michigan notified omnicare mi it was a successful bidder in the bid process for increased medicaid rates and continued eligibility as an hmo providing coverage to enrollees of the state s comprehensive health care program for medicaid beneficiaries 
omnicare mi accordingly was awarded a rate increase and extension of its contract with the state 
in april  a florida health care administration agency notified the company of intent to enforce its agreement to reimburse ultramedix s contracted medicaid providers for certain services which the agency had paid for on enrollees behalf  limited to the amount of surplus ultramedix would have had to maintain under the medicaid contract absent such agreement 
the company established at december  a million estimated medical claims reserve for ultramedix and maintained it until march   when the company concluded the continuing reserve requirement should be million  and therefore reduced the million reserve by million and offset that amount against medical services expenses 
at march   the company eliminated the remaining reserve of million 
in fiscal  based on an evaluation of the net recoverable value of the company s investment in philcare  a pennsylvania hmo that was owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  the company recorded a full impairment loss against its million investment 
philcare was dissolved in fiscal philcare assets were then distributed to such subsidiary pursuant to agreements under which it contributed those assets  and the company recovered its million investment in philcare  resulting in a gain in that amount for fiscal effective july   omnicare tn entered into a new month contract with the state of tennessee s tenncare program 
the contract provided for an approximate increase in average premiums effective july  and a further increase effective july   with future increases to be determined by the state of tennessee 
such increases were in lieu of the quarterly adverse selection payments previously made by tenncare to compensate managed care organizations for substantial adverse costs incurred due to the nature of the services they offer and their treatment of a high risk population 
on september   the company made an additional cash contribution of million to omnicare tn in exchange for additional preferred stock of omnicare tn 
the cash contribution was made to enable omnicare tn to meet minimum statutory requirements for net worth 
review of consolidated results of operations compared to omnicare tn developments it should be noted initially in this discussion that fiscal was a year of significant changes for omnicare tn and the other managed care organizations mcos having contracts with tenncare  a state of tennessee program that provides medical benefits to medicaid and working uninsured and uninsurable recipients 
in a climate of continually rising medical costs  several of tenncare s major mcos ceased doing business in fiscal in contrast  tenncare has expressly regarded omnicare tn as one of tenncare s viable mcos 
omnicare tn experienced a combination of circumstances in the fourth quarter of fiscal which were unexpected and not foreseeable by management 
beginning in february  march and april  omnicare tn noticed increases in its claims payments  investigated  and found that approximately  new members added in september december represented children with special needs with medical costs over of the premiums received  and that many members transferred to omnicare tn from failed mcos also had medical costs in excess of omnicare tn s premiums received 
beginning in april  omnicare tn wrote to tenncare seeking risk adjustments and reimbursements to compensate omnicare tn for such medical expenses  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to omnicare tn 
tenncare responded to its mcos situation generally and in some instances individually 
for all its contracted mcos generally  tenncare changed its reimbursement system to an administrative services only aso program for an month stabilization period july  through december   during which the mcos including omnicare tn have no medical cost risk ie  no risk for medical losses  earn fixed administrative fees and are subject to increased oversight 
under such aso program as originally established  the company expected to earn limited additional administrative fees  based on certain performance measures as an incentive to manage medical costs below the targets 
however  the governor of tennessee and tenncare representatives later publicly stated in discussions with the tennessee legislature and elsewhere that no incentive payments would be made because of that state s and tenncare s budget situation 
tenncare stated at the inception of the aso program that it intends to return to a full risk system after the end of the month stabilization period at january  this remains the company s current understanding of tenncare s intention in this regard 
tenncare responded to omnicare tn s situation individually as well 
in september  omnicare tn and the state of tennessee  doing business as tenncare  amended the contractor risk agreement between them 
pursuant to the amendment retroactively effective july  through april   omnicare tn elected to operate under a shared risk arrangement  under which gains or losses are shared with the state of tennessee  retroactively effective beginning may   omnicare tn is reimbursed under an administrative services only agreement with no risk of medical loss  and the state of tennessee agreed to pay omnicare tn up to million as necessary to meet its statutory net worth requirement as of june  pursuant to a further agreement with omnicare tn in october  the state of tennessee agreed to pay additional funds to omnicare tn if future certified actuarial data confirm they are needed by omnicare tn to meet its statutory net worth requirement as of june  under generally accepted accounting principles  such million was not recorded in the company s fiscal financial statements but has been recorded in its fiscal financial statements as fiscal claims were processed 
based on an actuarial determination  an additional million of fiscal medical claims liability was recorded during fiscal in all  fiscal medical claims of million were processed  in the fiscal year ended june   and the aggregate amount was recognized as revenue by omnicare tn 
beginning july  tenncare disenrolled approximately  enrollees statewide in an eligibility reverification process 
in december  a us district court judge in tennessee ruled that such process was flawed 
in march  tenncare and tennessee governor phil bredesan announced that all disenrolled members will have a year long grace period until march  to prove if they actually meet the eligibility requirements and thereby have their wrongful disenrollment cancelled and their enrollment restored retroactively 
omnicare tn expects re enrollment  in some instances retroactively to july   of some of its approximately  affected working uninsured or uninsurable members 
as of june   omnicare tn s total enrollment was  members  compared to  at october  the increase in members is attributed to the assignment of  members by tenncare on june  offset by the loss of approximately  members as discussed in the previous paragraph 
omnicare mi developments it should be noted initially in this discussion that the company s longstanding management agreement with omnicare mi ended effective november  the consolidated financial statements have been restated to present the operations related to managing omnicare mi as a discontinued operation 
as a michigan hmo  omnicare mi is subject to oversight by the state of michigan s commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services the commissioner 
on july   pursuant to a motion by the commissioner  a state circuit court judge entered an order of rehabilitation of omnicare mi the order and appointed the commissioner as rehabilitator of omnicare mi 
the order directed the rehabilitator to administer all of omnicare mi s assets and business while attempting to effectuate its rehabilitation  preserve its provider network and maintain uninterrupted health care services to the greatest extent possible 
pursuant to and since the order  through the management agreement s termination date  the rehabilitator s appointed special deputy served as the chief executive officer of omnicare mi 
the omnicare mi management agreement was amended on december   effective august  the second month of fiscal 
pursuant to the amendment  omnicare mi paid all of its own expenses commencing as of august   except for personnel  rent and depreciation  which the company continued to pay 
the amendment reduced the company s management fee revenues from omnicare mi beginning august   by changing the methodology for determining the management fee from a fixed percentage of premiums earned by omnicare mi to a cost based fee  which was equivalent to approximately of premiums earned beginning in august  subject to adjustment to reflect the company s actual costs of performing the management agreement 
the order beneficially relieved the company from further funding omnicare mi s capital deficiencies through unsecured loans and forgiving earned management fees 
the order required the company to continue performing all services under its omnicare mi management agreement  which continued through october  that agreement terminated november  pursuant to notice received from omnicare mi in accordance with its amended rehabilitation plan  which a state circuit court judge approved on july  because of its resulting workforce reduction  the company made plans to sublease all of its then principal office premises in detroit  michigan  to omnicare mi  retroactive to november   and expiring at the lease end in may  and to sell to omnicare mi furniture  a telephone system and certain computer hardware and software that the company chose to leave there 
management had expected both parties to finalize and sign the sublease  and close the sale of such assets  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  but that has been delayed due to the unique circumstance explained in the next paragraph below 
omnicare mi commenced its occupancy of the premises on november  and the company remained in a portion of the premises until it moved its principal offices to new leased premises in detroit on february  on april   the governor of michigan appointed linda a 
watters as the new commissioner of the office of financial and insurance services 
ms 
watters had served on the company s board of directors continually since and resigned that office on the same date she became the new commissioner as required to avoid any possible appearance of a conflict of interest and not as the result of any disagreement with the company 
because of the new commissioner s prior association with the company  the state circuit court judge who retained jurisdiction over omnicare mi s rehabilitation proceedings then required that a designated independent person replace the rehabilitator s ie  commissioner s special deputy who had been dealing with the sublease and assets purchase  which personnel change on omnicare mi s part accounts for the delay in signing the sublease and closing the assets sale 
management now expects to complete the signing of the sublease and the sale of assets in the next several months 
in connection with the november  termination of its omnicare mi management agreement  the company recorded a million loss from discontinued operations in the second quarter of fiscal such loss was due in part to i a million write down of assets held for sale in excess of the anticipated selling price for the pending sale of assets described above  ii the above described sublease  which is expected to cost the company approximately million per month through the remainder of the lease  ending in may  resulting in a loss of million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal  which was offset by a million write down of a deferred rent liability associated with the original lease  and iii a bad debt charge of million recorded because management determined the collectability of that amount of receivables from omnicare mi is doubtful 
the recorded charges discussed above were offset by management fees from omnicare mi of million

member months increased  to  in the fiscal year ended june  from  in the fiscal year ended june   and accounted for a million increase in omnicare tn s medical premium revenues 
the total omnicare tn per member per month pmpm revenue rate based on an average membership of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  was pmpm for the fiscal year ended june  compared to pmpm for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of pmpm  which accounted for a decrease of million in omnicare tn s medical premium revenues

medical services expenses for county care were million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million from medical services expenses of million in the fiscal year ended june  the county care mlr for the fiscal year ended june  was compared to for the fiscal year ended june  county care operations began with inception of the contract in april and ceased  at the company s election  upon the contract s september  expiration

depreciation and amortization decreased million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june  interest expense decreased million to million in the fiscal year ended june  from million in the fiscal year ended june   due to bank debt reduction of million and a two percentage points decrease in the prime rate for the majority of fiscal year the company recognized a loss from discontinued operations of million in the fiscal year ended june  compared to a loss from discontinued operations of million in the fiscal year ended june  as the result of the termination of the company s longstanding management agreement with omnicare mi  effective november  the loss in fiscal year is primarily attributed to an impairment loss equal to the million remaining carrying value of the patient care software system which the company had purchased to fulfill a requirement of the state of michigan s office of financial and insurance services to implement such a system for omnicare mi 
the system was not in use at june  and company management recognized that the system would not be used by omnicare mi because its management agreement with the company would terminate november  the company recognized a loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million for the year ended june  compared to earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of million for the year ended june  the net loss for the year ended june  was million  or per share  compared to net earnings of million  or per share  for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources at june   the company had i cash and cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of million  compared to million at june   ii positive working capital of million  compared to negative working capital of million at june   and iii a current assets to current liabilities ratio of to  compared to to at june  net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal investing activities in fiscal included the purchase of equipment of million and the purchase of marketable securities of million  offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of marketable securities of million 
debt repayments were million in fiscal cash and marketable securities decreased by million at june  compared to june   due primarily to operating needs of million and debt repayments of million 
accounts receivable decreased by million at june  compared to june   primarily because of tenncare s new aso reimbursement system referred to above 
property  plant and equipment decreased by million at june  compared to june   due an impairment charge associated with a pending sale of certain furniture  equipment and software and the recording of depreciation of million 
medical claims payable decreased by million at june  compared to june   which is directly related to the payment of omnicare tn fiscal medical claims processed during the period  and tenncare s new aso reimbursement system 
omnicare tn sought reimbursement from tenncare for exceptionally high medical expenses incurred by new omnicare tn enrollees in fiscal year  including for actuarially estimated claims incurred but not yet reported to omnicare tn 
in response  tenncare amended its contract with omnicare tn in september  retroactive to july  in some respects and to may  in other respects 
the amendment states that omnicare tn s outside actuary certified the plan required million to meet its statutory net worth requirement for the year ended june  and that omnicare tn is a viable hmo under contract with tenncare on the same basis as other comparable hmos in the program effective july  omnicare tn received a permitted practice letter from the state of tennessee to include such million receivable in its statutory net worth at june  pursuant to an agreement between tenncare and omnicare tn in october  tenncare further agreed to pay additional funds to omnicare tn if future certified actuarial data confirm they are needed by omnicare tn to meet its statutory net worth requirement as of june  under generally accepted accounting principles  the million receivable was not recorded in fiscal financial statements but has been recorded in fiscal financial statements 
based on an actuarial determination  an additional million of fiscal medical claims liability was recorded during fiscal in all  fiscal medical claims of million were processed in the fiscal year ended june   and the same aggregate amount was recognized as revenue by omnicare tn 
omnicare tn s application for a commercial hmo license was approved on september  management is not yet actively pursuing that commercial business  however  due to omnicare tn s substantially increased enrollment from members tenncare assigned from defunct other plans  together with adapting to tenncare s month stabilization program 
beginning july   tenncare implemented an month stabilization program which entailed changes to tenncare s contracts with mcos  including omnicare tn 
during that period  mcos are generally compensated for administrative services only commonly called aso  earn fixed administrative fees  are not at risk for medical costs in excess of targets established based on various factors  are subject to increased oversight  and may incur financial penalties for not achieving certain performance requirements 
under such aso program as originally established  the company expected to earn limited additional administrative fees  based on certain performance measures as an incentive to manage medical costs below the targets 
however  the governor of tennessee and tenncare representatives later publicly stated in discussions with the tennessee legislature and elsewhere that no incentive payments would be made because of that state s and tenncare s budget situation 
tenncare stated at the inception of the aso program that it intends to return to a full risk system after the end of the month stabilization period at january  this remains the company s current understanding of tenncare s intention in this regard 
the company has arranged for a sublease to omnicare mi of all of the company s leased premises in detroit  michigan  retroactive to november  and expiring at the end of the lease in may this arrangement will cost the company approximately  per month through the remainder of the lease 
the company currently has a million term loan with standard federal bank  na repayable in monthly installments of principal and interest of million  with an interest rate equal to the bank s prime rate at june  plus one percent per annum  and a maturity date of september  the loan agreement is collateralized by a security interest in all of the company s personal property 
the company s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its future cash needs depends on a number of factors  particularly including its ability to control administrative costs  related to the aso arrangement for the tenncare program and controlling corporate overhead costs 
on the basis of the matters discussed above  management believes at this time that the company has the ability to generate sufficient cash to adequately support its financial requirements through the next twelve months  maintain compliance with bank financial covenants  and maintain minimum statutory net worth requirements of omnicare tn
