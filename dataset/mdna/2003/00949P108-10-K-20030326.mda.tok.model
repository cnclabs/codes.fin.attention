overview all of the operations of airtran holdings  inc are conducted by our wholly owned subsidiary  airtran airways  inc  which is the second largest affordable fare scheduled airline in the united states in terms of departures 
we offer scheduled airline service principally serving short haul markets  primarily from our hub at hartsfield atlanta international airport in atlanta  georgia 
as of march  we operated aircraft making approximately flights per day serving cities throughout the eastern united states 
we have created a successful niche in selected markets by targeting price sensitive business and leisure travelers 
in addition to offering an affordable fare alternative to higher priced airlines  we believe we contribute toward the overall growth of the markets we serve by stimulating demand among travelers who may otherwise utilize ground transportation or not travel at all 
our service is intended not only to satisfy the transportation needs of our target customers  but also to provide customers with a travel experience worth repeating 
the success of this strategy is evidenced by the million revenue passengers we carried in the year ended december   a percent increase from the million revenue passengers we carried in the prior year ended december  with this traffic and revenue base  our operating margins  excluding special items  rank among the highest in the domestic airline industry 
we achieved this result with a cost structure that ranks among the best in the indus try in terms of cost per available seat mile 
year in review in  we achieved a number of significant accomplishments during what continues to be one of the most challenging periods in the commercial airline industry 
while the industry recorded significant losses in  we earned net income of million 
we achieved these results in an operational and financial environment characterized by significant increases in aviation insurance costs  increased passenger screening costs resulting from evolving security laws and procedures  escalating fuel prices  and  in general  a recessionary domestic economic environment 
we have undertaken a number of key initiatives to strengthen our competitive position  including a fleet renewal plan 
we are in the final stages of replacing and upgrading our aircraft fleet through the acquisition of boeing s b  of which we operated as of december   and to be delivered during we were the launch customer for the b  which was designed specifically for efficient short haul service and is considered among the most modern  innovative  comfortable and environmentally friendly commercial aircraft available today 
concurrently  we are retiring the last of our fleet of mcdonnell douglas dc dc aircraft in we believe the conversion to the bs will continue to enhance our overall image and improve our operating performance 
we also offer amenities such as a business class  assigned seating  a frequent flier program  same concourse connections at hartsfield atlanta international airport and full participation in travel agents computer reservations 
other highlights from include the following inauguration of service to five new destinations  including kansas city  mo  milwaukee  wi  rochester  ny  west palm beach  fl  and wichita  ks 
launch of airtran jetconnect tm  a new regional jet service 
commencement of construction on our million   square foot hangar at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
transacted more than percent of our bookings via the internet 
upgraded features on airtran 
com including seat assignments on select fares 
looking forward to  we expect operating revenues to grow as we increase available seat mile asm capacity by more than percent 
by the end of the year we anticipate operating a single aircraft type as we retire the remaining aircraft in our dc fleet 
with the operation of a single aircraft type we expect to improve our cost advantage over our competitors  primarily in the areas of maintenance  fuel consumption  spare parts provisioning  simplified scheduling  and lower training costs 
many of our competitors have experienced significant financial and operational hardships  including bankruptcy protection and capacity reductions 
as these competitors downsize their operations  market opportunities may become available 
we intend to follow a controlled growth plan that includes i diversification of our route network to balance our predominantly north south route network with more east west service  ii adding additional frequencies on existing routes to provide our customers with more convenient schedules from which to choose  and iii utilizing our aircraft more efficiently  leveraging advances in technology  and carefully hiring and training our personnel  all of which improve productivity and increase our cost advantage over our competitors 
although we were able to generally offset the increased level of operating expenses in with lower maintenance and distribution costs  there can be no assurance we will be able to continue to offset any additional expenses  particularly resulting from increases in the price of fuel  further changes to security procedures or increases in aircraft insurance costs 
results of operations compared to summary for the year we recorded operating income of million  net income of million and diluted earnings per common share of 
these results reflect a credit of million for government grant funds received pursuant to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act the stabilization act 
our diluted earnings per common share were increased by upon recognition of the government grant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for the comparative period in  including special items  we recorded operating income of million  a net loss of million and a diluted loss per common share of 
our results were significantly affected by the terrorist attacks on the united states that occurred on september  the september events and include i special charges of million in operating expenses that reflect reductions in aircraft fleet values  aircraft lease termination charges  ii special charges of million directly rel ated to the september events  and iii a credit of million for government grant funds we expected to receive pursuant to the stabilization act 
our nonoperating results for included a special item of million representing additional debt discount amortization resulting from the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our convertible notes 
our diluted earnings per common share for the year ended december  were increased by upon recognition of the government grant see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our passenger revenues for the period from september through december were significantly affected by the september events 
in response to the terrorist attacks  the federal aviation administration faa immediately issued a federal ground stop order on september th  which prohibited all civil aviation flights from operation within the national airspace of the united states 
the us airspace was not reopened until september th  at which time we operated a portion of our pre september th scheduled operations 
once flights resumed  passenger traffic and yields were significantly lower than we had experienced prior to september th 
in an effort to match our capacity to the reduced level of demand  we reduced our operations to levels similar to those we operated during the same period in  despite the fact that we had been successful in growing our capacity by percent earlier in the year 
in addition  many corporations curtailed their business travel and leisure travelers cancelled or postponed vacations  which forced airlines to reduce airfares in an attempt to stimulate demand 
despite these actions  our traffic dropped in the post september th period by over percent  which resulted in our passenger load factor declining eight percentage points compared to the previous year 
passenger yields also suffered during the post september th period declining nearly percent year over year 
this resulted in a million  or percent  decline in passenger revenues compared to the same time period in on september   president bush signed into law the stabilization act  which provided  in part  for qualifying us airlines and air cargo carriers to receive up to billion in compensation for direct losses  including lost revenues  incurred as a direct result of the faa ground stop order and for incremental losses incurred through december  as a direct result of the september events  up to billion in federal government loan guarantees  reimbursement for certain insurance increases  and the extension in due dates for payment of certain excise taxes 
each air carrier was entitled to receive the lesser of its direct and incremental losses for the period of september  to december  or its available seat mile asm allocation of the billion compensation 
we received compensation payments of million and million during and  respectively 
related to these payments  we recognized income of million and million in and  respectively  which is included in operating expenses government grant on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we believe excluding the impact of the aforementioned special items may enhance comparative analysis of our results 
the following table reconciles results reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap with results adjusted to exclude our special items for the year ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income loss  as reported reduction of b and dc fleet values and lease termination charges see note september th special charges see note debt discount amortization see note government grant see note adjusted net income  excluding special items non gaap net income loss per share  basic  as reported reduction of b and dc fleet values and lease termination charges see note september th special charges see note debt discount amortization see note government grant see note adjusted net income per share  basic  excluding special items non gaap net income loss per share  diluted  as reported reduction of b and dc fleet values and lease termination charges see note september th special charges see note debt discount amortization see note government grant see note adjusted net income per share  diluted  excluding special items non gaap operating revenues our operating revenues for the year increased million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
the increase in passenger revenues was primarily due to a percent increase in traffic  as measured by revenue passenger miles rpms 
during  we took delivery of boeing aircraft and retired dc aircraft 
as a result  our capacity  as measured by asms  increased by percent 
when coupled with our rpm growth of percent  our load factor declined percentage points to percent 
although we continued to grow our operations by adding new aircraft to our fleet  new destinations to our route network  and additional frequencies between existing city pairs  the general erosion of yields and passenger load factors that began in the third quarter of continued to unfavorably affect our passenger revenues during our average yield  as measured by revenue per passenger seat mile  decreased percent to cents per rpm 
the reduction in yield resulted from a percent decrease in our average fare to and a percent increase in our average passenger trip length  as measured by rpms divided by revenue passengers  to miles 
this decline in yield  when combined with our percentage point decline in passenger load factor  resulted in a percent decline in passenger unit revenues  or passenger rasm  to cents per asm 
cargo revenues declined million primarily due to reduced levels of mail transported for the us postal service 
in general  the demand for short haul cargo transportation has diminished following the september events and we have alternatively focused our resources on passenger transportation 
operating expenses our operating expenses for the year increased million percent  including special items  on an asm increase of percent 
operating expenses for reflect a credit of million representing the final installment of government grant funds received pursuant to the stabilization act 
operating expenses for reflect i an impairment charge of million related to the write down of the net book value of our owned b fleet and for charges related to the termination of the lease on one b aircraft  ii special charges of million related to the impairment of our owned dc aircraft fleet and million of other costs directly related to the september events  and iii special gains of million representing the amount of government grant funds we expected to receive pursuant to the stabilization act 
excluding special items  our operating cost per asm casm improved percent to cents on asm growth of percent 
in general  our operating expenses are significantly affected by changes in our capacity  as measured by asms 
the following table presents our unit costs  or operating expenses per asm  for and year ended december  percent change salaries  wages and benefits aircraft fuel aircraft rent distribution maintenance  materials and repairs landing fees and other rents aircraft insurance and security services marketing and advertising depreciation other operating total casm note amounts for exclude a government grant of million on a casm basis 
amounts for exclude impairment loss lease termination  special charges and a government grant of million  million  and million  respectively on a casm basis 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to the addition of flight crews and ground support personnel hired to operate and support the growth of our b aircraft fleet and new destinations added to our route system  as well as contractual wage increases and higher costs associated with our employee benefit programs 
we employed approximately  employees including approximately  full time equivalents at year end representing roughly a percent increase over the comparative period 
aircraft fuel  including fuel hedging activities  increased million percent overall  and improved percent on a casm basis 
in  we consumed percent more fuel primarily due to the growth of our operations 
decreases in the price of aircraft fuel purchases and improvements to our fuel consumption per block hour partially offset our greater fuel consumption 
our average per gallon cost of fuel  including all fees  taxes  and hedging activities decreased percent to cents 
our fuel consumption improved percent decreasing to gallons per block hour 
we continue to realize savings from reduced fuel consumption per block hour as we replace the dc aircraft in our operating fleet with b aircraft that are more fuel efficient 
we expect to derive additional fuel consumption per block hour improvements in as we retire the remaining dc aircraft and operate an all boeing aircraft fleet by the end of the year 
the results of our hedging activities increased aircraft fuel expense by million and million during and  respectively 
aircraft rent increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis due to a greater percentage of our aircraft fleet being leased 
twenty lease financed b aircraft were added to our fleet during we have lease financing commitments in place to accept delivery of b aircraft during distribution costs decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis 
our improvement in this area was primarily due to i a greater percentage of our passenger sales being generated online via our website  and ii savings generated by revisions to our commission structure 
we recognize significant savings when our sales are transacted via our website as opposed to more traditional methods such as through travel agents and global distribution systems 
during the second quarter of we revised our commission structure to eliminate the standard percent commission for travel agencies 
we continue to offer a percent commission for sales transacted through the travel agent section of our website 
our commission cost savings were partially offset by increased computer reservation system and credit card fees 
the additional transaction volume derived from our growth in revenue passengers generated the escalation in these fees 
maintenance  materials and repairs decreased million percent or percent on a casm basis 
on a block hour basis  maintenance costs declined percent to approximately per block hour  primarily reflecting the retirement of dc aircraft in and seven dc aircraft in the timing of maintenance to be performed is predominantly determined by the number of hours the aircraft and engines are operated and their age 
the composition of our aircraft fleet continued to shift toward a greater percentage of new b aircraft that generally require less costly and less frequent scheduled maintenance 
our maintenance costs are expected to increase as these aircraft age and are utilized more frequently 
landing fees and other rents increased million percent  and improved percent on a casm basis reflecting landing fee rate increases  growth in the number of flights we operated and the leasing of facilities at the new destinations added to our route network 
aircraft insurance and security services increased million percent or percent on a casm basis primarily from additional aircraft insurance premiums for war risk liability insurance 
in addition  our insured fleet hull value increased as a result of the new b aircraft deliveries while the overall rates for basic hull and liability coverage also increased 
marketing and advertising increased million percent  and improved percent on a casm basis primarily reflecting our promotional efforts associated with the development of our new destinations 
depreciation decreased million percent or percent on a casm basis primarily due to the retirement of owned aircraft during and seven owned aircraft during our depreciation expense was reduced further by the reduction in the net book value of our b and dc aircraft as recorded during the second and third quarters of  respectively  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
a revision to the useful life of our b fleet during and our discontinued amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets upon adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets during reduced our depreciation expense see note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation associated with additional spare parts and equipment provisioning for the b aircraft partially offset the aforementioned expense reductions 
other operating expenses increased million percent  and improved percent on a casm basis primarily from added passenger related costs associated with the higher level of operations  contractual costs related to the opening of new destinations and the costs associated with our new reservations system and other automation projects 
impairment loss lease termination represents i an impairment charge of million related to the write down of the net book value of our owned b fleet and for charges related to the termination of the lease on one b aircraft  and ii special charges of million related to the impairment of our owned dc aircraft fleet 
during the second quarter of we announced our intentions to retire our fleet of b aircraft in the third quarter of in order to simplify our fleet and reduce costs 
during the third quarter of  the september events had a profound impact on aircraft values worldwide  in particular on maintenance intensive  less fuel efficient aircraft such as b s  md s  as well as our dc fleet 
a significant number of the aircraft that were grounded by air carriers were of these aircraft types 
we performed evaluations of the b and dc aircraft fleets to determine  in accordance with sfas  whether future cash flows undiscounted and without in terest charges expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of these aircraft would be less than the aggregate carrying amount of these aircraft and related assets 
as a result of the evaluation  we determined that the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these aircraft would be less than their carrying amount  and therefore concluded that these aircraft were impaired as defined by sfas consequently  the net book value of the b and dc aircraft fleets and related assets were reduced during by approximately million to reflect the fair market value of these assets 
special charges primarily represent operating costs incurred during the faa s ground stop order following the september events 
government grant represents compensation in the form of grants from the federal government for direct and incremental losses associated with the terrorist events 
nonoperating expenses other expense  net decreased by million percent primarily due to reductions in interest expense  convertible debt discount amortization  and interest income  as well as adjustments related to our fuel hedges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
interest expense decreased as a result of having reduced our outstanding debt obligations during the period 
convertible debt discount amortization represents the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our convertible notes during upon conversion  we expensed million of the debt discount associated with this financial instrument 
interest income decreased due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances 
sfas adjustment income represents changes in the value of our now terminated fuel related derivative contracts see note to the consolidated finan cial statements 
income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit was million and million for and  respectively 
during we recorded income tax benefit of million due to a change in federal tax law as discussed below 
during  the differences between our effective tax rates and statutory rates result from the expected utilization of a portion of our net operating loss nol carryforwards  offset in part by alternative minimum tax amt and the application to goodwill of the tax benefit related to the realization of a portion of the airways corporation  inc nol carryforwards 
the job creation and worker assistance act of passed by congress in march resulted in a retroactive suspension of the amt nol percent limitation 
this legislation resulted in a tax benefit of million in in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes  the effect of changes in tax laws or rates is included in income in the period that includes the enactment date  resulting in recognition of the change in the first quarter of we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of existing nol carryforwards 
we have not recognized any such benefit because our evaluation of available evidence indicates an unacceptable degree of risk underlying any current assumption of sufficient future profitable operations to realize such benefit 
compared to summary we recorded a net loss  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  of million in per diluted share compared to net income of million per diluted share 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for  which related to our adoption of sfas  was million per diluted share  net of taxes of million see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our operating income for  including special items of million  was million compared to million in the special items in operating income reflect reductions in aircraft fleet values  aircraft lease termination charges  special charges related to the september events and the entire amount of compensation we expect to receive from the us government pursuant to the stabilization act 
our nonoperating expenses for  including a special item of million  were million compared to million in the specia l item in nonoperating expenses represents additional debt discount amortization resulting from the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our convertible notes 
upon conversion  we expensed million of the debt discount and million of debt issuance costs associated with our convertible notes 
a summary of the special items  including where the amounts are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations  is listed below in millions income expense description operating nonoperating total reduction of b and dc fleet values and lease termination charges see note september th special charges see note government grant see note debt discount amortization see note the net effect of these special items reduced our net income loss from million to million and reduced our earnings loss per common share from to 
operating revenues our operating revenues for the year increased million percent primarily due to an increase in passenger revenues 
we increased our capacity available seat miles or asms by percent due to the continuation of our fleet renewal program that resulted in the addition of b aircraft and the retirement of four dc and four b aircraft during the year 
our traffic revenue passenger miles or rpms increased by percent which when combined with the increase in asms resulted in a percentage point decline in our passenger load factor 
our passenger yields also declined by percent to cents per rpm  which in conjunction with the higher traffic resulted in a million increase in our passenger revenues 
cargo revenues declined by million during the year due to the fact that we carried less mail for the us postal service 
our financial results for the first eight months of were considerably different from those of the remainder of the year primarily due to the impact of the september events on our passenger revenues 
with the intent of providing a more meaningful understanding of this effect  we will further discuss the results in two time periods as follows january through august  and september through december 
for the period of january through august  the slowing of the us economy resulted initially in greater price awareness by air travelers followed by an overall decline in the demand for air travel 
this increased price awareness tended to benefit low fare airlines during this time period  as demonstrated by our revenue performance 
despite a nearly percent increase in capacity during this period  we experienced even higher levels of passenger demand which resulted in our load factor increasing by percentage points over the same period in the previous year 
our passenger yields also increased by percent to cents per rpm 
this resulted in our passenger revenues increasing by million over the comparable period in our passenger revenues for the period from september through december were significantly affected by the september events 
in response to the terrorist attacks  the federal aviation administration faa immediately issued a federal ground stop order on september th  which prohibited all civil aviation flights from operation within the national airspace of the united states 
the us airspace was not reopened until september th  at which time we operated a portion of our pre september th scheduled operations 
once flights resumed  passenger traffic and yields were significantly lower than we had experienced prior to september th 
in an effort to match our capacity to the reduced level of demand  we reduced our operations to levels similar to those we operated during the same period in  despite the fact that we had been successful in growing our capacity by percent earlier in the year 
in addition  many corporations curtailed their business travel and leisure travelers cancelled or postponed vacations  which forced airlines to reduce airfares in an attempt to stimulate demand 
despite these actions  our traffic dropped by over percent  which resulted in our passenger load factor declining eight percentage points compared to the previous year 
passenger yields also suffered during this period and declined nearly percent year over year 
this resulted in a million  or percent  decline in passenger revenues compared to the same time period in operating expenses our operating expenses increased by million percent on an asm increase of percent 
excluding the special items recognized during that are described above  our operating expenses increased by million percent 
operating cost per available seat mile casm  excluding the special items  increased percent from cents to cents  primarily due to the aircraft rent associated with the lease financing of a greater number of aircraft and increased personnel costs 
operating expenses per asm for and were as follows year ended december  percent change salaries  wages and benefits aircraft fuel maintenance  materials and repairs distribution landing fees and other rents marketing and advertising aircraft rent depreciation other operating total casm casm figures above were adjusted to exclude the following special items impairment loss lease termination of million  special charges of million and a government grant of million 
salaries  wages and benefits increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to increases in the number of employees to support our year over year growth  in addition to contractual wage and benefit increases for our employee groups represented by labor unions 
aircraft fuel expense  including fuel hedging activities  decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to a percent decrease in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel  offset by a percent increase in the quantity of fuel consumed in our flight operations 
our average price per gallon of aircraft fuel  including all fees and taxes  was cents in compared to cents in the and prices are net of million and million in hedging gains losses  respectively 
the improvement in aircraft fuel casm reflects the increased number of b aircraft and the retirement of dc and b aircraft during maintenance  materials and repairs decreased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to fewer dc and b airframe and engine repairs performed in accordance with our maintenance schedule 
the timing of maintenance to be performed is predominantly determined by the number of hours the aircraft and engines are operated and their age 
during  we retired the b aircraft type from our operating fleet in addition to four dc aircraft 
the composition of our aircraft fleet continued to shift toward a greater percentage of new b aircraft  which generally require less costly and less frequent scheduled maintenance 
distribution costs increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to a higher volume of transactions incurring computer reservations system crs fees 
our passenger enplanement increase of percent and million growth in passenger revenues generally correlated to a greater amount of sales subject to credit card transaction fees and sales commissions 
credit card and commission expenses were up percent and percent  respectively 
landing fees and other rents increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to our operations growth  in terms of both the number of cities served and total departures 
service to four new cities was introduced in grand bahama island  minneapolis st 
paul  pittsburgh and toledo  three new cities were introduced in baltimore washington  pensacola and tallahassee 
our facilities rent increased million  a significant portion of which came from the new cities we served 
our expanded operations generated an percent increase in the level of departures  which in turn raised our landing fees by million 
marketing and advertising expenses grew by million percent overall  but flat on a casm basis as we increased our promotional activity to support our inauguration of service to three new cities 
aircraft rent increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis as a result of the lease financing of new b aircraft 
during  we introduced one new b aircraft per month into our fleet  until december when three bs were added  for a total of new lease financed aircraft 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we lease financed three b aircraft which had been delivered in the fourth quarter of with interim financing from the manufacturer 
depreciation expense increased by million percent overall or percent on a casm basis due to an increase in dc capitalized improvements  the reassessment of our b salvage values and the provisioning of spare parts for our growing b aircraft fleet 
other operating expenses increased million percent overall or percent on a casm basis primarily due to significant increases to passenger liability insurance coverage and security costs in the fourth quarter of  employee training costs and passenger related costs associated with our growth during impairment loss lease termination expenses represent million of charges related to decreases in the fair market values of our dc and b aircraft fleets 
these charges were calculated in accordance with sfas in addition  we recorded a million charge related to the termination of a b lease see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special charges primarily represent operating costs incurred during the faa s ground stop order following the september events 
government grant represents the entire amount of compensation we expect to receive from the us government pursuant to the stabilization act see note to the consolidated financial statements 
nonoperating expenses other expense  net  included interest income and interest expense  a special item and an adjustment related to our fuel hedges in accordance with sfas interest income decreased percent primarily due to lower rates of return on invested cash  partially offset by higher amounts of invested cash 
interest expense decreased percent primarily due to overall lower debt obligations  partially offset by higher interest rates associated with our refinanced debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the special item represents additional debt discount amortization resulting from the exercise of conversion rights on approximately two thirds of our convertible notes 
upon conversion  we expensed million of the debt discount and million of debt issuance costs associated with our convertible notes 
these amounts are shown on the consolidated statements of operations as convertible debt discount amortization 
in accordance with sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements we also recognized fuel hedging gains of million 
income tax expense benefit our income tax expense was million compared to in the prior year 
the tax expense resulted from the utilization of a portion of our million of nol carryforwards existing at december   offset in part by amt and the application to goodwill of the tax benefit related to the realization of a portion of the airways corporation  inc nol carryforwards 
we have not recognized any benefit from the future use of existing nol carryforwards 
we have not recognized any such benefit because our evaluation of available evidence indicates an unacceptable degree of risk underlying any current assumption of sufficient future profitable operations to realize such benefit 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash  totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the deferral of million in excise tax payments until january in accordance with the stabilization act is reflected in our year end cash balance 
operating activities provided cash flows of million in compared to million in the primary components of our operating cash flows were net income improvements  air traffic liability growth  and reduced depreciation and amortization 
our net income improved by million primarily due to the growth of our business  as measured by passenger revenues 
as our business has grown  so has the level of our customers advance payments for future travel  commonly referred to as air traffic liability 
the primary reason for our depreciation and amortization related operating cash flows adjustments is attributable to the reduction of the original cost bases of our dc aircraft  as recognized in in accordance with sfas see note to the consolidated financial statements 
partially offsetting these primary components were i the growth of our interline receivables for our efforts to accommodate other airlines involuntarily displaced passengers on our flights  ii d eferred gains recognized commensurate with the sale leaseback of every b delivered to us during  iii the deferral of excise tax payments until january in accordance with the stabilization act  iv payments of prepaid aircraft rent associated with the majority of our bs  and v increases to the amount of cash temporarily withheld by our credit card processors related to our customers advance payments for future travel 
investing activities provided cash flows of million in compared to cash flows used of million in our property and equipment purchases in both years primarily consisted of spare parts and equipment provisioning for the b aircraft 
to a lesser extent our property and equipment purchases consisted of capital expenditures on leasehold improvements and computer equipment to support our operations growth particularly for the cities added to our route network during those years 
cash flows for aircraft purchase deposits relate to our agreement to acquire b aircraft 
during  we amended our b purchase agreement with the airframe manufacturer see commitments below 
pursuant to the amended b purchase agreement we were refunded deposits of approximately million in during  we paid approximately million as deposits toward the construction of our future b aircraft deliveries 
our proceeds from the disposal of equipment were million and million in and  respectively 
the disposals primarily consisted of certain b aircraft that we acquired during and then sold and leased back under a lease financing commitment with boeing capital services corporation boeing capital 
financing activities used million of cash in compared to million in financing activities for consisted primarily of scheduled payments of debt obligations 
financing activities for related to the refinancing of certain debt obligations associated with the boeing capital transactions see other information below 
commitments our contractual purchase commitments consist primarily of scheduled acquisitions of new boeing aircraft 
as of december   our remaining commitments with respect to b aircraft were for the acquisition of aircraft during all of the deliveries will be lease financed through boeing capital 
in connection with an agreement with the boeing company boeing to return approximately million in and million in of advance deposits under our b purchase agreement and by boeing capital to provide lease financing to us for up to previously owned and one new b aircraft to be added to our fleet during  we entered into an agreement on september  whereby boeing capital would have the option to cause us to prepay or purchase at par the outstanding series a senior secured notes  series b senior secured convertible notes  and senior secured notes collectively  the refinancing notes and the class c eetc certificates  series the eetc certificates  including accrued interest  if any  in each case to the extent issued to and held by boeing  its affiliates and or rolls royce plc  in the event we purchase or lease additional commercial jet aircraft in addition to i the b aircraft being financed by boeing capital  ii the b aircraft currently on order from boeing and iii certain replacement aircraft which are of the same type as currently in our fleet 
this agreement terminates upon the later of i payment in full of the refinancing notes and ii the earlier of payment in full of the eetc certificates or september  as of december   the aggregate principal balance of the debt we could be so required to prepay or purchase pursuant to this agreement was approximately million 
as of december   we had a total of six purchase options for b aircraft to be delivered in if we exercise our purchase options to acquire additional aircraft  additional payments could be required for these aircraft during and future years 
there can be no assurance that sufficient financing will be available for all aircraft and other capital expenditures not covered by firm financing commitments 
as of december   our deliveries of b aircraft from boeing totaled aircraft 
during  we took delivery of new b aircraft that were lease financed by boeing capital through sale leaseback transactions 
during  we took delivery of new b aircraft that were financed by boeing capital as follows aircraft were delivered through sale leaseback transactions with boeing capital  and one was purchased with a loan provided by boeing capital the loan was fully repaid in february and the aircraft was contemporaneously sold to and then leased back from boeing capital 
as of december   our debt obligations totaled million  with respect to which substantially all our assets are pledged as security 
our debt obligations are composed of million of eetcs  of which a portion of interest and principal is payable semiannually through april  and certain debt obligations due to boeing capital  as described in other information below 
the eetc proceeds were used to finance the purchase of the first b aircraft delivered all aircraft were pledged as collateral for the eetcs 
eight eetc financed bs were delivered in  and the remaining two deliveries occurred in during  we sold and leased back two of the eetc financed bs in a leveraged lease transaction reducing the outstanding principal amount of the eetcs by million 
our expected contractual obligations and commitments to be paid were the following as of december  in millions nature of commitment there after operating lease payments for aircraft and facility obligations aircraft fuel purchases long term debt obligations total contractual obligations and commitments excludes related interest payments 
a variety of assumptions were necessary in order to derive the information described in the paragraph herein  including  but not limited to i the timing of aircraft delivery dates  ii estimated rental factors which are correlated to floating interest rates prior to delivery  iii future fuel prices  including fuel refining  transportation and into plane costs  and iv estimated interest rates that are adjustable depending upon the market price of our common stock 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other information we entered into an amended and restated financing commitment with boeing capital services corporation boeing capital on march   and a series of definitive agreements on april   in order to refinance our million senior notes and airtran airways  inc s million senior secured notes due april collectively  the existing notes  and to provide additional liquidity 
the cash flow generated from the boeing capital transactions  together with internally generated funds  was used to retire the existing notes at maturity 
the components of the refinancing are as follows in thousands senior secured notes of airtran airways  inc due subordinated notes of airtran holdings  inc due convertible notes of airtran holdings  inc due under the new senior secured notes issued by our operating subsidiary  airtran airways  inc airtran airways  principal payments of approximately million plus interest are due and payable semiannually 
in addition  there are certain mandatory prepayment events  including for  a million prepayment upon the consummation of each of sale leaseback transactions and a million prepayment upon the consummation of each of sale leaseback transactions for b aircraft 
during  twenty prepayments occurred 
during  there were prepayment requirements of million upon the consummation of each of sale leaseback transactions for b aircraft 
during the year ended december   eleven prepayments occurred 
the new senior secured notes are secured by substantially all of the assets of airtran airways not previously encumbered  and are noncallable for four years 
in the fifth year  the senior secured notes may be prepaid at a premium of percent and in the sixth year at a premium of percent 
contemporaneously with the issuance of the new senior secured notes  we issued detachable warrants to boeing capital for the purchase of three million shares of our common stock at per share 
the warrants had an estimated value of million when issued and expire five years after issuance 
this amount is being amortized to interest expense over the life of the new senior secured notes 
under the subordinated notes  interest is due and payable semiannually in arrears  and no principal payments are due prior to maturity in  except for mandatory prepayments equal to percent of airtran airways net income which  subject to applicable law  airtran airways is required to dividend to us in cash on a quarterly basis for payment to the lender 
during and  we paid million and million  respectively  in principal on the subordinated notes in accordance with the requirements to pay percent of airtran airways net income from profitable quarters 
the convertible notes bear a higher rate of interest  specifically percent if our average common stock price during a calendar month is below 
this contingent interest feature is considered an embedded derivative under sfas and had no significant value at december  and quarterly valuations will continue to be made and recorded  if necessary  to reflect the derivative s fair value 
interest is payable semiannually in arrears 
the notes are convertible at any time into approximately million shares of our common stock 
this conversion rate represents a beneficial conversion feature valued at million 
this amount will be amortized to interest expense over the life of the convertible notes  or sooner upon conversion 
we are able to require boeing capital s conversion of the notes under certain circumstances 
during the third quarter of  boeing capital exercised approximately two thirds of their conversion rights resulting in a decrease of million of principal on the convertible notes 
in connection with the conversion  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to boeing capital 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we expensed million of the debt discount and million of debt issuance costs 
these amounts are shown on the consolidated statements of operations as other income expense convertible debt discount amortization 
the subordinated notes and convertible notes are secured by i a pledge of all of our rights under the b aircraft purchase agreement with the mcdonnell douglas corporation an affiliate of boeing capital  and ii a subordinated lien on the collateral securing the new senior secured notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates general 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below see note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
passenger and cargo revenue is recognized when transportation is provided 
transportation purchased but not yet used is included in air traffic liability 
accounting for long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas supercedes sfas we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events or circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the net book value of those assets 
in making these determinations  we utilize certain assumptions  including  but not limited to i estimated fair market value of the assets  and ii estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used in our operations  and estimated salvage values 
we have approximately million of long lived assets as of december   including approximately million of flight equipment and related equipment 
during  we determined our dc and b aircraft fleets were impaired in accordance with sfas and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively see note to the consolidated financial statements 
effective july   in order to more accurately reflect the expected useful lives of our b aircraft  we changed the estimate of the useful life of this aircraft type from to years 
as a result of this change  depreciation and amortization expense was reduced in and by approximately million and million  respectively 
spare parts  materials and supplies 
spare parts  materials and supplies are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method fifo 
these items are charged to expense when used 
allowances for obsolescence are provided over the estimated useful life of the related aircraft and engines for spare parts expected to be on hand at the date aircraft are retired from service 
new product we recently announced the creation of a new regional jet product called airtran jetconnect tm 
airtran jetconnect tm  operated by air wisconsin  features bombardier crj regional jets operated predominantly in short haul markets 
this service commenced on november   and initially operated to greensboro  nc  milwaukee  wi  pensacola  fl  and savannah  ga  from our operations hub at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
by the end of  airtran jetconnect tm may operate up to ten aircraft within our route network 
recent developments during december  we broke ground for a planned million hangar facility at hartsfield atlanta international airport 
the  square foot hangar will be large enough to hold two of our b aircraft simultaneously and will also have a  square foot  two story office building attached to the hangar to house engineers and other support staff 
completion of construction is expected by december the city of atlanta is financing construction of the facility 
upon completion  we intend to consummate a long term lease agreement for the hangar facility 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin also expands the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified 
the disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
we are currently analyzing the effect of fin on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires that companies that control another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate the controlled entity 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest in after that date 
the related disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
we are currently analyzing the effect of fin on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk sensitive instruments and positions we are subject to certain market risks  including interest rates and commodity prices ie  aircraft fuel 
the adverse effects of changes in these markets pose a potential loss as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our financial policies and additional information 
interest rates as of december  and  the fair value of our long term debt was estimated to be million and million  respectively  based upon discounted future cash flows using current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of instruments or market prices 
market risk  estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates  was approximately million as of december   and approximately million as of december  our long term debt obligations bear fixed rates of interest and may be prepaid without penalty prior to their respective maturity dates and  therefore  a change in market interest rates generally would not affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
aviation fuel our results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of aircraft fuel 
excluding special items  aircraft fuel accounted for percent and percent of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
based on our projected fuel consumption  a percent increase in the average price per gallon of aircraft fuel for the year ending december   would increase fuel expense for the next twelve months by approximately million  including the effects of our fuel hedges 
comparatively  based on fuel usage  a percent increase in fuel prices would have resulted in an increase in fuel expense of approximately million  including the effects of our fuel hedges 
in  we terminated our fuel hedging contracts consisting of swap agreements and entered into fixed price fuel contracts and fuel cap contracts to partially protect against significant increases in aircraft fuel prices 
at december   we had hedged approximately percent of our projected fuel requi rements for  as compared to approximately percent of our projected fuel requirements for at december  during the first quarter of  we entered into additional fuel cap contracts that increased our fuel commitments to approximately percent of our estimated fuel needs for
