item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion summarizes our operating results for compared to and compared to however  results are not directly comparable to results and results are not directly comparable to results due to a week year in and the effects of acquisitions in all years presented 
sales total sales were billion  billion and billion  for  and  respectively 
these sales represented annual increases of in and in excluding million of sales to adjust for the estimated effect of a rd week of sales in  the annual increase in would have been 
total food store sales were billion  billion  and billion  for  and  respectively 
fiscal results include approximately million of sales from a rd week in the differences between total sales and total food store sales primarily related to sales at our convenience store and jewelry store divisions  as well as to sales by our manufacturing plants to outside firms 
we define a food store as an identical store in the quarter after the store has been in operation and has not been expanded or relocated for four full quarters 
identical food store sales  as used to calculate each respective year s percent change in identical food store sales  were billion and billion for and  respectively 
identical food store sales were flat in compared to and increased in over we define a food store as a comparable store in the quarter after the store has been in operation for four full quarters including expansions and relocations 
comparable food store sales  as used to calculate each respective year s percent change in comparable food store sales  were billion and billion for and  respectively 
comparable food store sales increased in over and increased in over identical and comparable food store sales exclude the estimated effect of a rd week of sales in the differences between total food store sales  adjusted for the rd week in  and identical food store sales were primarily due to the increases in food store square footage as discussed below in capital expenditures 
the increase in the percent of total sales attributable to sales at supermarket fuel centers has significantly impacted our results 
at the end of  we operated supermarket fuel centers compared to and supermarket fuel centers at the end of and  respectively 
excluding sales at supermarket fuel centers  identical food store sales decreased in compared to and increased in over on the same basis  comparable food store sales were flat in compared to and increased in over our sales in were also affected by deflation in various commodity groups  the weak economy  war fears  increased competition and the results of our strategic growth plan plan 
the estimated impact of inflation and deflation is described below in impact of inflation 
we believe the effects of the weak economy and increased competition partially offset the benefits from kroger s price reductions associated with the plan in gross profit our gross profit rates were  and in  and  respectively 
we recorded a last in  first out lifo credit of million in compared to a lifo charge of million in and a lifo credit of million in excluding these lifo credits and charges  our gross profit rates were  and in  and  respectively 
these rates reflect our investment in lower retail prices as part of the plan in the effect of our investment in the plan was partially offset by decreases in product costs due to consolidated purchasing activities 
the increase in our gross profit rate in versus partially resulted from similar decreases in product costs 
improved private label sales and manufacturing plant results also increased our gross profit rates in both and the increase in the percent of total sales from supermarket fuel centers in versus reduced the gross profit rate by approximately basis points in versus and by approximately basis points in versus supermarket fuel center sales have a negative impact on our overall gross profit rate due to the relatively low gross profit rate on fuel sales 
some significant items recorded as merchandise costs in  and  further affected our gross profit rates 
these items are described below in significant items 
operating  general and administrative expenses operating  general and administrative og a expenses  which consist primarily of employee related costs such as wages  health care benefit costs and retirement plan costs  as a percent of sales were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in the percent of total sales from supermarket fuel centers in versus reduced our overall og a expense rate by approximately points in versus and by approximately basis points in versus supermarket fuel center sales have a positive impact on our overall og a expense rate due to the relatively low overhead costs associated with fuel sales 
a portion of the decrease in our og a expense rate in versus was due to the successful cost reduction and productivity initiatives associated with the strategic growth plan that we announced in december our og a rates declined in despite increases in our health care benefit costs  pension costs and credit card fees 
health care benefits costs  pension costs and credit card fees  as a percent of sales  increased approximately basis points  nine basis points and five basis points  respectively  in versus the increase in our og a rate in versus was also due to higher health care benefit costs and credit card fees 
additionally  utility costs increased as a percent of sales in versus some significant items recorded as operating  general and administrative expense in  and further affected our rates 
these items are described below in significant items 
rent expense rent expense  as a percent of sales  was  and in  and  respectively 
the decreases in these rates reflect the emphasis our current growth strategy places on ownership of real estate 
depreciation expense depreciation expense totaled  million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in depreciation expense primarily were due to kroger s capital investment program and the emphasis on ownership of real estate 
goodwill amortization in and  goodwill amortization expense totaled million and million  respectively 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which became effective for kroger on february   goodwill was not amortized in refer to critical accounting policies for a discussion of kroger s annual evaluation of the carrying amount of goodwill 
interest expense net interest expense totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these decreases resulted from lower interest rates on our floating rate debt in versus and in versus net interest expense also decreased in due to an overall reduction of outstanding debt in versus income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and in  and the effective income tax rates differ from the expected statutory rate primarily because of the effect of state taxes 
the effective rate for also differs from the effective rate for and due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill in the effective rate for was also affected by the write off of non deductible goodwill in net earnings net earnings totaled billion  or per diluted share  in these results represent an increase of approximately over net earnings of per diluted share for as described above  goodwill amortization expense totaled million  pre tax  in  but goodwill was not amortized in adjusting results to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect  as illustrated in note to the consolidated financial statements  net earnings would have been per diluted share  in on this basis  net earnings of per diluted share for represent an increase of approximately over net earnings of per diluted share for net earnings of per diluted share for represent an increase of approximately over net earnings of per diluted share for adjusting results in both years to eliminate the amortization of goodwill and its tax effect  as illustrated in note to the consolidated financial statements  net earnings would have been per diluted share in  an increase of over net earnings of per diluted share in significant items the following table summarizes items that significantly affected kroger s financial results during  and these items include asset impairment charges  restructuring charges  merger related costs and the cumulative effect of an accounting change  all of which are shown separately in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the items also include other charges and credits that were recorded as components of merchandise costs and operating  general and administrative expense

significant items in merchandise costs and in operating  general and administrative expense costs related to mergers costs related to mergers included expenses recognized as a consequence of the continued integration of the company s divisions 
integration primarily resulted from the company s merger with fred meyer 
these expenses primarily related to severance agreements  enterprise system and banner conversions  and inventory write downs 
item cost conversion in  prior to the merger with fred meyer  we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method 
the change improved the accuracy of product cost calculations by eliminating the averaging and estimation inherent in the retail method 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted the item cost method for the former fred meyer divisions 
the cumulative effect of this change on periods prior to february   cannot be determined 
the effect of the change on the february  inventory valuation  which includes other immaterial modifications in inventory valuation methods  was included in restated results for the quarter ended may  this change increased merchandise costs by million and reduced net earnings by million 
we did not calculate the pro forma effect on prior periods because cost information for these periods was not determinable 
the item cost method did not have a material effect on earnings subsequent to its adoption on february  adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
as described below in recently issued accounting standards  we adopted eitf issue no 
during the fourth quarter of this issue addresses the method by which retailers account for vendor allowances 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax charge of million 
this expense was offset by a corresponding pre tax lifo credit of million 
lease liabilities store closing plans in and  we recorded pre tax expenses of million and million  respectively  for the present value of lease liabilities related to store closings 
sales at stores considered in these charges totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net operating income or loss from these stores cannot be determined on a separately identifiable basis 
these liabilities were the result of two distinct  formalized plans that coordinated the closings of several locations over relatively short periods of time 
the liabilities pertained primarily to stores acquired in the fred meyer merger  or to stores operated prior to the merger that were in close proximity to stores acquired in the merger  that were identified as under performing stores 
therefore  liabilities were recorded for the anticipated closings of the stores 
due to the on going consolidation in our industry  certain stores remained open to determine if performance could be improved 
final determination regarding these stores will be made in the first quarter of fiscal refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these liabilities 
excess energy purchase commitments during the third quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair value of energy purchase commitments that provided for supplies in excess of our expected demand for electricity 
sfas no 
requires the excess commitments to be marked to fair value through current period earnings each quarter 
in  we recorded net pre tax income of million as a result of the market value adjustments of these excess commitments 
market value adjustments in the fourth quarter of resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements and to our discussion of commodity price protection below in liquidity and capital resources for additional details of these liabilities 
asset impairment charges during and  we recorded pre tax impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
in  we performed an impairment review due to new divisional leadership and updated profitability forecasts for and beyond 
in  we performed an impairment review due to recent investments by acquired companies in stores that did not perform as expected and updated profitability forecasts for and beyond 
in both years  we identified impairment losses for assets to be disposed of and for assets to be held and used 
in  we also identified impairment losses for investments in former suppliers that have experienced financial difficulty and with whom supply arrangements have ceased 
the charge related to locations that either had not opened  or had only recently opened  when the impairment charge was performed 
as a result  estimates of future operating performance for these locations were not determined at that time 
no asset impairment charges were recorded in refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 
restructuring charges on december   we outlined our strategic growth plan to support additional investment in core business to increase sales and market share 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million primarily for severance agreements associated with the plan 
restructuring charges related to the plan totaled million  pre tax  in the majority of the expenses related to severance agreements and distribution center consolidation and conversion costs 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 
merger related costs during  and  we recorded net  pre tax expenses of million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of restricted stock and the related market value adjustments 
the restrictions on these stock awards lapsed in based on the achievement of synergy goals established in connection with the fred meyer merger 
our merger related costs in also included million of severance expense 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for additional details of these charges 
cumulative effect of an accounting change as noted above in results of operations  we adopted sfas no 
on february  the transitional impairment review required by sfas no 
resulted in a million pre tax non cash loss to write off the jewelry store division goodwill based on its implied fair value 
impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis  rather than on an undiscounted basis  as was the standard under sfas no 
 prior to adoption of sfas no 
this loss was recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change  net of a million tax benefit  in the first quarter of for further details of this charge  refer to our discussion of sfas no 
in recently issued accounting standards 
common stock repurchase program in december of  we began a program to repurchase common stock to reduce dilution resulting from our employee stock option plans 
this program is solely funded by proceeds from stock option exercises  including the tax benefit 
in january of  the board of directors board authorized an additional repurchase of up to million of common stock 
on march   the board authorized the repurchase of up to million of kroger common stock 
this repurchase program replaced the million program authorized in january of during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million under the stock option program and million under the million program 
on march   the board authorized the repurchase of an incremental billion of kroger common stock 
this repurchase program was in addition to the million stock buyback authorized in during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million under the stock option program and million to complete the million program 
we also made open market purchases of million under the billion authorization 
during fiscal  we made open market purchases of approximately million to complete the billion program 
effective december   the board authorized a new stock repurchase program totaling million 
we made open market purchases of million under this plan in we also reacquired approximately million under the stock option program in fiscal purchases of stock under the board approved repurchase programs are made when the expected return exceeds our cost of capital 
capital expenditures capital expenditures excluding acquisitions totaled billion in compared to billion in and billion in most amounts were used to construct new stores 
capital expenditures in included million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease 
the table below shows our supermarket storing activity and our total food store square footage beginning of year opened opened relocation acquired acquired relocation closed operational closed relocation end of year total food store square footage in millions critical accounting policies we have chosen accounting policies that we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
the significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance costs we primarily are self insured for costs related to workers compensation and general liability claims 
liabilities are actuarially determined and are recognized based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
the liabilities for workers compensation claims are accounted for on a present value basis 
we have purchased stop loss coverage to limit our exposure to any significant exposure on a per claim basis 
we are insured for covered costs in excess of these per claim limits 
the assumptions underlying the ultimate costs of existing claim losses are subject to a high degree of unpredictability  which can affect the liability recorded for such claims 
for example  variability in inflation rates of health care costs inherent in these claims can affect the amounts realized 
similarly  changes in legal trends and interpretations  as well as a change in the nature and method of how claims are settled can impact ultimate costs 
although our estimates of liabilities incurred do not anticipate significant changes in historical trends for these variables  any changes could have a considerable effect upon future claim costs and currently recorded liabilities 
impairments of long lived assets we monitor the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether trigger events have occurred 
these events include current period losses combined with a history of losses or a projection of continuing losses or a significant decrease in the market value of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  an impairment calculation is performed  comparing projected undiscounted cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information and expected growth rates related to specific stores  to the carrying value for those stores 
if impairment is identified for long lived assets to be held and used  we compare discounted future cash flows to the asset s current carrying value 
we record impairment when the carrying value exceeds the discounted cash flows 
with respect to owned property and equipment held for disposal  the value of the property and equipment is adjusted to reflect recoverable values based on our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair market value  reduced by estimated direct costs of disposal 
any reductions in the carrying value of assets resulting from the application of this policy are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as asset impairment charges 
goodwill we adopted sfas no 
on february  accordingly  goodwill is reviewed for impairment during the fourth quarter of each year  and also upon the occurrence of trigger events 
the reviews are performed at the operating division level 
generally  fair value represents a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows  and is compared to the carrying value of a division for purposes of identifying potential impairment 
if potential for impairment is identified  the fair value of a division is measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
goodwill impairment is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the division s goodwill over the implied fair value 
for details of the goodwill impairment reviews performed during  refer to our discussion of sfas no 
in recently issued accounting standards 
the annual impairment review requires the extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates 
application of alternative assumptions and definitions  such as reviewing goodwill for impairment at a different organizational level  could produce significantly different results 
store closing costs we provide for closed store liabilities relating to the present value of the estimated remaining noncancellable lease payments after the anticipated closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
we estimate the net lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining net rent payments on closed stores 
the closed store lease liabilities usually are paid over the lease terms associated with the closed stores  which generally have remaining terms ranging from one to years 
for owned stores that we intend to sell  we actively market the stores to potential buyers 
owned stores held for disposal are reduced to their estimated net realizable value 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect estimated recoverable values 
we estimate subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on our experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed store is located  our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and current economic conditions 
however  the ultimate cost of the disposition of these leases and related assets is affected by current real estate markets  inflation rates  and general economic conditions 
store closings generally are completed within one year after the decision to close 
adjustments to closed store liabilities primarily relate to changes in subtenant and actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the change becomes known 
any excess store closing liability remaining upon settlement of the obligation is reversed to income in the period that the settlement is determined 
other costs related to individual operational store closings initiated by local divisional management  including costs to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment  are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as operating  general and administrative costs 
reductions in the carrying value of property and equipment related to stores closed in connection with a corporate level strategic plan are reflected in the consolidated statements of earnings as asset impairment charges in accordance with our policy on impairments of long lived assets 
inventory write downs  if any  in connection with store closings  are classified in merchandise costs 
costs to transfer inventory and equipment from closed stores are expensed as incurred 
store closing liabilities are reviewed quarterly to ensure that any accrued amount that is not a sufficient estimate of future costs  or that no longer is needed for its originally intended purpose  is adjusted to income in the proper period 
as noted below in recently issued accounting standards  sfas no 
became effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  all closed store liabilities related to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   have been and will continue to be accounted for accordingly 
purchase commitments occasionally  we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
upon entering into these commitments  and on a quarterly basis thereafter  we evaluate our expectation to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of our normal course of business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in our normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales 
for any commitments for which we do not expect to utilize or take delivery and  as a result  will require net settlement  the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 
benefit plans the determination of our obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon our selection of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other post retirement obligations and our future expense 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses the impact of a change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on other post retirement benefit costs and the related liability 
the discount rate was lowered to as of february   from as of february  the basis point reduction in the discount rate increased the pension projected benefit obligation as of february   by million 
in  we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by million as a result of this change 
we also reduced the compensation increase assumption to as of february   from as of february  the basis point reduction in the compensation increase assumption reduced the pension projected benefit obligation as of february   by million 
in  we expect that the annual pension expense will decrease by million as a result of this change 
we intend to reduce the pension return assumption of for to for our pension plan s average annual return for the fiscal years ending february   was  net of all fees and expenses 
we believe the reduction in the pension return assumption is appropriate because we do not expect that future returns will achieve the same level of performance as the historical average annual return 
beginning in fiscal  we expect that the annual pension expense will increase by million as a result of the reduction in expected return from to 
in addition  we are adding an assumption for non asset related expenses paid out of the trust 
this assumption will add million to the annual pension expense 
on february   we made a cash contribution of million to our pension plans 
approximately of this contribution was required minimum funding for that was not required to be funded until september of the remaining of the contribution was discretionary 
we also participate in various multi employer plans for substantially all union employees 
we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements 
pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded 
benefits are generally based upon a fixed amount for each year of service 
a decline in the value of assets held by these plans  caused by performance of the investments in the financial markets in recent years  is likely to result in higher contributions to these plans and to create challenges in our collective bargaining 
moreover  if we exit markets  we may be required to pay a potential withdrawal liability if the plans were under funded at the time of withdrawal 
however  we are unable to determine the amount of potential liability at this time 
any adjustments will be recorded when it is probable that a liability exists and it is determined that markets will be exited 
stock option plans we apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans 
accordingly  because the exercise price of the option granted equals the market value of the underlying stock on the option grant date  no stock based compensation expense is included in net earnings  other than expenses related to restricted stock awards 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements describe the effect on net earnings if compensation cost for all options had been determined based on the fair market value at the grant date for awards  consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally on a lifo basis or market 
in total  approximately of inventories for and approximately of inventories for were valued using the lifo method 
cost for the balance of the inventories was determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
replacement cost was higher than the carrying amount by million at february   and by million at february  as described above in significant items  we changed our application of the lifo method of accounting for certain store inventories from the retail method to the item cost method for the former fred meyer divisions during we evaluate inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in our facilities 
we record allowances for inventory shortages based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the balance sheet date 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of products are recognized at the point of sale of our products 
discounts provided to customers at the point of sale are recognized as a reduction in sales as the products are sold 
merchandise costs  including advertising  warehousing and transportation in addition to the product costs  net of discounts and allowances  advertising costs  inbound freight charges  warehousing costs  including receiving and inspection costs  and transportation costs are included in the merchandise costs  including advertising  warehousing and transportation line item of the consolidated statements of earnings 
purchasing management salaries and administration costs are included in the operating  general  and administrative line item along with most of our other managerial and administrative costs 
warehousing and transportation costs include distribution center direct wages  repairs and maintenance  utilities  inbound freight and  where applicable  third party warehouse management fees  as well as transportation direct wages and repairs and maintenance 
these costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred 
advertising costs are recognized in the periods the related expenses are incurred 
whenever possible  vendor rebates  credits and promotional allowances that relate to our buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
in those instances  the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs when the related merchandise is sold 
we believe the classification of costs included in merchandise costs could vary widely throughout our industry 
our approach is to include the direct  net costs of acquiring products and making them available to customers in our stores in the merchandise cost line item 
we believe this approach most accurately presents the actual costs of products sold  and is consistent with recently issued accounting standards on the topic 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow information cash from operations was billion in compared to billion in and billion in the increase in over was due to an increase in earnings and a reduction of operating assets and liabilities 
increased earnings in were offset by increases in the use of cash for operating assets and liabilities 
cash used by investing activities was billion in compared to billion in and billion in the amount of cash used by investing activities in was approximately equal to the amount used in due to consistent capital spending in and capital expenditures in included million related to the purchase of assets previously financed under a synthetic lease 
the increase in over was due to increased capital spending 
during   and  our capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  totaled  million   million and  million  respectively 
we spent million for acquisitions during compared to million during and million in we opened  acquired  expanded  or relocated food stores in  food stores in and food stores in during those same periods  we remodeled  and food stores  respectively 
cash used by financing activities was billion in compared to million in and million in the increase in the use of cash in versus was due to a reduction of our outstanding debt and to an increase in our treasury stock purchases in the decrease in the use of cash in versus primarily was due to increased borrowings in  offset by increased treasury stock purchases 
ebitda our bank credit facilities and the indentures underlying our publicly issued debt contain various restrictive covenants 
some of these covenants are based on ebitda  which we historically defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  lifo  extraordinary losses and one time items 
in prior years  we disclosed and discussed ebitda accordingly  as we believed it was an important means by which to measure our liquidity or compliance with our debt covenants  and also a measure by which management monitored our operating results 
furthermore  that measure of ebitda is used  in part  to determine incentive compensation 
on january   the sec issued release no 
that set forth new requirements relating to the disclosure of non gaap financial measures  as defined in the release 
the release provides an exemption with respect to disclosures of ebit and ebitda when discussing charges or liabilities that require  or will require  cash settlement  provided that the amounts are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
however  the definition of ebitda we have historically used includes an adjustment for non recurring  infrequent or unusual items one time items  and our description of this non gaap measure of liquidity could be considered confusingly similar to descriptions used for gaap financial measures and permitted non gaap financial measures such as ebit or ebitda 
as a result  the definition of ebitda we have historically used is prohibited by sec release no 
we will continue to present ebitda as we continue to believe it is an important means by which to measure our liquidity 
however  any future presentation of ebitda will be in accordance with sec release no 
we do not intend the presentation of ebitda to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance or liquidity 
the following table provides a reconciliation of ebitda for the fiscal years of  and consistent with release no

the increase in was due to increases in capital spending  stock repurchase programs and operating assets and liabilities 
we purchased a portion of the debt issued by the lenders of some of our structured financings in an effort to reduce our effective interest expense 
we also prefunded employee benefit costs of million at year end  million at year end and million at year end additionally  the mark to market adjustments necessary to record fair value interest rate hedges of our fixed rate debt  pursuant to sfas no 
 increased the carrying value of our debt by million as of year end and reduced the carrying value of our debt by million as of year end if we exclude the debt incurred to make these purchases  which we classify as investments  and the prefunding of employee benefits  and also exclude the sfas no 
mark to market adjustments  our net total debt would have been billion as of year end  compared to billion as of year end and billion as of year end we believe net total debt is an important measure of our leverage due to the nature of the items described above 
therefore  we believe net total debt should be reviewed in addition to total debt 
we do not intend the presentation of net total debt to be an alternative to total debt or to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of liquidity 
a reconciliation of net total debt is illustrated below year end year end year end in millions total debt mark to market adjustments investments in debt securities prefunded employee benefits veba net total debt factors affecting liquidity we currently borrow on a daily basis approximately million to million under our unrated commercial paper cp program 
these borrowings are backed by our credit facilities  and reduce the amount we can borrow under the credit facilities 
we have capacity available under our credit facilities to fund all cp amounts outstanding 
if our credit rating declined below its current level of bbb baa  the ability to borrow under the cp program could be adversely affected for a period of time immediately following the reduction of our credit rating 
this would require us to borrow additional funds under the credit facilities  under which we believe we have sufficient capacity 
borrowings under the credit facilities may be more costly than the money we borrow under our current cp program  depending on the current interest rate environment 
however  in the event of a ratings decline  we do not anticipate that access to the cp markets currently available to us would be significantly limited for an extended period of time ie in excess of days 
although our ability to borrow under the credit facilities is not affected by our credit rating  the interest cost on borrowings under the credit facilities would be affected not only by a decrease in our credit rating  but also by a failure to maintain the financial covenants contained in our credit agreements 
we were in compliance with these financial covenants as of february  the tables below illustrate our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of february  in millions of dollars thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations  net of interest operating lease obligations construction commitments unconditional purchase obligations other commercial commitments credit facilities standby letters of credit surety bonds guarantees synthetic lease these borrowings also are included in the long term debt contractual obligation amounts 
the construction commitments include capital to be expended for projects that were either under construction  or for which a lease had been signed  as of february  our unconditional purchase obligations include purchase commitments to be utilized in the normal course of business  such as several contracts to purchase raw materials utilized in our manufacturing plants and several contracts to purchase energy to be used in our stores and manufacturing facilities 
the obligations include purchases required under a product supply agreement with santee dairies  inc santee in los angeles  california 
we indirectly own a interest in the entity that owns santee 
upon fred meyer s acquisition of ralphs food less  santee became a duplicate facility 
the product supply agreement  which expires on july   requires us to purchase million gallons of fluid milk and other products annually 
the other partner has filed suit against kroger claiming  among other things  that the company is obligated to purchase all of the requirements of fluid milk for its ralphs and food less divisions from santee as opposed to minimum gallons 
our unconditional purchase obligations also include management fees for facilities operated by third parties 
as of february   we maintained three bank credit facilities  consisting of an million five year credit agreement  a million five year credit agreement and a billion day credit agreement 
the million five year facility terminates on may   unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger 
the million five year facility terminates on may   unless extended or earlier terminated by kroger 
the day facility terminates on may   unless extended  converted into a one year term loan  or earlier terminated by kroger 
at february   we also maintained a million money market line 
in addition to credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings  borrowings under the money market line and some outstanding letters of credit reduce funds available under the credit agreements 
at february   those letters of credit totaled million 
we had no borrowings under the money market line at february  the credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long term borrowings because we expect that these borrowings will be refinanced using the same type of securities 
we have the ability to refinance these borrowings on a long term basis  and have presented the amounts accordingly 
the money market line borrowings allow us to borrow from banks at mutually agreed upon rates  usually at rates below the rates offered under the credit agreements 
at february   the amount of outstanding credit agreement and commercial paper borrowings was unusually low  relative to the amount of outstanding senior notes  due primarily to the issuance of million senior notes in late january of the proceeds of this issuance were used to temporarily reduce amounts outstanding under the credit agreements prior to the purchase  on february   of the assets that were financed under a synthetic lease at february   and the repayment of million senior notes on march  the asset purchase and note repayments were funded primarily by credit agreement borrowings 
the synthetic lease is more fully described below 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further details of our debt obligations 
in addition to the available credit mentioned above  as of february   we had available for issuance billion of securities under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec on june   as amended in a filing made on july   and declared effective on july  we also maintain surety bonds related primarily to our self insured insurance costs 
these bonds are required by most states in which we are self insured for workers compensation and general liability exposures  and are made with third party insurance providers to insure payment of our insurance obligations in the event we are unable to make those payments 
these bonds do not represent liabilities of kroger  as we already have liabilities on our books for the insurance costs 
however  we do pay annual maintenance fees to have these bonds in place 
market changes may make the surety bonds more costly and  in some instances  availability of these bonds may become more limited  which could affect our costs of or access to such bonds 
although we do not believe increased costs or decreased availability would significantly impact our ability to access these surety bonds  if this does become an issue  we likely would issue letters of credit against our credit facilities to meet the state bonding requirements 
this could both increase our costs and decrease the funds available to us under our credit facilities 
most of our outstanding public debt is jointly and severally  fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the kroger co 
and some of its subsidiaries 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of those arrangements 
in addition  we have guaranteed half of the indebtedness of two real estate joint ventures in which we are a partner with ownership 
our share of the responsibility for this indebtednesss  should these partnerships be unable to meet their obligations  totals approximately million 
based on the covenants underlying this indebtedness as of february   it is unlikely that we will be responsible for repayment of these obligations 
we have also guaranteed approximately million of promissory notes of a third real estate partnership 
we believe it is reasonably possible that we will be required to fund most of this obligation when the notes mature in at february   we were a party to a financing transaction related to properties that were constructed for total costs of approximately million 
under the terms of the financing transaction  which was structured as a synthetic lease  a special purpose trust owned the properties and leased them to subsidiaries of kroger 
the lease had a term of five years  which expired on february  the owner of the special purpose trust made a substantive residual equity investment 
the transaction  therefore  was accounted for as an operating lease and the related costs were reported as rent expense 
kroger purchased the assets for total costs of million when the lease expired 
we are also contingently liable for leases that have been assigned to various third parties in connection with facility closings and dispositions 
we could be required to assume leases if any of the assignees are unable to fulfill their lease obligations 
due to the wide distribution of our assignments among third parties  and various other remedies available to us  we believe the likelihood that we will be required to assume a material amount of these obligations is remote 
impact of inflation while management believes that kroger s sales results are affected by product cost inflation and deflation  it is difficult to segregate and to measure the effects of inflation and deflation on our retail prices because of changes in the types of merchandise sold year to year and other pricing and competitive influences 
in  we estimate that kroger experienced overall product cost deflation of 
excluding supermarket fuel centers  we estimate our product cost deflation was also 
we recorded a pre tax lifo credit of million in this amount was larger than expected and included a million pre tax credit recorded as a result of the adoption of eitf product cost deflation in our jewelry divisions and in the general merchandise departments in our fred meyer stores accounted for most of the remaining million pre tax credit 
we estimate that kroger experienced overall product cost inflation of in we experienced deflation in our costs of product of some commodities due to management s success in obtaining synergies and the economies of scale resulting from recent mergers 
costs of other commodities  such as pharmacy and general merchandise  increased in recently issued accounting standards eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  became effective for kroger on january  this issue addresses the appropriate accounting for consideration received from a vendor 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
historically  we recognized those allowances as they were earned  based on the fulfillment of the related obligations of the contract 
this accounting treatment was consistent with generally accepted accounting principles 
for all contracts entered or modified after january   we have recognized prospectively  and will continue to recognize  vendor allowances when the related merchandise is sold  in accordance with issue no 
net earnings were not affected by the adoption of issue no 
adoption of issue no 
resulted in a million pre tax charge that was included in merchandise costs in this expense was offset by a corresponding million pre tax lifo credit that was also included in merchandise costs in sfas no 
 business combinations  was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in june of this standard requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for under the purchase method of accounting

sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  was issued by the fasb in june of the statement addresses the accounting for intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination 
the statement also addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to initial recognition 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill no longer will be amortized and instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
kroger adopted sfas no 
on february  accordingly  we performed a transitional impairment review of our goodwill 
goodwill totaled  million as of february  the review was performed at the operating division level 
generally  fair value represented a multiple of earnings  or discounted projected future cash flows 
impairment was indicated when the carrying value of a division  including goodwill  exceeded its fair value 
we determined that the carrying value of the jewelry store division  which included million of goodwill  exceeded its fair value 
impairment was not indicated for the goodwill associated with the other operating divisions 
the fair value of the jewelry store division was subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the division s goodwill 
as a result of this analysis  we determined that the jewelry store division goodwill was entirely impaired 
impairment primarily resulted from the recent operating performance of the division and review of the division s projected future cash flows on a discounted basis  rather than on an undiscounted basis  as was the standard under sfas no 
 prior to adoption of sfas no 
accordingly  we recorded a million charge  net of a million tax benefit  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of kroger s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of no impairment was indicated as a result of the fourth quarter  review

fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  was issued by the fasb in november of fin addresses a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of some guarantees 
the provisions of fin relating to initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  these provisions did not have a material effect on our financial statements in fiscal the disclosure requirements of fin became effective for kroger in fiscal and are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures also are summarized above in factors affecting liquidity 
any future guarantees issued by kroger will be accounted for in compliance with this interpretation 
fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  was issued by the fasb in january of fin provides guidance relating to the identification of  and financial reporting for  variable interest entities  as defined in the interpretation 
fin is effective for all variable interest entities created after january  for any variable interest entities created prior to february   fin will become effective for kroger on august  we are analyzing our structured financing arrangements  joint ventures and partnerships to determine the effect this interpretation will have on our financial statements 
if we are required to consolidate any entity  we anticipate that such consolidation will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
outlook this analysis contains certain forward looking statements about kroger s future performance 
these statements are based on management s assumptions and beliefs in light of the information currently available 
such statements relate to  among other things projected growth in earnings per share eps  working capital reduction  our ability to generate operating cash flow  and our strategic growth plan plan  and are indicated by words or phrases such as comfortable  committed  expects  goal  target  and similar words or phrases 
these forward looking statements are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
statements elsewhere in this report and below regarding our expectations  projections  beliefs  intentions or strategies are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of while we believe that the statements are accurate  uncertainties about the general economy  our labor relations  our ability to execute our plans on a timely basis and other uncertainties described below could cause actual results to differ materially from those statements 
on december   we outlined the plan to support additional investment in core business to grow sales and increase market share 
the plan has three key elements reduction of operating  general and administrative expenses  increased coordination of merchandising and procurement activities  and targeted retail price reductions 
as of february   we had reduced costs by approximately million 
in  we eliminated approximately  managerial and clerical positions targeted for reduction under the plan 
we also merged the nashville division office and distribution center into the atlanta and mid south divisions 
we expect to exceed our original goal of million in cost reductions by the end of fiscal our identical food store sales  including supermarket fuel centers  were flat in compared to we believe the effects of the weak economy and increased competition partially offset the effects of kroger s price reductions associated with the plan in our sales results are further described above in results of operations 
the estimated impact of product cost deflation is described above in impact of inflation 
as of february   restructuring costs related to the plan totaled approximately million 
these charges related primarily to severance agreements  distribution center consolidation and conversion costs 
we believe the continued enhancement of the plan will improve our competitive position 
we have identified additional opportunities to reduce costs and operate more efficiently 
for example  in march of  we announced the combining of two retail divisions headquartered in livonia  michigan  and columbus  ohio 
for  we estimate that earnings per share will be 
this estimate includes approximately of expense per share for systems conversions and the consolidation of the michigan and columbus divisions 
the estimate also includes increases in pension expense and health care costs 
the effect of any mark to market of the excess energy purchase commitments described above in significant items is excluded from our eps estimate because it is not possible to estimate an effect at this time 
we expect our identical food store sales  including fuel  will be positive in these estimates assume that inflation will be flat and that the economic and competitive environment will remain unchanged 
at this time  we are not providing sales or earnings guidance beyond fiscal based on the current interest rate environment  we expect interest expense to total approximately million to million in additionally  for  we expect depreciation expense to total approximately  million to  million 
we expect our og a expense rate to increase approximately to basis points and our gross profit rate  excluding the effect of lifo  to increase approximately to basis points in we expect to incur a lifo charge of approximately million for in the third quarter of  we established a goal to reduce net operating working capital by a total of million by the end of the third quarter net operating working capital was defined in this goal as current operating assets before lifo credit  less current operating liabilities 
therefore  we historically presented net operating working capital based on this definition 
on january   the sec issued release no 
that set forth new requirements relating to the disclosure of non gaap financial measures  as defined in the release 
the release allows for presentation of certain non gaap financial measures provided that the measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
we will continue to present net operating working capital  as we believe it is an important means by which to measure our operating financial performance for working capital and it is the basis by which senior management measures progress against the goal established in however  in accordance with release no 
 all future presentation of net operating working capital will be reconciled to the more widely recognized definition of working capital current assets less current liabilities 
we do not intend the presentation of net operating working capital to be an alternative to any generally accepted accounting principle measure of performance 
at the end of  working capital decreased million compared to the end of and decreased million compared to end of at the end of  comparative net operating working capital decreased million compared to the end of and decreased million compared to the end of we expect to reduce net operating working capital by million in a reconciliation of net operating working capital as of year end  and is shown below year end year end year end in millions current assets less current liabilities working capital addback subtract lifo reserve current portion of long term debt  including capital leases net current accrued deferred income tax assets liabilities property held for sale prefunded employee benefits net operating working capital item cost comparative adjustment eitf comparative adjustment comparative net operating working capital for comparative purposes  amounts in and have been adjusted to reflect these inventory adjustments recorded in these adjustments are described in significant items 
we obtain sales growth from new square footage  as well as from increased productivity from existing locations 
for  we expect full year square footage to grow to  excluding acquisitions and operational closings 
we expect combination stores to increase our sales per customer by including numerous specialty departments  such as pharmacies  natural food markets  supermarket fuel centers  seafood shops  floral shops  and bakeries 
we believe the combination store format will allow us to withstand continued competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
capital expenditures reflect our strategy of growth through expansion and acquisition as well as our emphasis on self development and ownership of real estate  and on logistics and technology improvements 
the continued capital spending in technology focusing on improved store operations  logistics  manufacturing procurement  category management  merchandising and buying practices  should reduce merchandising costs as a percent of sales 
for fiscal  we expect capital spending to be approximately billion  excluding acquisitions and purchase of assets financed under the synthetic lease at february  we intend to use the combination of cash flow from operations  including reductions in working capital  and borrowings under credit facilities to finance capital expenditure requirements 
if determined preferable  we may fund capital expenditure requirements by mortgaging facilities  entering into sale leaseback transactions  or by issuing additional debt or equity 
based on current operating results  we believe that cash flow from operations and other sources of liquidity  including borrowings under our commercial paper program and bank credit facilities  will be adequate to meet anticipated requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  interest payments and scheduled principal payments for the foreseeable future 
we also believe we have adequate coverage of our debt covenants to continue to respond effectively to competitive conditions 
we expect the change in og a will be affected by increased costs  such as health care benefit costs  pension costs and credit card fees 
we expect that our pension and health care benefit expense will increase approximately million and million  respectively  in versus these estimates include expenses related to our company sponsored plans as well as estimated contributions to multi employer plans 
various uncertainties and other factors could cause us to fail to achieve our goals 
these include our ability to achieve sales and eps goals will be affected primarily by industry consolidation  pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional competitors  our response to these actions  the state of the economy  including the deflationary trends in certain commodities  stock repurchases and the success of our plan 
in addition to the factors identified above  our identical store sales growth could be affected by increases in kroger private label sales  the impact of sister stores  as well as reductions in retail pricing 
kroger s eps growth goals could be affected by recessionary trends in the economy  our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we have identified  including those to reduce shrink and og a  continued increases in health care  pension and credit card fees  and the success of our capital investments 
in addition to the company sponsored pension plans  we participate in various multi employer pension plans for substantially all union employees 
we are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements 
pension expense for these plans is recognized as contributions are funded 
benefits are generally based upon a fixed amount for each year of service 
a decline in the value of assets held by these plans  caused by performance of the investments in the financial markets in recent years  is likely to result in higher contributions to these plans and to create challenges in our collective bargaining 
moreover  if we were to exit certain markets  we may be required to pay a withdrawal liability if the plans were under funded at the time of withdrawal 
our efforts to meet our working capital reduction targets could be adversely affected by increases in product costs  newly opened or consolidated distribution centers  our ability to obtain sales growth from new square footage  competitive activity in the markets in which we operate  changes in our product mix  and changes in laws and regulations 
the results of our plan and our ability to generate operating cash flow to the extent expected could be adversely affected if any of the factors identified above negatively impacts our operations  or if any of our underlying strategies  including those to reduce shrink and og a and to increase productivity  are not achieved 
in addition  the timing of the execution of the plan could adversely impact our eps and sales results 
consolidation in the food industry is likely to continue and the effects on our business  favorable or unfavorable  cannot be foreseen 
the results of our plan  including the amount and timing of cost savings expected  could be adversely affected due to pricing and promotional activities of existing and new competitors  including non traditional retailers  our response actions  the state of the economy  including deflationary trends in certain commodities  recessionary times in the economy  our ability to achieve the cost reductions that we have identified  including those to reduce shrink and operating  general and administrative expense  increases in health care  pension and credit card fees  and the success of our capital investments 
the cost associated with implementation of our strategic growth plan  as well as the amount and timing of our expected cost reductions  could be affected by a worsening economy  increased competitive pressures  and an inability on our part to implement the strategic growth plan when expected 
in fiscal  ufcw contracts will expire in peoria  illinois  portland  oregon  memphis  tennessee  charleston  west virginia  indianapolis  indiana  arizona and southern california 
we also have several other smaller contracts that will expire in in all of these contracts  rising health care and pension costs will continue to be an important issue in negotiations 
we cannot be certain that agreements will be reached without work stoppage 
a prolonged work stoppage affecting a substantial number of stores could have a material effect on the results of our operations 
depreciation expense  which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital leases  is computed principally using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of individual assets  or remaining terms of leases 
use of the straight line method of depreciation creates a risk that future assets write offs or potential impairment charges related to store closings would be larger than if an accelerated method of depreciation was followed 
a decline in the generation of sufficient cash flows to support capital expansion plans  share repurchase programs and general operating activities could cause our growth to slow significantly and may cause us to miss our earnings per share growth targets  because we obtain some of our sales growth from new square footage 
the grocery retailing industry continues to experience fierce competition from other food retailers  supercenters  mass merchandisers  club or warehouse stores  drug stores and restaurants 
our continued success is dependent upon our ability to compete in this industry and continue to reduce operating expenses  including managing health care and pension costs contained in our collective bargaining agreements 
the competitive environment may cause us to reduce our prices in order to gain or maintain share of sales  thus reducing margins 
while we believe our opportunities for sustained  profitable growth are considerable  unanticipated actions of competitors could impact our sales and net income 
changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards  taxation requirements  and environmental laws may have a material impact on our financial statements 
changes in the general business and economic conditions in our operating regions  including the rate of inflation  population growth  and employment and job growth in the markets in which we operate may affect our ability to hire and train qualified employees to operate our stores 
this would negatively affect earnings and sales growth 
general economic changes may also affect the shopping habits of our customers  which could affect sales and earnings 
changes in our product mix may negatively affect certain financial indicators 
for example  we have added and will continue to add supermarket fuel centers 
since gasoline is a low profit margin item with high sales dollars  we expect to see our gross profit margins decrease as we sell more gasoline 
although this negatively affects our gross profit margin  gasoline provides a positive effect on operating  general and administrative expense as a percent of sales 
our ability to integrate any companies we acquire or have acquired and achieve operating improvements at those companies will affect our operations 
we retain a portion of the exposure for our workers compensation and general liability claims 
it is possible that these claims may cause significant expenditures that would affect our operating cash flows 
our capital expenditures could differ from our estimate if we are unsuccessful in acquiring suitable sites for new stores  if development costs vary from those budgeted  or if our logistics and technology projects are not completed in the time frame expected or on budget 
depreciation and amortization expenses may vary from our estimates due to the timing of new store openings 
interest expense will vary with changes in capital markets and the amount of debt that we have outstanding 
although we use derivative financial instruments to manage our net exposure to financial risks  we are still exposed to interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions 
lifo charges and credits will be affected by vendor promotions and changes in the cost of inventory 
adverse weather conditions could increase the cost our suppliers charge for their products  or may decrease the customer demand for certain products 
additionally  increases in the cost of inputs  such as utility costs or raw material costs  could negatively impact financial ratios and net earnings 
although we presently operate only in the united states  civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business may affect the prices we are charged for imported goods 
if we are unable to pass these increases on to our customers  our gross margin and net earnings will suffer 
we cannot fully foresee the effects of the general economic downturn on kroger s business 
we have assumed economic and competitive situations will not change significantly for other factors and assumptions not identified above could also cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking information 
accordingly  actual events and results may vary significantly from those included in or contemplated or implied by forward looking statements made by us or our representatives 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial risk management we use derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  adverse fluctuations in commodity prices and other market risks 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
as a matter of policy  all of our derivative positions are intended to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure 
because of the high correlation between the hedging instrument and the underlying exposure  fluctuations in the value of the instruments generally are offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
the interest rate derivatives we use are straightforward instruments with liquid markets 
we manage our exposure to interest rates and changes in the fair value of our debt instruments primarily through the strategic use of variable and fixed rate debt  and interest rate swaps 
our current program relative to interest rate protection contemplates both fixing the rates on variable rate debt and hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt attributable to changes in interest rates 
to do this  we use the following guidelines i use average daily bank balance to determine annual debt amounts subject to interest rate exposure  ii limit the annual amount of debt subject to interest rate reset and the amount of floating rate debt to a combined total of billion or less  iii include no leveraged products  and iv hedge without regard to profit motive or sensitivity to current mark to market status 
as of february   we maintained seven interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling approximately  million  to manage our exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt resulting from interest rate movements by effectively converting a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
one of these agreements matured in and the remaining six agreements the old agreements matured from through in the first quarter of fiscal  we reconfigured a portion of our interest derivative portfolio by terminating the old agreements and initiating six new agreements the new agreements  with notional amounts totaling  million  maturing from through we received proceeds totaling million as a result of the termination of the old agreements 
the new agreements also effectively converted a portion of our debt from fixed to variable rates 
variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar libor 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
these agreements are accounted for as fair value hedges 
as of february   we also maintained three interest rate swap agreements  with notional amounts totaling approximately million  to manage our exposure to cash flows resulting from potential increases in interest rates by effectively converting a portion of our debt from variable to fixed rates 
these agreements  which mature in and  involve the exchange of variable rate payments for fixed rate payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts 
variable rates for our agreements are based on us dollar libor 
the differential between fixed and variable rates to be paid or received is accrued as interest rates change in accordance with the agreements and is recognized over the life of the agreements as an adjustment to interest expense 
these agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges 
annually  we review with the financial policy committee of our board of directors compliance with the guidelines 
in addition  our internal auditors review compliance with these guidelines on at least an annual basis 
the guidelines may change as our business needs dictate 
the tables below provide information about our interest rate derivatives and underlying debt portfolio as of february  the amount shown for each year represents the contractual maturities of long term debt  excluding capital leases  and the average outstanding notional amounts of interest rate derivatives as of february  interest rates reflect the weighted average for the outstanding instruments 
the variable component of each interest rate derivative and the variable rate debt is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february  the fair value column includes the fair value of our debt instruments and interest rate derivatives as of february  refer to notes  and to the consolidated financial statements expected year of maturity thereafter total fair value in millions debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate average notional amounts outstanding as of february  thereafter total fair value in millions interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate interest rate collar the table below provides an illustration of our interest rate derivatives portfolio  had the changes made to our portfolio in the first quarter of been effective as of february  the variable component of each interest rate derivative is based on us dollar libor using the forward yield curve as of february  average notional amounts outstanding adjusted thereafter total fair value in millions interest rate derivatives variable to fixed average pay rate average receive rate fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate interest rate collar the interest rate collar is reset based on the three month libor with the following impact if the three month libor is less than or equal to  we pay for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than or equal to  we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period  if the three month libor is greater than and less than  we pay for that three month period  and if the three month libor is greater than or equal to  we pay the actual interest rate for that three month period 
commodity price protection we enter into purchase commitments for various resources  including raw materials utilized in our manufacturing facilities and energy to be used in our stores  manufacturing facilities and administrative offices 
we enter into commitments expecting to take delivery of and to utilize those resources in the conduct of normal business 
those commitments for which we expect to utilize or take delivery in a reasonable amount of time in the normal course of business qualify as normal purchases and normal sales 
for any commitments for which we do not expect to take delivery and  as a result  will require net settlement  the contracts are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis 
as noted above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations significant items  we recorded a pre tax loss of million in the third quarter of to accrue liabilities for the estimated fair values of energy contracts that no longer qualified for the normal purchases and normal sales exception 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we continue to mark the excess contracts to fair value on a quarterly basis 
these liabilities had remaining balances of million as of february  if the estimates we used as of february   for future market prices for electricity were kwh higher or lower kwh represented approximately of the future prices of electricity assumed as of february   these liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately million  respectively  as of february
