item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
industry overview the energy and telecommunications industries can be expected to become increasingly competitive due to a variety of regulatory  economic and technological changes 
in the last decade  many us regulatory bodies took steps to transform the energy sectors which they regulate to encourage competition  introduce customer choice and  in some cases  to improve the operational performance of strategic energy assets 
as a result of regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels  the electric power industry has experienced and is undergoing substantial change 
as early as the mid s  new regulatory initiatives to increase competition in the domestic power generation industry were adopted or were being considered 
the primary focus of such efforts was to increase competition through the disaggregation of the traditional utility functions of generation  transmission  distribution and marketing of electricity 
these changes created new investment opportunities for competitive or partially regulated businesses to enter previously non competitive or closed markets 
the electric power industry also witnessed growing consumer demand and frequent regional shortages of electricity over the past several years 
the summers of  and and the winter of were characterized by very high peak prices for electricity in a number of recently deregulated wholesale electricity markets 
in a number of these markets  government agencies and other interested parties made proposals to delay market restructuring or even re regulate certain areas of the markets that had been previously deregulated 
the federal energy regulatory commission ferc instituted a series of price controls designed to mitigate or cap prices in the western united states and initiated numerous investigations into the western markets as a result of the california energy crisis 
these price controls contributed to the lowering of spot and forward energy prices in the western markets 
other proposals to re regulate the energy industry or to institute price controls may be made  and legislative or other actions may cause the electric power restructuring process to be delayed  discontinued or reversed in states that have already deregulated 
mild weather patterns in the summer of and winter of and the current recession mitigated most regional energy shortages 
the energy industry recently faced a financial crisis stemming from the loss of billions of dollars in market capitalization reflecting broad market conditions and investor attitudes 
investors and consumers have lost confidence in the financial health of many energy providers as a result of numerous events following the collapse of enron 
accordingly  energy companies have been subject to much greater scrutiny and significantly tighter credit standards 
companies are moving aggressively to improve liquidity and to restructure their balance sheets 
they are selling non core assets  downsizing  issuing new equity  canceling acquisitions  postponing or canceling construction projects  reducing significant levels of capital expenditures  accelerating debt repayment and realigning trading around their own generation assets 
the oil and gas industry has experienced volatile changes in commodity prices in recent years 
price increases were driven in part by several years of modest drilling activity combined with strong growth in demand for energy commodities and the threat of war in the middle east 
price decreases were driven by weather patterns  the recession and actions by opec 
natural gas is expected to remain the fuel of choice 
demand for natural gas is expected to be strong in the future as an increasing number of gas fired power plants are brought into service 
the telecommunications industry underwent widespread changes brought about by  among other things  the telecommunications act of  the decisions of federal and state regulators to open the monopolistic local telephone and cable television markets to competition  the increased consumer demand for higher speed and higher capacity networks and for expanded telecommunications services  including broader video choices and high speed data and internet services 
the convergence of these trends allowed many new entrants into the telecommunication market 
more recently the telecommunication industry suffered the effects of an economic slowdown  increased competition and financial stress 
our business strategy our long term growth strategy is to add and augment revenue streams from our diverse integrated energy operations 
we have implemented a balanced  integrated approach to fuel production  energy marketing and power generation  supported by disciplined risk management practices 
building on the strength of our electric utility  we enhanced our local operations by providing broadband communications to our customers in south dakota 
our diverse operations avoid reliance on any single business to achieve our growth objectives 
this diversity provides a measure of stability to our business and financial performance in volatile or cyclical periods 
our strategy includes the following key elements grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets and  in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development  sell a large percentage of our production from new independent power projects through long term contracts in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns  preserve our electric utility s low cost rate structure for our retail customers while retaining the flexibility to allocate excess generating capacity to maximize returns in changing market environments  increase our reserves of natural gas and crude oil and expand our fuel production  manage the risks inherent in energy marketing by maintaining position limits that minimize price risk exposure  conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to remain a low cost power producer  increase margins from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale energy customers  create a strong super local service company by capitalizing on our utility s established market presence  relationships and customer loyalty to expand our local communications business  integrating our electric and telecommunications products around the same customer base  and organize our lines of business into retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail component will consist of electric and telecommunications products in the same footprint as our electric utility exists today 
the wholesale component will consist of fuel production  marketing  mid stream assets and power production facilities 
grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets  and in particular  by expanding generating capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development 
we aim to develop power plants in regional markets based on prevailing supply and demand fundamentals in a manner that complements our existing fuel assets and fuel and energy marketing capabilities 
this approach seeks to capitalize on market growth while managing our fuel procurement needs 
over the next few years  we intend to grow through a combination of disciplined acquisitions and development of new power generation facilities primarily in the western region where we believe we have the detailed knowledge of market fundamentals and competitive advantage to achieve attractive returns 
we believe the following trends will provide us with growth opportunities in the future demand for electricity in the western regions is expected to grow and new generation capacity will be required over the next several years 
new electric generation construction will be predominantly gas fired  which may create further competitive cost advantages for new and existing coal fired generation assets 
transmission construction will significantly lag new generation development  favoring new development located near load centers or existing  unconstrained transmission locations 
disaggregation of the electric utility industry from traditionally vertically integrated utilities into separate generation  transmission  distribution and marketing entities will continue  thereby creating opportunities for acquisitions and joint ventures 
we believe that existing sites with opportunities for brownfield expansion generally offer the potential for greater returns than development of new sites through a greenfield strategy 
brownfield sites typically offer several competitive advantages over greenfield development  including proximity to existing transmission systems  operating cost advantages related to ownership of shared facilities  a less costly and time consuming permitting process  and potential ability to share infrastructure with existing facilities at the same site 
we recently expanded our capacity with brownfield development at our arapahoe and las vegas sites and are currently expanding our wyodak site 
we believe that our fountain valley  wyodak and las vegas sites in particular provide further opportunities for significant expansion of our gas and coal fired generating capacity over the next several years 
sell a large percentage of our production from new independent power projects through long term contracts in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns 
by selling the majority of our energy and capacity under mid and long term contracts  we believe that we can satisfy the requirements of our customers while earning more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling our energy into the more volatile spot markets 
approximately percent of our unregulated power generation assets are under long term contracts 
preserve our electric utility s low cost rate structure for our retail customers while retaining the flexibility to allocate excess generating capacity to maximize returns in changing market environments 
in  the south dakota public utilities commission extended our previous retail rate freeze until january  the rate freeze preserves our low cost rate structure at levels below the national average for our retail customers while allowing us to retain the benefits from cost savings and wholesale off system sales 
this provides us with flexibility in allocating our generating capacity to maximize returns in changing market environments 
we have historically optimized the utilization of our power supply resources by selling wholesale power to other utilities and to power marketers in the spot market and through short term sales contracts 
increase our reserves of natural gas and crude oil and expand our fuel production 
we aim to support the fuel requirements of our growing portfolio of power plants as well as power plants owned by others by emphasizing natural gas 
our strategy is to expand our natural gas reserves through a combination of acquisitions and drilling programs 
we aim to maintain sufficient natural gas production either to directly serve or indirectly hedge the fuel cost exposure of our gas fired generation plants 
specifically  we plan to substantially increase our natural gas reserves while minimizing exploration risk by focusing on lower risk exploration and development drilling as well as acquisitions of proven reserves  exploit opportunities based on our belief that the long term demand for natural gas will remain strong by emphasizing natural gas in our acquisition and drilling activities  and add natural gas reserves and increase production by focusing on various shallow gas plays in the rocky mountain region  where the added production can be integrated with our fuel marketing and or power generation activities 
manage the risks inherent in energy marketing by maintaining position limits that minimize price risk exposure 
our energy marketing operations require effective management of price and operational risks related to adverse changes in commodity prices and the volatility and liquidity of the commodity markets 
to mitigate these risks  we have implemented risk management policies and procedures for each of our marketing companies that establish price risk exposure levels 
we formed oversight committees to monitor compliance with our policies 
we also limit exposure to energy marketing risks by maintaining separate credit facilities for each of our marketing companies 
conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties 
our operations require effective management of counterparty credit risk 
we mitigate this risk by conducting business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties 
we accomplish this by establishment of counterparty credit limits  continuous credit monitoring  and regular review of credit compliance with our policy by our executive credit committee that reports to our board of directors 
exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to remain a low cost power producer 
we expect to expand our portfolio of power plants having relatively low marginal costs of producing energy and related products and services 
as an increasing number of gas fired power plants are brought into operation  we intend to utilize a low cost power production strategy  together with access to coal and natural gas reserves  to protect our revenue stream 
low marginal production costs can result from a variety of factors  including low fuel costs  efficiency in converting fuel into energy  and low per unit operation and maintenance costs 
we aggressively manage each of these factors to achieve very low production costs  especially at our coal fired and hydroelectric generating facilities 
our primary competitive advantage is our coal mine  which is located in close proximity to our retail service territory 
we are exploiting the competitive advantage of this native fuel source by building additional mine mouth coal fired generating capacity 
this strengthens our position as a low cost producer since transportation costs often represent the largest component of the delivered cost of coal 
increase margins from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales 
our strategy is to expand our coal production through the construction of mine mouth coal fired generation plants at our wyodak mine location 
our objective is to maintain coal reserves to serve our mine mouth coal fired generation plants directly 
specifically  we plan to increase coal production and sales from our wyodak mine by continuing to develop additional mine mouth generating facilities at the site  such as the wygen plant  which went into service in the first quarter  and pursue future sales of coal from the wyodak mine to rail served customers 
build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale energy customers 
we strive to build strong relationships with utilities  municipalities and other wholesale customers  who we believe will continue to be the primary providers of electricity to retail customers in a deregulated environment 
we further believe that these entities will need products  such as capacity  in order to serve their customers reliably 
by providing these products under long term contracts  we are able to meet our customers energy needs 
through this approach  we also believe we can earn more stable revenues and greater returns over the long term than we could by selling energy into the more volatile spot markets 
create a strong super local service company by capitalizing on our utility s established market presence  relationships and customer loyalty to expand our local communications business  integrating our electric and telecommunications products around the same customer base 
as a result of its firmly established market presence  our electric utility has built solid brand recognition and customer loyalty in the black hills region 
by ensuring a reliable supply of power to retail customers in our south dakota and wyoming service territory at rates below the national average  we have developed a strong  supportive relationship with our utility regulators 
our utility provides a solid foundation of support for the expansion of our communications businesses 
in addition  technical and market expertise from our utility and our strong brand recognition promotes rapid customer acceptance of our bundled communications services in our black hills service territory 
integrated energy our integrated energy group engages in the production of electric power through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power primarily under long term contracts  the production of coal  natural gas and crude oil primarily in the rocky mountain region  and the marketing of energy products 
the integrated energy group consists of four segments power generation  natural gas and crude oil production  coal mining and energy marketing and transportation 
power generation our power generation segment acquires  develops and expands unregulated power plants 
we hold varying interests in independent power plants in california  new york  massachusetts  wyoming  nevada and colorado with a total net ownership of megawatts in operation  including minority interests in several power related funds with a net ownership interest of megawatts 
project development program 
at december   we were in the final stages of construction of the megawatt coal fired wygen power plant at our wyodak site located near gillette  wyoming 
the wygen plant became operational in the first quarter of and is accounted for as an operating lease 
through our active acquisition and development program we are pursuing a number of additional generation projects in the early stages of development  including a coal fired mine mouth power plant with generating capacity of up to megawatts  to be located at our wyodak site near gillette  wyoming 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in completing any or all of the projects currently under consideration 
how we manage our portfolio 
we strive to maintain diversity and balance in our portfolio of regulated and unregulated power plants 
our unregulated portfolio including plants currently operating and those under construction is diversified in terms of fuel mix and geographic location  with percent of net unregulated capacity being gas fired  percent coal fired  and the remainder hydroelectric 
our independent power plants are located in california  wyoming  colorado  nevada  new york and massachusetts 
by comparison  our electric utility capacity is approximately percent coal fired  percent oil or gas fired and percent under purchased power contracts  with plants located in south dakota and wyoming 
we sell our output under contracts of varying length  thereby allowing us to mitigate the impact of a potential downturn in prices in the future 
we sell energy and capacity under a combination of short and long term contracts as well as direct sales into the energy markets 
currently  we sell approximately percent of our unregulated generating capacity in operation under contracts greater than one year in duration 
we sell the remainder of this capacity under short term contracts or directly into the power markets 
substantially all of the energy and capacity generated by our wygen plant is also under long term contracts 
how we develop and acquire power plants 
we plan to actively pursue power plant acquisitions and development opportunities in areas we view as attractive throughout north america 
our primary focus has been  and is likely to remain  in the north american electric reliability council region known as the western electricity coordinating council  or wecc 
among the factors we consider critical in evaluating the relative attractiveness of new generation opportunities are the following potential electric demand growth in the targeted region  regional generation capacity characteristics  permitting and siting requirements  proximity of the proposed site to high transmission capacity corridors  fuel supply reliability and pricing  the local regulatory environment  and the potential to exploit market expertise and operating efficiencies relating to geographic concentration of new generation with our existing power plant portfolio 
our goal is to sell approximately percent of the independent power generation portfolio under long term contracts to counterparties with investment grade credit  while reserving the remainder for merchant or spot sales 
we aim to secure long term power sales contracts in conjunction with project financing 
this structure limits our liability and establishes a debt repayment schedule to closely match the term of the power sales contracts so that at the end of the contract term  the project debt will largely be repaid 
rocky mountain and west coast facilities 
we own approximately megawatts of generating capacity in the wecc states of california  colorado  nevada and wyoming  and at december   we were in the final stages of constructing another megawatts in the region which became operational in the first quarter of all the facilities currently in operation are gas fired  and the majority are operating under long term power purchase or tolling agreements whereby the purchaser assumes the fuel price risk

as of december   we held proved reserves of million barrels of oil and billion cubic feet of natural gas  with approximately percent of current production consisting of natural gas 
in october  we entered into a definitive merger agreement with mallon resources corporation pursuant to which mallon would become our wholly owned subsidiary 
mallon is an independent energy company engaged in oil and natural gas exploration  development and production primarily in the san juan basin of new mexico 
the merger was completed on march  we expect the merger to double our existing oil and gas reserves on a bcfe  or billion cubic feet equivalent basis  and to increase our production by approximately percent over current levels 
coal mining our coal production segment mines and processes low sulfur sub bituminous coal near gillette  wyoming 
the wyodak mine  which we acquired in from homestake gold mining company  is located in the powder river basin  one of the largest coal reserves in the united states 
we produced approximately million tons of coal in mining rights to the coal are based on four federal leases and one state lease 
we pay royalties of percent and percent  respectively  of the selling price on all federal and state coal 
as of december   we had coal reserves of million tons  enough to satisfy present contracts for approximately years 
substantially all of our coal production is currently sold under long term contracts to black hills power  inc  our electric utility  and to pacificorp 
we have an additional contract to provide approximately  tons of coal per year to the wygen plant  which commenced operations in the first quarter of we also expect to increase our coal production to supply additional mine mouth generating capacity of up to megawatts at the same site as the wygen plant  which is in the early stages of development  and future sales of coal to rail served customers 
our coal segment s agreement with black hills power limits earnings from all coal sales to black hills power to a specified return on our original cost depreciated investment base 
black hills power made a commitment to the south dakota public utilities commission  the wyoming public service commission and the city of gillette that coal would be furnished and priced as provided by that agreement for the life of our neil simpson ii plant 
the price for unprocessed coal sold to pacificorp for its percent interest in the wyodak plant is determined by a coal supply agreement terminating in energy marketing and transportation we market natural gas and crude oil in specific regions of the united states

electric utility our electric utility  black hills power  is engaged in the generation  transmission and distribution of electricity 
it provides a solid foundation of revenues  earnings and cash flow that support our capital expenditures  dividends  and overall performance and growth 
distribution and transmission our electric utility distribution and transmission businesses serve approximately  electric customers  with an electric transmission system of miles of high voltage lines and miles of lower voltage lines 
in addition  we jointly own miles of high voltage lines with basin electric cooperative 
our utility s service territory covers a  square mile area of western south dakota  eastern wyoming and southeastern montana with a strong and stable economic base 
over percent of our utility s retail electric revenues are generated in south dakota 
the following are characteristics of our distribution and transmission businesses we have a diverse customer and revenue base 
our revenue mix for the year ended december  was comprised of percent commercial  percent residential  percent contract wholesale  percent wholesale off system  percent industrial and percent municipal sales and other revenue 
approximately percent of our large commercial and industrial customers are provided service under long term contracts 
we have historically optimized the utilization of our power supply resources by selling wholesale power to other utilities and to power marketers in the spot market and through short term sales contracts 
in  the south dakota public utilities commission extended our previous retail rate freeze until january  the rate freeze preserves our low cost rate structure for our retail customers at levels below the national average while allowing us to retain the benefits from cost savings and from wholesale off system sales  which are not covered by the rate freeze 
this provides us with flexibility in allocating our generating capacity to maximize returns in changing market environments 
percent of our electric revenues for the year ended december  consisted of off system and short term contract wholesale sales 
although the demand for power in the western markets has eased from the record levels seen in the first half of  we expect increases in the volume of our off system sales in the future due to demand growth in the rocky mountain region and the availability of megawatts of gas fired generating capacity which we added in our system is capable of connecting to either the eastern or western transmission systems  which provides us with access between the wecc region and the mid continent area power pool  or mapp region 
this allows us the opportunity to improve system reliability by adding voltage support and take advantage of power price differentials between the two electric grids 
we are able to interconnect up to megawatts of our generation into the mapp 
alternatively  we can serve up to megawatts of our load from the mapp region 
the available transmission capacity of the mapp transmission system determines how much of this megawatts can be served from the eastern interconnection 
we are proceeding with the construction of an ac dc ac transmission tie which is expected to be completed in late third quarter  or early fourth quarter of the transmission tie will provide us with additional load support for our utility customers and increase our ability to buy or sell electric power 
we have firm transmission access to deliver up to megawatts of power on pacificorp s system to wholesale customers in the western region during  scheduled to decline to megawatts in power sales agreements we sell approximately percent of our utility s current load under long term contracts

we introduced our broadband communications services to the rapid city and northern black hills areas in november as of december   we were serving  residential customers and  business customers 
the construction of our initial infrastructure build out  which covers rapid city and the northern black hills region  was completed in emphasis now will be focused on efficiencies  both internal to our communications group and those that can be realized through our strategy as a super local service company 
competition the independent power  fuel production and energy marketing industries are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors  some of which may have more extensive operating experience  larger staffs or greater financial resources than us 
ferc has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non utility purchasers and sellers of electricity 
in addition  a number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition 
industry deregulation in some states has led to the disaggregation of some vertically integrated utilities into separate generation  transmission and distribution businesses  and deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation 
however  the pace of restructuring slowed significantly following public and governmental reactions to issues associated with deregulation efforts in california and the collapse of its wholesale electric energy market 
in addition  congress is considering various legislative proposals to restructure the electric industry that would require  among other things  customer choice and or repeal of the public utility holding company act of  or puhca 
the debate is likely to continue and perhaps intensify 
the effect of enacting such legislation cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty 
as a result of these potential regulatory changes  significant additional competitors could become active in the generation segment of our industry 
our communications unit faces strong competition from several companies  including qwest corporation  rapid city s incumbent local exchange carrier and midcontinent communications  the area s incumbent cable television provider  as well as long distance providers and internet service providers 
our success in this business will depend upon  among other things  the quality of our customer service  the willingness of residential and business customers to accept us as an alternative provider of broadband communications products and services and our ability to offer an attractive package of bundled products 
risk management our business operations require effective management of price  counterparty performance and operational risks 
price risk arises from the volatility of energy prices 
counterparty performance risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to satisfy its contractual obligations to us  and includes credit risk 
operational risk is the risk that we will be unable to perform on our contractual obligations to our counterparties 
we have implemented controls to mitigate each of these risks 
our energy marketing operations are conducted in accordance with guidelines established through separate risk management policies and procedures for each marketing company and through our credit policy and procedures 
these policies and procedures specify maximum price risk exposure levels within which each respective marketing company must operate 
they establish relatively low exposure levels and generally prohibit speculative trading strategies 
these policies are established and approved by our board of directors  reviewed on a regular basis and monitored as described below 
we maintain a working risk management committee that oversees each of our marketing companies  and a credit committee at the parent company level 
the risk management committee focuses on implementation of risk management procedures and on monitoring compliance with established policies 
the credit committee monitors credit exposure levels and reviews compliance with established credit policies 
our vice president risk is responsible for overseeing these functions 
we limit the exposure of our parent holding company  black hills corporation  to energy marketing risks by maintaining separate credit facilities within each of our energy marketing companies 
these credit facilities have security interests solely against the assets of the respective marketing company 
in addition  we limit the number and amount of any parent guarantees for the marketing companies 
a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risks  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
regulation we are subject to a broad range of federal  state and local energy and environmental laws and regulations applicable to the development  ownership and operation of our projects 
these laws and regulations generally require that a wide variety of permits and other approvals be obtained before construction or operation of a power plant commences and that  after completion  the facility operate in compliance with such requirements 
we strive to comply with the terms of all such laws  regulations  permits and licenses and believe that all of our operating plants are in material compliance with all such applicable requirements 
energy regulation federal power act 
the federal power act gives ferc exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce 
pursuant to the federal power act  all public utilities subject to ferc s jurisdiction are required to file rate schedules with ferc prior to commencement of wholesale sales or interstate transmission of electricity 
public utilities with cost based rate schedules are also subject to accounting  record keeping and reporting requirements administered by ferc 
the energy policy act 
the passage of the energy policy act in further encouraged independent power production by providing certain exemptions from regulation for exempt wholesale generators  or ewgs 
an ewg is an entity that is exclusively engaged  directly or indirectly  in the business of owning or operating facilities that are exclusively engaged in generation and selling electric energy at wholesale 
an ewg will not be regulated under puhca  but is subject to ferc and state public utility commission regulatory reviews  including rate approval 
since ewgs are only allowed to sell power at wholesale  their rates must receive initial approval from ferc rather than from the state regulators 
all of our subsidiaries that would otherwise be treated as public utilities are currently treated as ewgs under the energy policy act or as qualifying facilities qfs under the public utility regulatory policies act of purpa 
all of our ewgs have been granted market based rate authority  which allows ferc to waive certain accounting  record keeping and reporting requirements imposed on public utilities with cost based rates 
however  ferc customarily reserves the right to suspend  upon complaint  market based rate authority on a prospective basis if it is subsequently determined that we or any of our ewgs exercised market power 
if ferc were to suspend market based rate authority  we would most likely be required to file  and obtain ferc acceptance of  cost based rate schedules for our affected ewgs 
also  the loss of market based rate authority would subject the ewgs to the accounting  record keeping and reporting requirements that are imposed on public utilities with cost based rate schedules 
in addition  if there occurs a material change in facts that might affect any of our subsidiaries eligibility for ewg status  within days of the material change  the relevant ewg must file a written explanation of why the material change does not affect its ewg status  file a new application for ewg status  or notify ferc that it no longer wishes to maintain ewg status 
if any of our subsidiaries were to lose ewg status  we  along with our affiliates  would be subject to regulation under puhca as a public utility company 
absent a substantial restructuring of our business  it would be difficult for us to comply with puhca without a material adverse effect on our business 
purpa 
the enactment of purpa in provided incentives for the development of qfs which were basically cogeneration facilities and small power production facilities that utilized certain alternative or renewable fuels 
qf status conveys two primary benefits 
first  regulations under purpa exempt qfs from puhca  most provisions of the federal power act and the state laws concerning rates  and financial and organizational regulations of electric utilities 
second  ferc s regulations under purpa require that electric utilities purchase electricity generated by qfs at a price based on the purchasing utility s full avoided cost of producing power  the electric utilities must sell back up  interruptible  maintenance and supplemental power to the qf on a non discriminatory basis  and the electric utilities must interconnect with any qf in its service territory  and  if required  transmit power if they do not purchase it 
we endeavor to acquire  develop and operate our qfs in a manner that minimizes the risk of those plants losing their qf status 
however  if a facility were to lose qf status  we could attempt to avoid regulation under puhca by qualifying the project as an ewg 
state energy regulation 
in areas outside of wholesale rate regulation such as financial or organizational regulation  some state utility laws may give their public utility commissions broad jurisdiction over steam sales or ewgs that sell power in their service territories 
the actual scope of the jurisdiction over steam or independent power projects depends on state law and varies significantly from state to state 
environmental regulation the construction and operation of power projects are subject to extensive environmental protection and land use regulation in the united states 
these laws and regulations often require a lengthy and complex process of obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from federal  state and local agencies 
if such laws and regulations are changed and our facilities are not grandfathered  extensive modifications to project technologies and facilities could be required 
general 
based on current trends  we expect that environmental and land use regulation will continue to be stringent 
accordingly  we actively review proposed construction projects that could subject us to stringent pollution controls imposed on major modifications  as defined under the clean air act  and changes in discharge characteristics  as defined under the clean water act 
the goal of these actions is to achieve compliance with applicable regulations  administrative consent orders and variances from applicable air quality related regulations 
air quality 
our neil simpson ii  neil simpson ct  gillette ct  arapahoe  valmont  fountain valley  lange ct and wyodak plants are all subject to title iv of the clean air act  which requires certain fossil fuel fired combustion devices to hold sulfur dioxide allowances for each ton of sulfur dioxide emitted 
we currently hold sufficient allowances credited to us as a result of sulfur removal equipment previously installed at the wyodak plant to apply to the operation of all units subject to title iv through without requiring the purchase of any additional allowances 
with respect to any future plants  we plan to comply with the need for holding the appropriate number of allowances by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions through the use of low sulfur fuels  installation of back end control technology and if necessary  the purchase of allowances on the open market 
we expect to integrate the costs of obtaining the required number of allowances needed for future projects into our overall financial analysis of such projects 
our subsidiary  black hills ontario  the operator of a megawatt natural gas fired cogeneration facility located in ontario  california  projects that it will need to continue purchasing nox allowances for all future compliance years 
annual purchases are anticipated to be approximately  allowances 
there is currently significant volatility in the price and supply of regional clean air incentives market reclaim nox allowances  although the south coast air quality management district scaqmd has proposed a revision to its regulations to stabilize the reclaim market  it is unclear whether these rules will mitigate black hills ontario s potential exposure for its projected allowance shortfall 
accordingly  no assurance can be given at this time regarding whether reclaim nox allowances will be available for purchase to allow black hills ontario to comply with reclaim requirements for the year ended june   or  if allowances are available  as to the cost of those allowances 
in july  the united states environmental protection agency epa finalized rules designed to protect and improve visibility impairment resulting from air emissions 
among other things  the regulations required states to identify sources of emissions including certain coal fired generating units built between and by that would be subject to best available retrofit technology  known as bart 
these sources would be required to implement bart within five years after the epa approved state plans adopted to combat visibility impairment 
subsequent litigation has removed epa s requirement mandating that states adopt and impose bart requirements  however  it remains an option for states to use in addressing visibility impairment 
management believes the only existing plant which may be required to comply with the bart requirements is our neil simpson i plant in wyoming 
at the present time  the state of wyoming is moving away from bart and is requesting legislative approval for an emissions trading program 
legislative approval will be followed by regulation development and therefore applicability and subsequent requirements are uncertain at this time 
we are aware that currently  states are required to submit their visibility impairment plans to epa between and and that compliance is due within five years of epa approval 
management believes that any capital expenditures associated with future compliance requirements would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
title v of the clean air act imposes federal requirements  which dictate that all of our fossil fuel fired generation facilities must obtain operating permits 
all of our existing facilities subject to this requirement are in the process of or have submitted title v permit applications and either have received or are in the process of receiving permits 
on november   the united states department of justice filed suit against a number of electric utilities for alleged violations of the clean air act s new source review requirements related to modifications of air emissions sources at electric generating stations located in the southern and midwestern regions of the united states 
several states joined these lawsuits 
in addition  the epa has also issued administrative notices of violation alleging similar violations at additional power plants owned by some of the same utilities named as defendants in the department of justice lawsuit 
the epa has also issued requests for information pursuant to the clean air act to numerous other electric utilities seeking to determine whether those utilities also engaged in activities that may have been in violation of the clean air act s new source review requirements 
no such proceedings have been initiated or requests for information issued with respect to any of our facilities  but there can be no assurance that we will not be subject to similar proceedings in the future 
in december  the epa announced its intention to regulate mercury emissions from coal fired and oil fired electric power plants under section of the clean air act 
the epa is committed to proposing a rule to regulate such emissions by no later than december because we do not know what the epa may require with respect to this issue  we are not able to evaluate the impact of potential mercury regulations on the operation of our facilities 
since the adoption of the united nations framework on climate change in  there has been worldwide attention with respect to greenhouse gas emissions 
in december  the clinton administration participated in the kyoto  japan negotiations  where the basis of a climate change treaty was formulated 
under the treaty  known as the kyoto protocol  the united states would be required  between and to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by percent from levels 
however  because of opposition to the treaty in the united states senate  the kyoto protocol has not been submitted to the senate for ratification 
although legislative developments on the state level related to controlling greenhouse gas emissions have occurred  we are not aware of any similar developments in the states in which we operate 
if the united states ratifies the kyoto protocol or we otherwise become subject to limitations on emissions of carbon dioxide from our plants  these requirements could have a significant impact on our operations 
clean water act 
our existing facilities are also subject to a variety of state and federal regulations governing existing and potential water wastewater discharges 
generally  such regulations are promulgated under authority of the clean water act and govern overall water wastewater discharges through national pollutant discharge elimination system  or npdes  permits 
under current provisions of the clean water act  existing npdes permits must be renewed every five years  at which time permit limits are extensively reviewed and can be modified to account for changes in regulations or program initiatives 
in addition  the permits have re opener clauses which allow the permitting authority which may be the united states or an authorized state to attempt to modify a permit to conform to changes in applicable laws and regulations 
some of our existing facilities have been operating under npdes permits for many years and have gone through one or more npdes permit renewal cycles 
all of our facilities required to have npdes permits have those permits in place and are in compliance with discharge limitations 
there are no proposed regulations that we are aware of that will have a significant impact on our operations 
solid waste disposal 
we dispose of all solid wastes collected as a result of burning coal at our power plants in approved solid waste disposal sites 
each disposal site has been permitted by the state of its location in compliance with law 
ash and wastes from flue gas and sulfur removal from the wyodak and neil simpson ii plants are deposited in mined areas 
these disposal areas are located below some shallow water aquifers in the mine 
none of the solid wastes from the burning of coal is classified as hazardous material  but the wastes do contain minute traces of metals that would be perceived as polluting if such metals were leached into underground water 
recent investigations have concluded that the wastes are relatively insoluble and will not measurably affect the post mining ground water quality 
while management does not believe that any substances from our solid waste disposal activities will pollute underground water  we can give no assurance that pollution will not occur over time 
in this event  we could experience material costs to mitigate any resulting damages 
agreements in place require pacificorp to be responsible for any such costs that would be related to the solid waste from its percent interest in the wyodak plant 
additional unexpected material costs could also result in the future if any regulator determines that solid waste from the burning of coal contains some hazardous material that requires special treatment  including solid waste of which we previously disposed 
in that event  the government regulator could consequently hold those entities that disposed of such waste responsible for such treatment 
mine reclamation 
under federal and state laws and regulations  we are required to submit to the regulation by  and receive approval from  the wyoming department of environmental quality deq for a mining and reclamation plan which provides for orderly mining  reclamation and restoration of our entire wyodak coal mine in conformity with state laws and regulations 
we have an approved mining permit and are otherwise in compliance with other land quality permitting programs 
based on extensive reclamation studies  we have accrued approximately million on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets for these reclamation costs 
no assurance can be given that additional requirements in the future will not be imposed that would cause an unexpected material increase in reclamation costs 
one situation that could result in substantial unexpected increases in costs relating to our reclamation permit concerns three depressions the south depression  the peerless depression and the north pit depression that have or will result from our mining activities at the wyodak mine 
because of the thick coal seam and relatively shallow overburden  the current restoration plan would leave these depressions  which have limited reclamation potential  with interior drainage only 
although the deq has accepted the current plan to limit reclamation of these depressions  it has reserved the right to review and evaluate future reclamation plans or to reevaluate the existing reclamation plan 
if as a result of our mining activities  additional overburden becomes available  the deq may require us to conduct additional reclamation of the depressions  particularly if the deq finds that the current limited reclamation is resulting in exceedances in the deq s water quality standards 
ben french oil spill 
in and  we discovered extensive underground fuel oil contamination at the ben french plant site 
with the help of expert consultants  we worked closely with the south dakota department of environment and natural resources to assess and remediate the site 
our assessment and remediation efforts continue today and we continue to monitor the site 
all of our underground oil carrying facilities from which the contamination occurred are now above ground 
there have been no significant recoveries of free fuel oil product since soil borings and monitoring wells on the perimeters of our ben french plant property provide no indication of contamination beyond the property s limits 
management believes that the underground spill has been sufficiently remedied so as to prevent any oil from migrating off site 
however  due to underground gypsum deposits in this area  the fuel oil has the potential of migrating to area waterways 
in such event  cleanup costs could be greatly increased 
management believes that sufficient remediation efforts to prevent such a migration are currently in place  but due to the uncertainties of underground geology  no assurance can be given 
cleanup costs recognized to date total approximately million  of which amount million has been reimbursed by the south dakota petroleum release compensation fund 
to date  no penalties  claims or actions have been taken or threatened against us because of this oil spill 
in  the south dakota department of environment and natural resources permanently closed numerous monitoring wells which showed no contamination for several years 
pcbs 
under the federal toxic substances control act  the epa has issued regulations that control the use and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls  or pcbs 
pcbs were widely used as insulating fluids in many electric utility transformers and capacitors manufactured before the toxic substances control act prohibited any further manufacture of pcb equipment 
we remove and dispose of pcb contaminated equipment in compliance with law as it is discovered 
release of pcb contaminated fluids  especially any involving a fire or a release into a waterway  could result in substantial cleanup costs 
several years ago  we began a testing program of potential pcb contaminated transformers  and in completed testing of all transformers and capacitors which are not located in our electric substations 
we have not completed the testing of sealed potential transformers and bushings located in our electric substations as the testing of this equipment requires their destruction 
release of pcb contaminated fluid  if present  from our equipment is unlikely and the volume of fluid in such equipment is generally less than one gallon 
moreover  any release of this fluid would be confined to our substation site 
exploration and production our oil and gas exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
they include requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  submitting and implementing spill prevention plans  submitting notification relating to the presence  use and release of certain contaminants incidental to oil and gas operations  regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the use  transportation  storage and disposal of fluids and materials used in connection with drilling and production activities  and regulating surface usage and the restoration of properties upon which wells have been drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells and the transporting of production 
our operations are also subject to various conservation matters  including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the number of wells which may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties 
in this regard  some states allow the forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases  which may make it more difficult to develop oil and gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratable purchase of production 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amounts of oil and gas we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill 
in addition  various federal  state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment  the generation  storage  transportation and disposal of contaminants and the protection of public health  natural resources  wildlife and environment affect our exploration  development and production operations and our related costs 
other properties in addition to the other properties described herein  we own an eight story office building with approximately  square feet  of which we occupy approximately percent and lease the remainder to others 
we also own two additional office buildings consisting of approximately  square feet and two warehouse buildings consisting of approximately  square feet 
all of these properties are located in rapid city  south dakota 
employees at december   we had employees  approximately of whom are employed in our utility business  of whom are employed in our integrated energy businesses  of whom are employed in our communications business and of whom are employed at the corporate level 
approximately one half of our utility employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the international brotherhood of electrical workers  which expires on march  we have experienced no labor stoppages or significant labor disputes at our facilities 
risk factors the following specific risk factors and other risk factors that we discuss in our periodic reports from time to time should be considered for a better understanding of our company 
these factors and other matters discussed herein are important factors that could cause our actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements included elsewhere in this document 
our agreements with counterparties that have recently experienced downgrades in their credit ratings expose us to the risk of counterparty default  which could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
we are exposed to credit risks in our generation  distribution and energy marketing operations 
credit risk includes the risk that counterparties that owe us money or energy will breach their obligations 
in recent months  a substantial number of energy companies have experienced downgrades in their credit ratings  some of which serve as our counterparties from time to time 
in particular  the credit ratings of the senior unsecured debt of public service company of colorado  nevada power company and allegheny energy supply company aesc  counterparties under power purchase agreements with our subsidiaries  have recently been downgraded by one or more rating agencies 
the credit ratings of nevada power company and aesc were downgraded to non investment grade status 
in addition  we have project level financing arrangements in place that provide for the potential acceleration of payment obligations in the event of nonperformance by a counterparty under related power purchase agreements 
if these or other counterparties fail to perform their obligations under their respective power purchase agreements  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to enter into replacement power purchase agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements  or at all  in which case we would sell the plant s power on a merchant basis 
we have substantial indebtedness  much of which is short term 
we will require significant amounts of debt or equity capital in order to refinance or repay maturing indebtedness as it becomes due and to grow our business 
our future access to these funds is not certain  and our inability to access funds in the future could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to implement our business strategy 
as of december   we had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately million  of which approximately million will mature before december  our substantial indebtedness may limit our ability to borrow funds or increase the cost to borrow additional funds  hinder our ability to pay dividends at the current rate  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay our debt  which would reduce funds available for us to finance our current operations and for our future business opportunities  have a negative impact on our credit ratings  increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors having less debt  or require us to sell assets in order to repay debt 
some of our debt agreements contain restrictive covenants  including restrictive financial covenants pertaining to our recourse debt to capitalization ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and total level of equity 
if we fail to maintain these specified ratios and levels  our ability to borrow funds could be further limited 
if our failure to maintain those ratios and levels were to persist  the creditors under those debt agreements could eventually require us to immediately repay the entire balance of those outstanding loans 
our credit ratings have recently been lowered and could be further lowered in the future 
if this were to occur  our access to capital and our cost of capital and other costs would be negatively affected 
our issuer credit rating was recently downgraded to baa by moody s investor services  inc  or moody s 
any further reduction in our ratings by moody s or standard poor s rating service  particularly a reduction to a level below investment grade  could adversely affect our ability to refinance or repay our existing debt and to complete new financings 
in addition  a further downgrade in our credit rating would increase our costs of borrowing under some of our existing debt obligations  including borrowings made under our million three year and million day revolving credit facilities  our million term loan  our million project credit agreement  and our million and million secured financings 
a downgrade in our credit rating would also result in an increase in the operating lease costs related to our wygen plant lease 
a downgrade could also result in our business counterparties requiring us to provide additional amounts of collateral under new transactions  particularly transactions pertaining to our energy marketing activities 
we must rely on cash from our subsidiaries to make debt payments 
there may be changes in the regulatory environment that restrict our utility s ability to pay dividends to us 
we are a holding company and thus our investments in our subsidiaries are our primary assets 
consequently  our operating cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness depends upon the operating cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by them to us in the form of dividends or advances 
our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available for that purpose  whether by dividends or otherwise 
in addition  each subsidiary s ability to pay dividends to us depends on any contractual or regulatory restrictions that may be applicable to it  which may include requirements to maintain minimum levels of cash or working capital 
our utility is regulated by various state utility commissions which generally possess broad powers to ensure that the needs of the utility customers are being met 
as a result of the energy crisis in california and the financial troubles at a number of energy companies  some state utility commissions may seek to impose restrictions on the ability of our utility subsidiary to pay dividends or make advances to us 
if successful  this could materially and adversely affect our ability to meet our financial obligations 
geopolitical tensions  including the armed conflict in iraq  may impair our ability to raise capital and limit our growth 
an extended conflict with iraq or an increase in tensions with the government of north korea could temporarily disrupt capital markets and make it more costly or temporarily impossible for us to raise capital  thus hampering the implementation of our growth strategy 
in the past  geopolitical events  including the uncertainty associated with the gulf war in and the terrorist attacks of september   have been associated with general economic slowdowns 
a prolonged conflict or stalemate arising from current geopolitical tensions or other factors could retard economic growth and reduce demand for the power and fuel products that we produce or market  which could adversely affect our earnings 
our rate freeze agreement with the south dakota public utilities commission  which prevents us  absent extraordinary circumstances  from passing on to our south dakota retail customers cost increases we may incur during the rate freeze period  could decrease our operating margins 
our rate freeze agreement with the south dakota public utilities commission is effective until january  we may not file for any increase in our rates or invoke any fuel and purchased power adjustment tariff which would take effect during the freeze period  except in extraordinary circumstances 
because we are generally unable to increase our rates  our utility s historically stable returns could be threatened by plant outages  machinery failure  increases in purchased power costs over which we have no control  acts of nature  acts of terrorism or other unexpected events that could cause our operating costs to increase and our operating margins to decline 
moreover  in the event of unexpected plant outages or machinery failures  we may be required to purchase replacement power in wholesale power markets at prices which exceed the rates we are permitted to charge our retail customers 
because prices for our products and services and other operating costs for our business are volatile  our revenues and expenses may fluctuate 
a substantial portion of our growth in net income in recent years is attributable to increasing wholesale electricity and natural gas sales into a robust market 
the prices of energy products in the wholesale power markets have declined significantly since the first half of power prices are influenced by many factors outside our control  including fuel prices  transmission constraints  supply and demand  weather  economic conditions  and the rules  regulations and actions of the system operators in those markets 
moreover  unlike most other commodities  electricity cannot be stored and therefore must be produced concurrently with its use 
as a result  wholesale power markets are subject to significant price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable 
the success of our oil and gas operations will depend somewhat upon the prevailing market prices of oil and natural gas 
historically  oil and natural gas prices and markets have also been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
a decrease in oil or natural gas prices will not only reduce revenues and profits  but will also reduce the quantities of reserves that are commercially recoverable and may result in charges to earnings for impairment of the value of these assets 
oil and natural gas prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
a decline in fuel price volatility could also affect our revenues and returns from energy marketing  which historically tend to increase when markets are volatile 
our broadband communications business is subject to significant competition for its services and to rapid technological change 
our communications group  which provides a full suite of communication services  faces strong competition for its services from the incumbent local exchange carrier and from long distance providers  internet service providers  the incumbent cable television provider and others 
our ability to recover our capital investment is dependent on our ability to sustain our customer base and is subject to the risk that technological advances may render our network obsolete 
if we determine that we will be unable to recover our investment  we would be required to take a non cash charge to earnings in an amount that could be material in order to write down a portion of our investment in our broadband communications business 
construction  expansion  refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource recovery facilities involve significant risks which could lead to lost revenues or increased expenses 
the construction  expansion  refurbishment and operation of power generating and transmission and resource recovery facilities involve many risks  including the inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals  the unavailability of equipment  supply interruptions  work stoppages  labor disputes  social unrest  weather interferences  unforeseen engineering  environmental and geological problems  and unanticipated cost overruns 
the ongoing operation of our facilities involves all of the risks described above  in addition to risks relating to the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
new plants may employ recently developed and technologically complex equipment  especially in the case of newer environmental emission control technology 
any of these risks could cause us to operate below expected capacity levels  which in turn could result in lost revenues  increased expenses  higher maintenance costs and penalties 
while we maintain insurance obtain warranties from vendors and obligate contractors to meet certain performance levels  the proceeds of such insurance  and our rights under warranties or performance guarantees may not be adequate to cover lost revenues  increased expenses or liquidated damage payments 
our power project development  expansion and acquisition activities may not be successful  which would impair our ability to execute our growth strategy 
the growth of our independent power business through development  expansion and acquisition activities is critical to our future growth 
we may not be able to continue to develop attractive opportunities or to complete acquisitions or development projects we undertake 
factors that could cause our activities to be unsuccessful include competition  changes in federal or state laws and regulations  our inability to negotiate acceptable acquisition  construction  fuel supply or other material agreements  our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms  our inability to obtain required governmental permits and approvals  capital market conditions  and our inability to successfully integrate any businesses we acquire 
estimates of the quantity and value of our proved reserves may change materially due to numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating oil and natural gas reserves 
there are many uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and their values 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretations and judgment  and the assumptions used regarding quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves and prices for oil and natural gas 
actual prices  production  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates  and these variances may be significant 
any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates in our reported reserves 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production and changes in oil and natural gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in substantial upward or downward revisions 
our business is subject to substantial governmental regulation and permitting requirements as well as on site environmental liabilities we assumed when we acquired some of our facilities 
we may be adversely affected by any future inability to comply with existing or future regulations or requirements or the potentially high cost of complying with such requirements 
our business is subject to extensive energy  environmental and other laws and regulations of federal  state and local authorities 
we generally are required to obtain and comply with a wide variety of licenses  permits and other approvals in order to operate our facilities 
in the course of complying with these requirements  we may incur significant additional costs 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  we could be subject to civil or criminal liability and the imposition of liens or fines 
in addition  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in laws and regulation may have a detrimental effect on our business 
in acquiring some of our facilities  we assumed on site liabilities associated with the environmental condition of those facilities  regardless of when such liabilities arose and whether known or unknown  and in some cases agreed to indemnify the former owners of those facilities for on site environmental liabilities 
we strive at all times to be in compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  steps to bring our facilities into compliance  if necessary  could be expensive  and thus could adversely affect our results of operation and financial condition 
furthermore  with the continuing trends toward stricter standards  greater regulation  more extensive permitting requirements and an increase in the assets we operate  we expect our environmental expenditures to be substantial in the future 
one of our subsidiaries may incur material liabilities due to a prior owner s potential violation of regulations for qualifying facilities under purpa 
in august  we purchased a partnership interest in the megawatt las vegas cogeneration facility from an affiliate of enron 
the partnership is called las vegas cogeneration  lp the prior owner certified to us and to relevant governmental authorities that the facility complied with all regulations necessary to obtain and maintain qualifying facility status under purpa 
qualifying facilities are allowed to sell their output to electric utilities at avoided cost rates  which are usually higher than prevailing market based rates 
the prior owner contracted with nevada power company to sell megawatts of the facility s output during the periods of peak electricity consumption at avoided cost rates 
in connection with acquiring the facility  we assumed this contract 
recently ferc issued an order announcing an investigation to determine whether enron s ownership of the las vegas cogeneration facility violated the qualifying facility regulations under purpa 
in addition  the sec recently issued an initial decision concluding that enron is an electric utility and is thus not exempt from regulations under puhca  that  among other things  prohibit electric utilities from owning more than percent of a qualifying facility 
enron is appealing this decision 
the ferc investigation does not relate to the megawatt gas fired facility owned and operated by las vegas cogeneration ii  llc  and located on the same site in north las vegas  nevada 
this facility is not now  and never was certified as a qualifying facility under purpa 
if ferc determines that enron violated the qualifying facility rules with respect to the las vegas cogeneration facility  we  as a partner in the entity that now owns that facility  could be liable for any refunds  fines or other penalties ferc imposes 
we could also be subject to additional liabilities resulting from third party claims 
we have the right to seek indemnification from the prior owner 
while the prior owner does not appear among the enron subsidiaries and affiliates currently in bankruptcy  the enron bankruptcy could impair our ability to enforce a claim for indemnification 
because ferc has only recently begun its investigation  we cannot predict the outcome of ferc s investigation 
we face potential claims related to forest fires in south dakota in and in september a fire occurred in the southwestern black hills 
it is alleged that the fire occurred when a high voltage electrical span maintained by our electric utility subsidiary broke and electrical arcing from the severed line ignited dry grass 
the fire burned approximately  acres of land owned by the black hills national forest  the oglala sioux tribe and other private landowners 
the state of south dakota initiated litigation against us in the seventh judicial circuit court  fall river county  south dakota  on or about january  the complaint seeks recovery of damages for alleged injury to timber  fire suppression and rehabilitation costs 
a claim for treble damages is asserted with respect to the claim for injury to timber 
it is expected that substantially similar claims will be asserted against us by the united states forest service 
our investigation into the cause and origin of the fire is still pending 
the total amount of damages claimed by the state of south dakota is not specified in the complaint 
we have denied all claims and will vigorously defend this matter 
in june  the grizzly gulch forest fire damaged approximately  acres of private and governmental land located near deadwood and lead  south dakota 
the fire destroyed approximately structures and caused the evacuation of the cities of lead and deadwood for approximately hours 
the cause of the grizzly gulch fire was investigated by the state of south dakota 
alleged contact between power lines owned by our electric utility subsidiary and undergrowth was implicated as the cause 
we have initiated our own investigation into the cause of the fire  including the hiring of expert fire investigators and that investigation is continuing 
we have been notified of potential private civil claims for property damage and business loss 
in addition  the state of south dakota initiated a civil action in the seventh judicial circuit court  pennington county  south dakota  seeking recovery of damages for fire suppression  reclamation and remediation costs  and treble damages for injury to trees 
the united states government initiated a civil action in us district court  district of south dakota  asserting similar claims 
neither the state of south dakota nor the united states specified the amount of their alleged damages 
if it is determined that power line contact was the cause of the fire and that we were negligent in the maintenance of those power lines  we could be liable for resultant damages 
although we cannot predict the outcome of our investigations or the viability of potential claims based on information currently available  management believes that any such claims  if determined adversely to us  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
ongoing changes in the united states utility industry  such as state and federal regulatory changes  a potential increase in the number of our competitors or the imposition of price limitations to address market volatility  could adversely affect our profitability 
the united states electric utility industry is currently experiencing increasing competitive pressures as a result of consumer demands  technological advances  deregulation  greater availability of natural gas fired power generation  and other factors 
ferc has implemented and continues to propose regulatory changes to increase access to the nationwide transmission grid by utility and non utility purchasers and sellers of electricity 
in addition  a number of states have implemented or are considering or currently implementing methods to introduce and promote retail competition 
industry deregulation in some states has led to the disaggregation of some vertically integrated utilities into separate generation  transmission and distribution businesses  and deregulation initiatives in a number of states may encourage further disaggregation 
as a result  significant additional competitors could become active in the generation  transmission and distribution segments of our industry 
in addition  the independent system operators who oversee most of the wholesale power markets have in the past imposed  and may in the future continue to impose  price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the volatility in these markets 
these types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely affect the profitability of those generating facilities that sell energy into the wholesale power markets 
given the extreme volatility and lack of meaningful long term price history in some of these markets and the imposition of price limitations by independent system operators  we may not be able to operate profitably in all wholesale power markets

our unregulated and regulated businesses have expanded significantly in recent years 
our integrated energy group  black hills energy  inc  engages in the production of electric power through ownership of a diversified portfolio of generating plants and the sale of electric power and capacity primarily under long term contracts  the production of coal  natural gas and crude oil primarily in the rocky mountain region  and the marketing and transportation of fuel products 
the integrated energy group consists of four segments power generation  oil and gas exploration and production  coal mining and energy marketing and transportation 
our electric utility  black hills power  inc  generates  transmits and distributes electricity to approximately  customers in south dakota  wyoming and montana 
our communications group provides broadband telecommunication services to over  residential and business customers in rapid city and the northern black hills region of south dakota through black hills fibercom  llc 
in  we discontinued operations of our coal marketing business due to difficulties in marketing our wyodak coal from the powder river basin of wyoming to east coast markets 
the non strategic assets were sold effective august  business strategy our long term growth strategy is to add and augment revenue streams from our diverse integrated energy operations 
we have implemented a balanced  integrated approach to fuel production  energy marketing and power generation  supported by disciplined risk management practices 
building on the strength of our electric utility  we have enhanced our local operations by providing broadband communications to our customers in south dakota 
our diverse operations avoid reliance on any single element to achieve our growth objective 
this diversity provides a measure of stability in volatile or cyclical periods 
prospective information we continue to advance our ongoing business strategy 
we expect long term growth through the expansion of integrated  balanced and diverse competitive energy operations supplemented by the strength and stability of our electric utility and improving results from our communication business 
we recognize that sustained growth requires continued capital deployment  particularly in our integrated energy operations 
we strongly believe that we are strategically positioned to take advantage of opportunities to acquire and develop energy assets consistent with our prudent investment criteria and consistent with a prudent capitalization structure 
our strategy includes the following key elements grow our power generation segment by developing and acquiring power generating assets in targeted western markets and  in particular  by expanding the generation capacity of our existing sites through a strategy known as brownfield development  sell a large percentage of our production from new independent power projects through long term contracts in order to secure a stable revenue stream and attractive returns  preserve our electric utility s low cost rate structure for our retail customers while retaining the flexibility to allocate excess generating capacity to maximize returns in changing market environments  increase our reserves of natural gas and crude oil and expand our fuel production  manage the risks inherent in energy marketing by maintaining position limits that minimize price risk exposure  conduct business with a diversified group of creditworthy counterparties  exploit our fuel cost advantages and our operating and marketing expertise to remain a low cost power producer  increase margins from our coal production through an expansion of mine mouth generation and increased coal sales  build and maintain strong relationships with wholesale energy customers  create a strong super local service company by capitalizing on our utility s established market presence  relationships and customer loyalty to expand our local communications business  integrating our electric and telecommunication products around the same customer base  and organize our lines of business into retail and wholesale energy components 
the retail component will consist of electric and telecommunications products in the same footprint as our electric utility exists today 
the wholesale component will consist of fuel production  marketing  mid stream assets and power production facilities 
our integrated energy group was our largest contributor to revenue and earnings in and we expect that earnings from this group over the next few years will be driven primarily by our continued expansion in the power generation and oil and gas production segments 
in october  we entered into a definitive merger agreement with mallon resources corporation to acquire mallon 
mallon is an energy company engaged in oil and natural gas exploration  development and production primarily in the san juan basin of new mexico 
the merger was completed in march and is expected to double our oil and gas reserves  and increase our production by approximately percent over current levels 
although we believe our integrated energy group will continue to grow as our largest business group  we cannot predict the price environment  regulation or growth in the energy markets 
our electric utility s retail business remained healthy in  even though two of our largest and oldest customers  the homestake mining company and federal beef processors  discontinued operations in we believe that our electric utility will produce modest growth in revenue  and absent unplanned plant outages  it will continue to produce modest growth in earnings for the next several years due to the extension of our electric utility s rate freeze until january  see rate regulation 
we forecast firm energy sales in our retail service territory to increase over the next years at an annual compound growth rate of approximately one percent  with the system demand forecasted to increase at a rate of two percent 
these forecasts are derived from studies conducted by us whereby we examined and analyzed our service territory to estimate changes in the needs for electrical energy and demand over a year period 
these forecasts are only estimates  and the actual changes in electric sales may be substantially different 
weather deviations can also affect energy sales significantly when compared to forecasts based on normal weather 
the portion of the utility s future earnings that will result from wholesale off system sales will depend on many factors  including native load growth  plant availability  electricity demand and commodity prices in the western markets 
although our broadband communications business significantly increased residential and business customers in  we expect it will sustain approximately to million in net losses in  with profitability expected in the recovery of capital investment and future profitability are dependent primarily on our ability to sustain our customer base and control expenses  and is subject to the risk that technological advances may render our network obsolete 
if we determine that we will be unable to recover our investment  we would be required to take a non cash charge to earnings in an amount that could be material in order to write down a portion of our investment 
while we do not anticipate being regulated in the local markets  we are unable to predict future markets  future government impositions or future economic and competitive conditions that could affect the profitability of the communications operations 
results of operations consolidated results overview revenue and income loss from continuing operations provided by each business group as a percentage of our total revenue and net income were as follows revenue integrated energy electric utility communications income loss from continuing operations integrated energy electric utility communications corporate during the second quarter of  we adopted a plan to dispose of our coal marketing subsidiary  black hills coal network due primarily to difficulties in marketing our wyodak coal from the powder river basin of wyoming to midwestern and eastern coal markets 
we sold the non strategic assets effective august  results of operations have been restated to reflect the discontinued operations 
compared to consolidated income from continuing operations for was million  compared to million in  or per share in  compared to per share in income loss from discontinued operations was million or per share in compared to million  or per share  in this equates to an percent and percent return on year end common equity in and  respectively 
the decrease in income from continuing operations was a result of a substantial decrease in prevailing prices for natural gas and wholesale electricity and in gross margins from natural gas marketing activities compared to unusual energy market conditions existed in the first half of stemming primarily from gas and electricity shortages in the west 
approximately per share of the income from continuing operations was attributable to the unusual market conditions that existed at the time 
average wholesale electric average peak prices at mid columbia were approximately per megawatt hour in compared to approximately per megawatt hour in average spot market gas prices in the west coast region were approximately per mmbtu in compared to per mmbtu in while these factors negatively impacted income from continuing operations in  they were offset in part by an increase in the production of coal  oil  gas  power generation capacity  and a decrease in the net loss at our communications business group  primarily attributable to the continued expansion of its customer base 
consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in the decrease in revenues was a result of the high energy commodity prices in  slightly offset by increased revenue in the communications business group and power generation segment  increased production in coal  oil and gas and increased marketing volumes 
consolidated operating expenses decreased from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in fuel costs and a million decrease in administrative expenses offset by a million increase in depreciation expense related to our increased investment in power generation 
administrative and general expenses decreased due to a decrease in commissions and incentive compensation partially offset by increased pension and administrative expenses 
consolidated income taxes decreased million as a result of the decrease in pre tax earnings and a lower effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate decreased from percent in to percent in primarily due to a lower overall effective state income tax rate and the recognition of research and development credits in in addition  earnings were impacted by several non recurring items including a per share charge for a financial exposure to enron corporation  a per share charge for employee stock bonus awards and the funding of the black hills corporation foundation  a per share benefit for the sale of coal mining equipment and a per share benefit for a gain on a coal contract settlement 
compared to consolidated income from continuing operations for was million  compared to million in  or per share in  compared to per share in income from discontinued operations was million or per share in compared to  in this equates to a percent and percent return on year end common equity in and  respectively 
the return on year end common equity in was diluted due to the net proceeds of million from the public stock offering in we reported record earnings in  primarily due to strong natural gas marketing activity  increased fuel production  expanded power generation and increased wholesale off system electric utility sales 
strong results in our integrated energy group and electric utility group were partially offset by losses in our communications group 
unusual energy market conditions related primarily to gas and electricity shortages in the west contributed to our strong financial performance in and there was an approximately and contribution to and earnings per share  respectively  due to high prevailing prices of gas and electricity and unusually wide gas trading margins in the last half of and first half of consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in revenue increased in all segments 
daily volumes of natural gas marketed increased percent from  million british thermal units per day in to  million british thermal units in prices of financial and physical natural gas marketed decreased from an average of per million british thermal units in to per million british thermal units in earnings in included a million after tax charge per share for a financial exposure to enron corporation and certain of its subsidiaries now in bankruptcy 
the exposure is primarily related to the value of long term swaps that hedged the price of natural gas to a power plant 
we have taken action to mitigate this exposure 
we are seeking authority to net  or offset  certain obligations with enron and its subsidiaries  both payable and receivable  among our subsidiaries 
if we are successful in these efforts  substantially all of the financial value of the fuel swap could be recovered  and we would not have any remaining exposure to enron and its bankrupt subsidiaries 
earnings in also reflect a per share charge for employee stock bonus awards and the funding of a non profit foundation to advance our charitable and philanthropic endeavors 
both of these transactions were funded with black hills corporation common stock 
the following business group and segment information does not include discontinued operations and intercompany eliminations 
integrated energy group in thousands revenue power generation    energy marketing    oil and gas    coal mining    total revenue    operating expenses    operating income    change in accounting principle net income    the following is a summary of sales volumes of our coal  oil and natural gas production and our power generation capacity fuel production tons of coal sold    barrels of oil sold    mcf of natural gas sold    mcf equivalent sales    independent power capacity mws of independent power capacity in service a mws of independent power capacity under construction b a includes the mw expansion at the las vegas cogeneration power plant which was placed into service on january  b includes mw plant under lease arrangement in the final stages of construction on december  and completed in the first quarter of the following is a summary of energy marketing average daily volumes energy marketing average daily volumes natural gas mmbtus    crude oil barrels    compared to net income of our integrated energy group decreased percent in compared to earnings decreased primarily due to a substantial decline in energy prices partially offset by growth in the power generation segment 
the power generation segment had a substantial increase in earnings primarily due to results from increased capacity that went into service during and the second half of  additional ownership interest in an energy partnership and a million after tax benefit relating to the collection of receivables reserved for in from california operations 
in addition  was impacted by a million after tax charge for an exposure to enron corporation  a million after tax gain on the sale of coal mining equipment and a million after tax gain on the settlement of a coal contract 
the integrated energy group s revenues declined slightly due to lower commodity prices and margins offset by increased power generation revenues due to an increase in capacity and acquisition of additional power generation partnership interests 
the integrated energy group s total operating expenses increased percent due to expanded power production  and increased costs of sales related to higher volumes of fuel production and tons of coal sold  partially offset by lower incentive compensation in our energy marketing segment 
compared to net income of our integrated energy group nearly doubled in compared to these strong earnings resulted primarily from the unusually high prices of natural gas and high gas trading margins received in western markets during the first half of  an increase in volumes marketed and fuel production  and expanded power generation 
in addition  in  we reached a settlement of ongoing litigation with pacificorp concerning rights and obligations under a coal supply agreement under which pacificorp purchased coal from our coal mine to meet the coal requirements of the wyodak power plant 
as a result of this settlement  we recognized million pre tax non operating income 
in addition  we sold the north conveyor system which resulted in a million pre tax gain 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the integrated energy business group s revenues more than doubled to million in compared to million in the increase was driven by the full year effect of independent power operations revenues related to the july acquisition of indeck capital and an increase in revenue from fuel production and gas marketing 
daily volumes of natural gas marketed increased percent 
the integrated energy business group s total operating expenses increased percent due to expanded power production and increased volumes of fuel production and energy marketed 
operating income increased over percent from levels due to higher production volumes 
power generation our power generation segment produced the following results in thousands revenue    operating income    net income    compared to earnings from the power generation segment increased million primarily due to increased capacity that went into service during and the second half of during we had net megawatts of independent power capacity in service  contributing to operations  compared to net megawatts at december  approximately megawatts of the megawatts of capacity at december  were brought on line during the third quarter of earnings for also reflect a million after tax benefit relating to the collection of receivables reserved for in prior periods and a million benefit  net of taxes from a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of statement of accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles sfas 
in addition  was impacted by a million after tax charge for an exposure to enron corporation 
revenue increased percent with a corresponding percent increase to operating expenses 
approximately percent of the revenue and operating expense increases were attributable to the purchase of an additional percent interest in the harbor cogeneration facility harbor on march  harbor is a megawatt gas fired plant located in wilmington  california 
our investment in harbor prior to this acquisition of an additional percent interest was accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
this acquisition gave us majority ownership and voting control of harbor  therefore we now consolidate harbor into our financial statements 
as a result  this consolidation was partially offset by a million decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
the remaining increase in revenue and operating expenses was due to the additional generating capacity 
interest expense increased million due to a million increase in debt outstanding related to the expansion of our generation portfolio  partially offset by lower interest rates 
compared to reflects the first full year of operations of our power generation segment and our continued expansion of generation facilities 
at december  we owned net megawatts in currently operating plants 
improved financial results due to increased production capacity was offset by a million after tax charge for enron exposure  additional reserves for exposure to western power markets and reduced water flow at hydro power plants in new york 
energy marketing our energy marketing companies produced the following results in thousands revenue    operating income    net income    compared to earnings from the energy marketing segment decreased million due substantially to high gas margins received in the first half of  partially offset by a percent increase in natural gas average daily volumes marketed  a percent increase in average daily volumes of crude oil marketed and lower commissions and incentive compensation 
revenues decreased percent from primarily due to lower gas margins 
unusual energy marketing conditions existed in the first six months of stemming primarily from gas and electricity shortages in the west 
average spot market gas prices in the west coast region were approximately per mmbtu in compared to per mmbtu in the substantial increase in average daily volumes of crude oil marketed was due to oil marketing contracts that we entered into in that do not extend beyond january as a result of changing commodity prices  net income was impacted by unrealized gains recognized through mark to market accounting treatment 
unrealized pre tax mark to market gains losses were million in compared to million in  resulting in a year over year decrease of million pre tax 
operating expenses decreased percent primarily due to a million decrease in commissions and incentive compensation related to the decrease in profitability in this segment partially offset by additional expenses associated with our additional ownership interests in oil pipelines 
compared to earnings from the energy marketing segment increased million primarily due to high gas margins received in the first half of  as well as a percent increase in natural gas average daily volumes marketed in compared to revenues increased percent from primarily due to higher daily volumes and high gas margins 
the unusual energy market conditions related primarily to natural gas and electricity shortages in california and our ability to capture the higher margins contributed significantly to the strong financial performance 
oil and gas oil and gas operating results were as follows in thousands revenue    operating income    net income    the following is a summary of our proved oil and gas reserves at december barrels of oil in thousands    mmcf of natural gas    total in mmcf equivalents    these reserves are based on reports prepared by ralph e 
davis associates  inc  an independent consulting and engineering firm 
reserves were determined using constant product prices at the end of the respective years 
estimates of economically recoverable reserves and future net revenues are based on a number of variables  which may differ from actual results 
as a result of the merger with mallon resources corporation  which was completed in march  we expect to more than double our net proved reserves and increase our production by nearly percent 
mallon s proved reserves  as reported at december   were billion cubic feet of gas equivalent 
compared to net income decreased percent or million  primarily due to a million decrease in revenues 
the decrease in revenues was due to a percent decrease in the average oil and natural gas price received  partially offset by a slight increase in production volumes 
the average gas and oil prices received in were mcf and bbl  respectively compared to mcf and bbl in compared to record net income in was primarily a result of a percent increase in the average price received and a percent increase in production volumes 
the increase in gas reserves at december  was due to strong drilling results and reserve acquisitions 
in  we acquired operating and non operating interests in gas and oil wells located in colorado and wyoming from stewart petroleum corporation of denver  colorado  for approximately million 
the acquired interests in these fuel assets represents approximately billion cubic feet equivalent of natural gas 
the acquisition increased our proved reserves by approximately percent based on year end reserve estimates and our production rates by percent 
coal mining coal mining results were as follows in thousands revenue    operating income    net income    compared to coal mining earnings decreased million as a result of earnings benefits in from a million after tax gain on a coal contract settlement and a million after tax gain on the sale of mining equipment 
coal mining revenue decreased slightly due to a percent decrease in the average price received per ton of coal offset by a percent increase in tons of coal sold 
operating expenses decreased percent or approximately million primarily due to reduced production and severance taxes  reduced royalty expense and capitalization of overburden costs related to developing a new mining area 
compared to coal mining earnings increased million as a result of a coal contract settlement  a gain on the sale of mining equipment and a percent increase in tons sold  partially offset by lower average coal prices due to a coal contract settlement and an increase in mining related expenses 
tons of coal sold increased primarily due to the commencement of sales through our train load out facility 
in  we reached a settlement of ongoing litigation with pacificorp concerning rights and obligations under a coal supply agreement under which pacificorp purchased coal from our coal mine to meet the coal requirements of the wyodak power plant 
as a result of this settlement  we recognized million pre tax non operating income 
in addition  we sold the north conveyor system which resulted in a million pre tax gain

compared to electric revenue decreased percent in compared to the decrease in electric revenue in was due to a million decrease in wholesale off system sales at an average price that was percent lower than the average price in firm kilowatt hour sales decreased percent in residential and commercial sales increases of percent and percent  respectively  in accounted for a million increase in revenue  which was offset by a million decrease in industrial sales  primarily due to discontinued operations at two of our largest and oldest customers  homestake gold mine and federal beef processors 
degree days  a measure of weather trends  were one percent above normal in and four percent above revenue per kilowatt hour sold was cents in compared to cents in the number of customers in the service area at december  increased to  from  in the decrease in the revenue per kilowatt hour sold in is due to a percent decrease in average wholesale off system prices 
electric utility operating expenses decreased million or percent in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in fuel and purchased power costs and a million decrease in operations and maintenance expenses  offset by higher depreciation expense related to the addition of the lange combustion turbine in early the decrease in fuel and purchased power costs was primarily due to the high spot market price for gas and electricity in the first half of the decrease in operations expense was primarily due to a million expense of a temporary generator lease in and a million decrease in incentive compensation in offset by a million increase in pension expense in net interest expense increased million due to the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds in august in addition  earnings included a million after tax charge related to the formation of the black hills corporation foundation 
compared to electric revenue increased percent in compared to the increase in electric revenue in was primarily due to a percent increase in wholesale off system sales at an average price that was percent higher than the average price in the increase in off system sales was driven by high spot market prices for energy in early  which enabled us to generate more energy from our combustion turbine facilities  including the neil simpson combustion turbine  which we placed into commercial operation in june megawatt hours generated from our oil fired diesel and natural gas fired combustion turbines were  in  compared to  in historically  market prices were not sufficient to support the economics of generating from these facilities  except to meet peak demand and as standby use for native load requirements 
firm kilowatt hour sales increased percent in residential and commercial sales increases of percent in were partially offset by a slight decrease in industrial sales  primarily due to load reductions at homestake gold mine 
degree days  a measure of weather trends  were percent below normal in and percent below revenue per kilowatt hour sold was cents in compared to cents in the number of customers in the service area increased to  from  in the increase in the revenue per kilowatt hour sold in is due to a percent increase in wholesale off system sales to  megawatt hours and strong average wholesale power prices 
electric utility operating expenses increased percent in primarily due to a percent increase in purchased power costs and a percent increase in the average cost of generation 
the increase in the average cost of generation was primarily associated with the operation of certain gas fired combustion turbines 
in addition  results include a million after tax non cash charge related to the contribution of black hills corporation common stock to the newly formed black hills corporation foundation 
this foundation was created to enhance our longstanding practice of giving back to our communities 
through the foundation  we may strengthen our service to our valued customers and fellow citizens for generations to come 
communications group in thousands revenue    operating expenses    operating loss    net loss    residential customers    business customers   fiber optic backbone miles hybrid fiber coaxial cable miles in september  we formed our broadband communications business to provide facilities based communications services for rapid city and the northern black hills of south dakota 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in state of the art technology that offers local and long distance telephone service  expanded cable television service  internet access  and high speed data and video services  which completes our initial infrastructure build out 
we began serving communications customers in late and market our services to schools  hospitals  cities  economic development groups  and business and residential customers 
we expect a continuation of better financial performance in as we continue to increase the customer base 
we expect our communications group will sustain approximately million in net losses in  and profitability is expected in the recovery of capital investment and future profitability are dependent on our ability to maintain our customer base and is subject to the risk that technological advances may render our network obsolete 
compared to our customer base increased percent in to  residential customers and  business customers 
a million increase in revenues from a larger customer base in was partially offset by a million increase in cost of sales  a million increase in operations and maintenance expenses and a million increase in depreciation costs 
interest expense decreased million due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher balances 
the million loss in represents a percent improvement over the million loss in compared to our customer base nearly doubled in to  residential customers and  business customers 
the increase in revenues from a larger customer base in was partially offset by increases in reserves for inventory and carrier billings and increased interest expense 
operating expense increased due to the expansion of the business 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying values of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangibles  for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist and at least annually for goodwill as required by sfas for long lived assets with finite lives  this evaluation is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the anticipated future cash flows over a discrete time period is less than the assets carrying value  then a permanent non cash write down equal to the difference between the assets carrying value and the assets fair value  is required to be charged to earnings 
in estimating future cash flows we generally use internal budgets 
although we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
our communications business segment began providing broadband communications services in november and since that time has not achieved profitability 
in each of the last three years  we have evaluated the assets of our communications business segment for impairment  and in each year we determined  based on our assumptions  that the sum of the anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges exceeded the carrying value and  therefore  we did not recognize an impairment 
the carrying value of the assets tested for impairment was million at december  any increases in the anticipated future cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of these assets 
if our current estimates of future cash flows from the operation of these assets had been percent lower  we still would not have been required to record an impairment charge 
during  due to the current depressed market value of merchant generation plants  we evaluated the carrying value of our megawatt gas fired pepperell plant which is part of our non regulated power generation segment 
we determined  based on our assumptions  the sum of the anticipated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges exceeded the carrying value and  therefore  we did not recognize an impairment 
the carrying value of the assets tested for impairment was million at december  any increases in the anticipated future cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of these assets 
if our current estimates of future cash flows from the operation of these assets had been percent lower  we still would not have been required to record an impairment charge 
for long lived assets with indefinite lives  sfas requires an annual impairment test 
upon adopting sfas on january   we completed a transition impairment test in the first quarter of as a result of this impairment test  we recognized a million after tax impairment charge related to the goodwill at our discontinued coal marketing operations 
this impairment charge is reported as part of income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes on the consolidated statements of income 
this impairment charge was offset by income of million  after tax  from the write off of negative goodwill at our non regulated power generation segment  as required by sfas this amount is reported as change in accounting principle  net of taxes on the consolidated statements of income 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter 
this test did not result in an additional impairment 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities we account for our oil and gas activities under the full cost method whereby all productive and nonproductive costs related to acquisition  exploration and development drilling activities are capitalized 
these costs are amortized using a unit of production method based on volumes produced and proved reserves 
any conveyances of properties  including gains or losses on abandonments of properties  are treated as adjustments to the cost of the properties with no gain or loss recognized 
net capitalized costs are subject to a ceilings test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
this method values the reserves based upon actual oil and gas prices at the end of each reporting period adjusted for contracted price changes 
if the net capitalized costs exceed the full cost ceiling  then a permanent non cash write down is required to be charged to earnings in that reporting period 
although our net capitalized costs were less than the full cost ceiling at december   we can make no assurances that a write down in the future will not occur depending on oil and gas prices at that point in time 
in addition  we rely on an independent consulting and engineering firm to determine the amount of our proved reserves based on a number of assumptions about variables 
we can make no assurances that these assumptions will not differ from actual results 
risk management activities we enter into derivative instruments  including options  swaps  futures  forwards and other contractual commitments for both non trading hedging and trading purposes 
in addition to the information provided below  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
non trading hedging our typical non trading hedging transactions relate to contracts we enter into at our oil and gas exploration and production subsidiary to fix the price received for anticipated future production and interest rate swaps we enter into to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
for these and similar transactions  we utilize hedge accounting treatment under sfas accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
as cash flow hedges  these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and the effective portion of the gain or loss is reported in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion in earnings 
energy trading and marketing we have historically accounted for the activities at our natural gas marketing and crude oil marketing subsidiaries as energy trading activities as defined by emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for contracts involving energy trading and risk management activities eitf 
as such  all of the contracts at our energy marketing businesses  whether or not derivatives under sfas  have historically been accounted for under the mark to market method of accounting 
this mark to market process recognizes changes in the value of trading portfolios associated with market price fluctuations 
the current fair values of energy trading contracts are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and any period to period change in the current fair value of such contracts is recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
we have presented the unrealized and realized gains and losses  whether or not settled financially or physically  from the activities of our energy marketing businesses  net in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
valuation fair values of derivative instruments and energy trading contracts originated on or before october   are based on listed market prices  where possible 
if market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors and pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
pricing models and their underlying assumptions impact the amount and timing of unrealized gains and losses recorded  and the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future 
to the extent financial contracts have extended maturity dates  our estimates of fair value may involve greater subjectivity due to the lack of transparent market data available upon which to base modeling assumptions 
new accounting policy during  the eitf discussed issue no 
 issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf and reached a consensus on certain issues 
eitf requires that energy trading contracts be accounted for at fair value 
eitf rescinds eitf and is effective for any new contracts entered into after october  for energy trading contracts entered into through october   such contracts have continued to be accounted for at fair value through december  effective january   contracts that do not meet the accounting definition of derivative  as defined by sfas  are required to be accounted for at historical cost and we will report this as a cumulative effect of an accounting change 
our energy contracts that qualify as derivatives will continue to be accounted for at fair value under sfas eitf requires that energy trading contracts and derivatives  whether settled financially or physically  be reported in the income statement on a net basis effective january  through december   we have presented the unrealized and realized gains and losses  whether or not settled financially or physically  from the activities of our energy marketing businesses  net in operating revenues on the consolidated statements of income 
as discussed below  this current presentation will be effected by the adoption of eitf for our crude oil marketing operations  substantially all crude oil contracts previously met the definition of energy trading activities under eitf accordingly  all contracts at these operations that originated on or before october  have been accounted for at fair value 
with the adoption of eitf  the contracts at our crude oil marketing operations will no longer be recorded at fair value since they do not meet the definition of derivatives  as defined by sfas  and will be accounted for under the accrual method of accounting 
in addition  this will affect the presentation of the related revenues and energy purchase expenses  as under current accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the results of these contracts will need to be presented on a gross basis 
in addition to all of the contracts at our crude oil marketing operations no longer being recorded at fair value  certain contracts and physical positions at our natural gas marketing operations will no longer be recorded at fair value since they do not meet the definition of a derivative under sfas since we use transportation contracts and physical positions to economically hedge our natural gas portfolio  to the extent these items can no longer be accounted for at fair value  it will introduce volatility into future earnings of our natural gas marketing operations 
on january  this adjustment will be recorded as a cumulative effect of an accounting change totaling million  net of tax 
counterparty credit risk we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit and tenor limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current financial information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and established provisions  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
stock based employee compensation plans at december   we had several stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
stock based employee compensation cost is not reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to stock based employee compensation 
year ended december in thousands  except per share amounts net income available for common stock  as reported   deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income    earnings per share as reported basic continuing operations discontinued operations change in accounting principle total diluted continuing operations discontinued operations change in accounting principle total pro forma basic continuing operations discontinued operations change in accounting principle total diluted continuing operations discontinued operations change in accounting principle total pension and other postretirement benefits the determination of our obligation and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the use of assumptions used by actuaries in calculating the amounts 
those assumptions  as further described in note of our notes to the consolidated financial statements  include  among others  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels and healthcare costs 
although we believe our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and our future expense 
defined benefit pension plan we account for our defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for pensions sfas 
in accordance with sfas  changes in pension obligations associated with fluctuations in long term actuarial assumptions may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded non cash expense income related to our pension plans of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our pension plan assets are held in trust and primarily consist of equity securities and cash equivalents 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension costs 
in selecting an assumed rate of return on plan assets  we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
the market value of the plan s assets has been affected by sharp declines in equity markets since the end of plan assets lost earned million  million and million during  and  respectively 
in the recently completed actuarial valuation  we decreased the assumed rate of return on plan assets from percent to percent 
this change is expected to increase pension costs in and beyond by approximately million per year 
the percent assumed rate of return was determined based on the following estimated long term investment allocations and asset class returns asset class estimated allocation estimated return weighted average return equity fixed income cash the long term estimated return on the equity component was derived from long term historical equity returns 
we reviewed annual   and year returns on the s p index source bloomberg  which were  at december   percent  percent  percent and percent respectively 
estimated expense ratios were based on current expense ratios of 
percent for us index equity and 
percent for international equity 
the long term estimated fixed income return was estimated based on the historical annual returns on intermediate term treasury bonds returns of percent from to cash returns are estimated to be basis points below intermediate term treasury bonds 
as a result of the decline in the value of our plan assets and due to a reduction in the discount rate used to determine the year end liability  during the fiscal year ended at december   we were required to recognize an additional minimum liability as prescribed by sfas the liability was recorded as a reduction to common equity through a million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets  but the adjustment did not affect net income for the charge to accumulated other comprehensive income will be restored through common equity in future periods to the extent fair value of the plan assets exceed the accumulated benefit obligation 
based on our recently completed plan forecasts  we estimate that we will be required to make cash contributions to the pension plan beginning in in the amount of approximately million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and approximately million per year thereafter 
non qualified pension plans we have various supplemental retirement plans for our outside directors and key executives 
the plans are nonqualified defined benefit plans accounted for in accordance with sfas expenses recognized under the plans were million in and million in and the plans are unfunded 
the provisions of sfas required us to record an additional minimum liability of million at december  the liability was recorded as a reduction to common equity through a million after tax charge to accumulated other comprehensive income on the consolidated balance sheets 
other postretirement benefits we account for our other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
we do not pre fund our other postretirement benefit plan 
our reported costs of providing other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  including health care cost trends  and result from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
as a result of these factors  significant portions of other postretirement benefit costs recorded in any period do not reflect the actual benefits provided to plan participants 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million each year in accordance with sfas actual payments of benefits to retirees during these periods were approximately million per year 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate 
change in assumption impact on december  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation impact on service and interest cost in thousands increase  decrease  in selecting an assumed discount rate  we considered comparable high grade bond rates at which the retirement rates could be effectively settled 
based on these considerations  we have changed the discount rate used by the plan actuary to determine our other postretirement benefit expense  for years and beyond to percent from percent in in selecting assumed health care cost trend rates  we consider recent plan experience and various short and long term cost forecasts for the healthcare industry 
based on these considerations we have changed the health care cost trend rate used by the actuaries to determine our other postretirement benefit expense  for and beyond  from percent decreasing gradually to percent  to percent in decreasing gradually to percent in these changes will increase the future other postretirement benefit expense included on our income statement by approximately liquidity and capital resources cash flow activities in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to pay a portion of our long term debt maturities and to fund a portion of our property additions 
we continue to fund property and investment additions primarily related to construction and acquisition of additional electric generation facilities for our integrated energy group through a combination of operating cash flow  increased short term debt  long term debt and long term non recourse project financing 
cash flows from operations increased million  due to a million increase in deferred income taxes and a million increase in depreciation expense  offset primarily by the decrease in net income and the provision for valuation allowances 
during  we recognized a substantial increase in our deferred income tax liability due to timing differences associated with accelerated depreciation and expenses related to our large capital investment in power generation assets in and in  our provision for valuation allowances was larger than normal due to a million pre tax reserve recognized for exposure to enron  a million reserve recognized in for exposure to california markets which was recovered in and provisions recognized for inventory valuations in our communications group 
during  we had cash outflows for investing activities of million  which includes million for property  plant and equipment additions and million related to acquisitions 
net cash inflows from financing activities totaled million 
a detailed description of the significant investing and financing activities follows 
on march   we acquired an additional percent interest in millennium pipeline company  lp  which owns and operates a mile pipeline  and an additional ownership interest in millennium terminal company  lp  which has million barrels of crude oil storage connected to the millennium pipeline at the oil tanking terminal in beaumont  texas 
total cost of the acquisition was million and was funded through borrowings under short term revolving credit facilities 
on march   we closed on million five year senior secured project level financing for the arapahoe and valmont facilities 
these projects have a total of megawatts in service and are located in the denver  colorado area 
proceeds from this financing were used to replace an existing million seven year  secured term project level facility  pay down approximately million of short term credit facility borrowings  and the remainder was used for project construction 
on march   we acquired an additional percent interest in the harbor cogeneration facility  a megawatt gas fired plant located in wilmington  california for million 
this acquisition was also funded through borrowings under short term revolving credit facilities 
during the first quarter of  we completed a million bridge credit agreement 
the credit agreement supplemented our revolving credit facilities and had the same terms as those facilities with an original expiration date of june   which subsequently was extended to september  on september  this million facility was replaced by a million secured financing for the expansion at our las vegas ii project which expires on may  this financing is guaranteed by black hills corporation 
on june   we closed on a million bridge credit agreement 
this credit agreement bridged the issuance of million of black hills power first mortgage bonds  which we issued on august  the termination date of the bridge credit agreement was august   the date on which the first mortgage bonds were issued 
during july  we purchased the assets of the kilgore to houston pipeline system from equilon pipeline company  llc 
the kilgore pipeline transports crude oil from the kilgore  texas region south to houston  texas  which is the transfer point to connecting carriers via the oil tanking houston terminal facilities 
this pipeline is approximately miles long and has a capacity up to approximately  barrels per day 
in addition  the kilgore system has approximately  barrels of crude oil storage at kilgore and  barrels of storage at the texoma tank farm located in longview  texas 
total cost of the acquisition was million and was funded through borrowings under short term credit facilities 
on august   our electric utility subsidiary  black hills power  inc  issued million of first mortgage bonds  series ae  due the mortgage bonds have a percent coupon with interest payable semiannually 
net proceeds from the offering were and will be used to fund our utility s portion of the construction and installation costs for an ac dc ac converter station  for general capital expenditures for the remainder of and  to repay a portion of short term bank indebtedness  to satisfy bond maturities for certain outstanding first mortgage bonds due in  and for general corporate purposes 
in august  we closed on a million revolving unsecured credit facility that expires august  the credit facility extended our previous million day credit facility that expired on august  on september   we closed on a million unsecured two year credit agreement 
proceeds were used to fund our working capital needs and for general corporate purposes 
on october   we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire denver based mallon resources corporation  an oil and gas exploration and production company 
the acquisition was completed on march   whereby each shareholder of mallon received of a share of black hills corporation common stock for each share of mallon common stock 
total cost of the acquisition was approximately million  which includes our acquisition on october  of mallon s debt to aquila energy capital corporation and the settlement of outstanding hedges  totaling million 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased the remaining ownership interests in the harbor cogeneration facility and the pepperell facility  a megawatt gas fired plant located in pepperell  massachusetts for million  giving us percent ownership interests in the facilities 
these acquisitions were funded through borrowings under short term revolving credit facilities 
on december   we closed on a million eight year financing secured by our megawatt gillette combustion turbine 
on the same date  we also closed on a million eight year financing secured by a lm spare turbine 
proceeds were used to pay down short term credit facility borrowings 
in  we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our operating needs  to pay dividends on common and preferred stock  to pay long term debt maturities and to fund a material amount of our property additions 
we funded property and investment additions primarily related to construction of additional electric generation facilities for our integrated energy business group through a combination of operating cash flow  increased short term debt and long term non recourse project financing 
cash flows from operations increased million  primarily due to increased net income  depreciation  deferred taxes and decreased working capital 
in the second quarter of  we issued million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering at per share 
total net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay a portion of current indebtedness under revolving credit facilities  to fund various power plant construction projects and for general corporate purposes 
also  in the second quarter of we acquired the fountain valley facility  a megawatt generation facility located near colorado springs  colorado  featuring six lm simple cycle  gas fired turbines from enron corporation 
the facility became operational in the third quarter of total project cost was approximately million that we financed primarily with non recourse debt 
we have an year contract with public service company of colorado to utilize the facility for peaking purposes under a tolling arrangement in which we assume no fuel risk 
in the third quarter of  we purchased a megawatt gas fired co generation power plant project located in north las vegas  nevada from enron north america  a wholly owned subsidiary of enron corporation 
at acquisition  the facility had a megawatt co generation power plant in operation of which we own percent 
although we only own percent of this power plant  under generally accepted accounting principles we are required to consolidate percent of this plant 
most of the power from the megawatt facility is sold under a long term contract expiring in in addition  the project also had a megawatt combined cycle expansion under construction  of which we own percent 
the facility became fully operational in january and utilizes lm technology 
the power to be generated by the expansion project is also under a long term sales contract that expires in total cost of the project is estimated to be approximately million of which million was expended and financed with short term borrowings at december  in addition  during the third quarter of  we completed a million revolving credit facility  which replaced our previous short term credit lines  which totaled million 
dividends dividends paid on our common stock totaled per share in this reflected increases approved by our board of directors from per share in and per share in all dividends were paid out of current earnings 
our three year annual dividend growth was percent 
in january  our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend percent to cents per share 
if this dividend is maintained during  it will be equivalent to per share  an annual increase of cents per share 
the determination of the amount of future cash dividends  if any  to be declared and paid will depend upon  among other things  our financial condition  funds from operations  the level of our capital expenditures  restrictions under our credit facilities and our future business prospects 
short term liquidity our principal sources of short term liquidity are our revolving bank facilities and cash provided by operations 
as of december  we had approximately million of cash unrestricted for operations and million of credit through revolving bank facilities 
approximately million of the cash balance at december  was restricted by subsidiary debt agreements that limit our subsidiaries ability to dividend cash to the parent company 
the bank facilities consisted of a million facility due august  and a million facility due august  these bank facilities can be used to fund our working capital needs  for general corporate purposes and to provide liquidity for a commercial paper program if implemented 
at december   we had million of bank borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
after inclusion of applicable letters of credit  the remaining borrowing capacity under the bank facilities was million at december  the above bank facilities include covenants that are common in such arrangements 
several of the facilities require that we maintain a consolidated net worth in an amount of not less than the sum of million and percent of our aggregate consolidated net income beginning april   a recourse leverage ratio not to exceed to  and a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to in addition  the million day credit facility and the million three year credit facility contain a liquidity covenant that requires us to have million of liquid assets as of the last day of each fiscal quarter beginning with december  liquid assets are defined as unrestricted cash and available unused capacity under our credit facilities 
if these covenants are violated  it would be considered an event of default entitling the lender to terminate the remaining commitment and accelerate all principal and interest outstanding 
in addition  certain of our interest rate swap agreements with a million notional amount at december  include cross default provisions 
these provisions would allow the counterparty the right to terminate the swap agreement and liquidate at a prevailing market rate in the event of default 
as of december   we were in compliance with the above covenants 
some of our facilities previously had a covenant whereby we were required to maintain a credit rating of at least bbb from standard poor s or baa from moody s investor service 
the facilities that contained the rating triggers were amended during the second quarter of to remove default provisions pertaining to our credit rating status 
our consolidated net worth was million at december   which was approximately million in excess of the net worth we are required to maintain under the debt covenant described above 
the long term debt component of our capital structure at december  was percent  our total debt recourse leverage ratio was percent and our total debt recourse and non recourse leverage ratio was percent 
at december   we also had a million short term secured financing in place that matures on may  in addition  enserco energy  inc  our natural gas marketing unit  has a million uncommitted  discretionary line of credit to provide support for the purchase of natural gas 
we provided no guarantee to the lender under this facility 
at december   there were outstanding letters of credit issued under the facility of million with no borrowing balances on the facility 
similarly  black hills energy resources  inc  our crude oil marketing unit  had a million uncommitted  discretionary credit facility 
this line of credit provided credit support for the purchases of crude oil by black hills energy resources 
we provided no guarantee to the lender under this facility 
at december   black hills energy resources had letters of credit outstanding of million and no borrowing balance outstanding on its overdraft line 
we continue to seek non recourse project level financing for our independent power projects 
due to creditworthiness concerns with counterparties  financing arrangements for the las vegas ii power plant have been delayed 
allegheny energy supply company aesc  a subsidiary of allegheny energy inc  has a contract to purchase all of the capacity and all associated energy and ancillary services from our megawatt las vegas ii plant 
both aesc and its parent  allegheny energy inc have recently had their credit ratings downgraded below investment grade status and have technically defaulted on some of their credit agreements with other counterparties 
las vegas ii became operational in january and has been funded with the corporate credit facilities 
total construction and acquisition costs  including las vegas i  are expected to be million of which million was expended as of december  in march we received a million bank letter of credit from aesc which expires in december in the event the bank letter of credit is not renewed at that time  the full amount of the letter of credit can be drawn 
the bank letter of credit was provided in conjunction with a tolling contract for capacity and energy from the power plant expansion 
on november  we filed a form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
this shelf registration became effective on february  and will enable us to proceed with equity or debt offerings in a total amount of up to million in capital as opportunities and capital market conditions warrant 
if we are not successful in extending or replacing the million of facilities that expire in or in obtaining other financing  a deficiency in our liquidity could occur 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and capital market conditions 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all 
the following information is provided to summarize cash obligations and commercial commitments 
as shown in the table  we have million of long term debt maturing in payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years notes payable   long term debt      operating lease obligations a     unconditional purchase obligations b     other long term obligations c    total contractual cash obligations a represents the off balance sheet arrangement described below 
b unconditional purchase obligations include the capacity costs associated with a purchase power agreement with pacificorp and certain gas purchase and gas transportation agreements 
the energy charge under the purchase power agreement and the commodity price under the gas purchase contract are variable costs  which for purposes of estimating our future obligations  were calculated using existing prices at december  c includes the forecasted minimum contributions for our pension plan for the next ten years based upon an actuary study using a percent asset return assumption and a percent discount rate and our reclamation liability for our coal mine 
under our coal mining permit  we are required to reclaim all land where we have mined coal reserves 
the cost of reclaiming the land is accrued as the coal is mined 
while the reclamation process takes place on a continual basis  much of the reclamation occurs over an extended period after we mine the area 
as of december   accrued reclamation costs were approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements black hills generation  a subsidiary in our power generation segment  has entered into agreements with wygen funding  limited partnership  an unrelated  unconsolidated special purpose entity spe  to lease the wygen plant  a megawatt coal fired power plant under construction in campbell county  wyoming 
wygen funding owns the wygen plant  has financed the project and will lease it to our subsidiary upon completion of construction 
lease payments are expected to commence in the second quarter of we entered into this financing arrangement due to its low cost of financing 
the spe has an aggregate financing commitment from equity and debt participants of million 
the wygen plant is the only asset that the spe owns 
the initial lease term is five years with two five year renewal options and includes a purchase option equal to the adjusted acquisition cost 
the adjusted acquisition cost is essentially equal to the cost of the project 
at the end of each lease term  we may renew the lease  purchase the facility  or sell the facility on behalf of the spe  to an independent third party 
if the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are insufficient to repay the investors  we will be required to make a payment to the spe of the shortfall up to percent of the adjusted acquisition cost 
we have guaranteed the obligations of black hills generation to the spe 
as of december   costs incurred totaled million  and the total costs for the completed facility are expected to be million 
the lease is currently considered an operating lease for financial accounting purposes 
therefore  neither the facility nor the related obligations are reported on our balance sheet 
the lease is a london interbank offered rate libor based variable rate obligation 
consequently  as market rates increase  the payments under this lease will also increase 
annual payments of approximately million represent future minimum payments under the first five year lease term calculated using an effective borrowing rate of percent the rate in effect at december  
a one percent increase in the borrowing rate will increase the annual lease payment by approximately million 
in january the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
under the new accounting interpretation  we will be required to consolidate the spe by july   unless the transaction is restructured 
we currently do not plan on restructuring the lease 
the effect of consolidating the spe into our financials would be to record both the wygen asset and its related debt on our balance sheet which will be in the range of million 
in addition  the net effect of consolidating the income statement of the spe would be to recognize the depreciation and interest expense of the spe in place of recognizing lease expense 
this charge is estimated to have approximately a million per year negative effect on pre tax income using a year depreciable life 
guarantees we provide various guarantees supporting certain of our subsidiaries under specified agreements or transactions 
at december   we had guarantees totaling million in place of which million expired in january of the million  million was related to guarantees associated with subsidiaries debt to third parties  which is recorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets  million was to guarantee a subsidiary s obligation on an off balance sheet transaction  million was related to performance obligations under subsidiary contracts and million was related to indemnification for reclamation and surety bonds of subsidiaries 
for more information on these guarantees  see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes our guarantees outstanding at december  nature of guarantee outstanding at december  year expiring in thousands completion guarantee for the expanded facilities under a construction loan for black hills colorado  guarantee of secured financing for the las vegas ii project  guarantee payments under certain energy marketing derivative  power and gas agreements  guarantee of obligation of las vegas cogen ii under an interconnection and operation agreement guarantee performance of black hills generation under a power sales agreement  guarantee obligations under the wygen plant lease  guarantee payment and performance under credit agreements for two combustion turbines  indemnification for subsidiary reclamation surety bonds  credit ratings as of february   our issuer credit rating is baa by moody s investors service and our corporate credit rating is bbb by standard poor s 
in addition  our utility s first mortgage bonds are rated baa and bbb by moody s and standard poor s  respectively 
moody s downgraded our issuer credit rating to baa in december these security ratings are subject to revision and or withdrawal at any time by the respective rating organizations 
any further reduction in our ratings by moody s and standard poor s  particularly a reduction to a level below investment grade  could adversely affect our ability to refinance our existing debt and to complete new financings 
capital requirements our primary capital requirements for the three years ended december  were as follows in thousands property additions and acquisition costs integrated energy    electric utility    communications and other    common stock dividends    maturities redemptions of long term debt    our capital additions for were million 
the major capital items for the year included the following acquisition of additional assets and interests in crude oil pipelines and storage facilities 
continuation of the construction of our megawatt gas fired las vegas ii power plant located near las vegas  nevada  which was placed into service in january completion of construction of the megawatt combined cycle expansion at our arapahoe site in denver  colorado  which was placed into service in october acquisition of an additional percent interest in the harbor cogeneration facility 
acquisitions of various interests in partnerships in which we previously held a majority interest 
completion of construction of the lange combustion turbine for our electric utility  which was placed into service in march construction of an ac dc ac converter station for our electric utility 
continuation of the construction of our communications fiber optic network 
our capital additions for were million 
the major capital items for the year included the following acquisition of the megawatt fountain valley gas fired turbine generation facility located near colorado springs  colorado which was placed in service in third quarter acquisition of the megawatt gas fired co generation power plant project located near las vegas  nevada of which megawatts were operational and megawatts  which were placed in service in january construction of the megawatt combined cycle expansion at our arapahoe site in denver  colorado  which was placed in service in october completion of construction of the megawatt gas turbine expansion at our valmont  colorado site  which we placed in service in july completion of construction of the megawatt gas fired combustion turbine unit at our wyodak site  which we placed in service in may completion of the megawatt combined cycle upgrade of the harbor facility near long beach  california 
acquisitions of various interests in partnerships in which we previously held a minority interest 
acquisition of operating and non operating interests in gas and oil wells from stewart petroleum corporation 
construction of a megawatt gas fired turbine known as the lange project  which was placed in service in early construction of our communications fiber optic network 
forecasted capital requirements for projected plant construction  other integrated energy investments  regulated utility capital improvements and completion of the communications network are as follows in thousands integrated energy    electric utility    communications    our integrated energy business group s forecasted capital requirements include deployment of million for generating projects and acquisitions of proven producing natural gas properties and low risk exploration and development drilling in years we expect to finance our integrated energy business group s purchase and construction of power generating facilities  primarily with long term  non recourse project level debt 
we expect that any project level debt will contain significant restrictions on distributions of cash from the project to us 
in addition to the above forecasted capital items  we will lease the wygen plant  a megawatt coal fired plant under construction at our wyodak  wyoming site through a synthetic lease financing arrangement discussed above under short term liquidity 
because of the leasing arrangement  the million total construction cost of the plant is not included in the above three year capital expenditure forecast 
wygen is similar in design to our neil simpson ii facility  which was completed in at the same site 
the plant will run on low sulfur coal fed by conveyor from our adjacent wyodak coal mine and will use the latest available environmental control technology 
the wygen plant became operational in february forecasted capital expenditures for our electric utility operations include completion of construction of an ac dc ac tie which is expected to be placed in service in  transmission and substation projects  re build projects on existing transmission lines  distribution projects in response to customer requests for electric service  capital projects associated with our utility s existing generation plants  and other miscellaneous items 
our communications group s capital requirements forecast consists of nominal extensions of the base network to reach additional customers and capital improvements to the existing network infrastructure 
market risk disclosures our activities in the regulated and unregulated energy sector expose us to a number of risks in the normal operations of our businesses 
depending on the activity  we are exposed to varying degrees of market risk and counterparty risk 
we have developed policies  processes  systems  and controls to manage and mitigate these risks 
market risk is the potential loss that might occur as a result of an adverse change in market price or rate 
we are exposed to the following market risks commodity price risk associated with our marketing businesses  our natural length in crude oil and natural gas production  and fuel procurement for our gas fired generation assets  and interest rate risk associated with our variable rate credit facilities and our project financing floating rate debt as described in notes and of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to these market risks is affected by a number of factors including the size  duration  and composition of our energy portfolio  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates and commodity prices  the volatility of these prices and rates  and the liquidity of the related interest rate and commodity markets 
to manage and mitigate these identified risks  we have adopted the black hills corporation risk policies and procedures bhcrpp 
these policies have been approved by our board of directors and are routinely reviewed by its audit committee 
these policies include governance  control infrastructure  authorized commodities and trading instruments  prohibited activities  employee conduct  etc 
we have a formalized executive risk committee composed of senior level executives that meets on a regular basis to review our business and credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the authorized policies 
trading activities natural gas marketing we have a natural gas marketing business specializing in producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing that conducts business in western and mid continent regions of the united states and canada 
for producer services our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchases  scheduling services  imbalance management  risk management services and transportation management 
we accomplish this goal through industry experience  extensive contacts  transportation and risk management expertise  trading skills and personal attention 
our origination efforts focus on supplying and providing asset optimization services to large end use consumers of natural gas 
our wholesale marketing activity has two functions support the efforts of producer services and end use origination groups  and market third party natural gas 
these functions are predominately value added services and or storage and transportation arbitrage opportunities 
to effectively manage our producer services  end use origination and wholesale marketing portfolios  we enter into forward physical commodity contracts  financial instruments including over the counter swaps and options and transportation agreements 
we conduct our gas marketing business activities within the parameters as defined and allowed in the bhcrpp and further delineated in the gas marketing commodity risk policies and procedures crpp as approved by the executive risk committee 
as a general policy  we permit only limited market risk positions as clearly defined in these policies and procedures 
therefore  substantially all of our marketing positions are fully hedged 
we attempt to balance our portfolio in terms of volume and timing of performance and delivery obligations 
monitoring and reporting market risk exposures senior management uses a number of quantitative tools to measure  monitor  and limit our exposure to market risk in our natural gas portfolio 
we measure and monitor the market risk inherent in the natural gas trading portfolio employing value at risk var analysis and scenario analysis 
var is a statistical measure that quantifies the probability and magnitude of potential future losses related to open contract positions 
we use scenario analysis to test the impact of extreme moves in overall commodity prices on our portfolio value 
we also monitor and limit our market risk by establishing limits on the nominal size of positions based on trader  location  and market 
var is a statistical measure used to quantify the potential loss in fair value of the trading portfolio over a particular time  with a specified likelihood of occurrence  due to adverse market price changes 
we use an external var model from a third party vendor using independent commodity pricing data 
the modeling of var involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
inputs for the var calculation include commodity prices  positions  instrument valuations  and variance covariance matrices 
while we believe that our assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is currently no uniform methodology or best practice for calculating var in the energy sector 
we calculate var on a daily basis to determine the potential three day favorable and unfavorable changes to the market value of our portfolio 
the var is computed utilizing monte carlo simulation based on correlation matrices for price movements over a specified period generally ranging from one to three months to simulate forward price curves in the natural gas markets to estimate the worst case outcomes on the existing portfolio value 
the var computations utilize a percent confidence level for the resultant price movement and the holding period specified for the calculation 
this calculation means that there is a one in one hundred in statistical chance that the portfolio value will fall below the expected maximum potential reduction in portfolio value at least as large as the reported var over a three day period 
at year end  the three day natural gas trading portfolio var calculation was million using a percent confidence level 
actual commodity price volatility can result in portfolio values worse than predicted using the var model 
the var methodology assumes a normal distribution of price changes  thus  if the actual distribution is not normal  the var may understate actual results 
var is used to estimate the risk of the entire gas marketing portfolio 
for locations that have insufficient daily trading activity  var may not accurately estimate risk due to limited price information 
therefore  stress tests are employed  in addition to var  to further measure risk when market price information may prove insufficient 
var is effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are not sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that past changes in assumed market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
var should be evaluated in light of this and the methodology s other limitations 
our natural gas marketing operations fall under the purview of eitf  sfas  and for contracts entered into after october   in accordance with eitf as such  all natural gas contracts entered into on or before october  and contracts entered after that date that meet the definition of a derivative as defined by sfas  are accounted for under mark to market accounting 
the fair values are recorded as either derivative assets and or derivative liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the net gains or losses are recorded as operating revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

of this amount  million was current and million was non current 
the source of fair value measurements were as follows in thousands maturities source of fair value total fair value actively quoted ie  exchange traded prices  prices provided by other external sources    modeled total    activities other than trading crude oil marketing we have a crude oil marketing and transportation services company operating predominately in texas  oklahoma  and louisiana 
we specialize in providing independent producers with marketing and transportation services necessary to market their crude oil production to end use markets 
our main objective is to provide value in the supply chain by acting as the producer s marketing arm for wellhead purchasing  scheduling services  imbalance management and transportation management 
to provide these services  we execute forward physical crude oil purchase contracts with producers and resell into various crude oil markets 
through these transactions  we effectively lock in a marketing fee equal to the difference between the sales price and the purchase price  less transportation costs 
the crude oil marketing portfolio is essentially hedged whereby market risk  basis risk and quality differentials are mitigated or eliminated 
we do not speculate with the crude oil marketing portfolio with the intent to generate profits from short term market differences 
any accepted risk will be from small differences in contract terms  index risk  or credit risk 
any risk that we identify will be managed and mitigated within the guidelines stipulated in the bhcrpp 
our crude oil marketing operations have historically fallen under the purview of eitf and as such  all crude oil contracts entered into on or before october   have been accounted for under mark to market accounting 
the fair values are recorded as either derivative assets and or derivative liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the net gains or losses have been recorded as operating revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
with the adoption of eitf  the contracts entered into at our crude oil marketing operations do not meet the definition of derivatives under sfas and hence none of these contracts entered into after october  will be marked to market in future financial statements 
the contract or notional amounts and terms of our crude oil contracts at december  are set forth below notional amounts maximum term in years notional amounts maximum term in years thousands of barrels crude oil purchased  
 crude oil sold  
 on december  and  our crude oil contracts entered into on or before october  were marked to fair value and the gains and or losses recognized in earnings 
the amounts related to the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income as of december  and are as follows in thousands current assets non current assets current liabilities non current liabilities unrealized gain december    december    oil and gas exploration and production we produce natural gas and crude oil through our exploration and production activities 
these natural long positions  or unhedged open positions  introduce commodity price risk and variability in our cash flows 
we employ risk management methods to mitigate this commodity price risk and preserve our cash flows 
we have adopted guidelines covering hedging for our natural gas and crude oil production 
these guidelines have been approved by our board of directors and are routinely reviewed by our audit committee 
any hedging strategies are conducted within an enterprise wide perspective 
as more fully defined in the next section  we have some fuel procurement risk within our gas fired generation asset business 
therefore  hedging in the oil and gas segment considers any natural hedge offsets in the power generation segment 
in certain cases  we do not hedge forecasted natural gas production when we have offsetting market risk in our fuel requirements in the power generation segment 
in other words  exploration and production s natural length is used to offset generation s short position 
to mitigate commodity price risk and preserve cash flows  we use over the counter swaps and options 
these derivative instruments fall under the purview of sfas and we elect to utilize hedge accounting as allowed under this statement 
at december   we had a portfolio of swaps to hedge portions of our crude oil and natural gas production 
these transactions were previously identified as cash flow hedges  properly documented and initially met prospective effectiveness testing 
at year end  these transactions met retrospective effectiveness testing criteria and retained their cash flow hedge status 
at december   the derivatives were marked to fair value and were recorded as derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of the gain or loss on these derivatives was reported in accumulated other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion was reported in earnings 
on december  and  we had the following swaps and related balances in thousands december  notional maximum terms in years current assets non current assets current liabilities non current liabilities pre tax accumulated other comprehensive income loss earnings loss crude oil swap  natural gas swaps  december  crude oil swaps  natural gas swaps   crude in bbls  gas in mmbtu s most of our crude oil and natural gas hedges are highly effective  resulting in very little earnings impact prior to realization 
during  we recorded a million loss due to ineffectiveness for certain crude oil swaps due to basis risk 
all existing hedges at december  expire during the year ended december  the unrealized earnings gains or losses currently recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are expected to be realized in earnings during based on december  market prices  million loss will be realized and reported in earnings during these estimated realized losses for were calculated using december  market prices 
estimated and actual realized losses will likely change during as market prices change 
power generation we have a portfolio of gas fired fueled generation assets located throughout several western states 
most of these generation assets are sold under long term tolling contracts with third parties whereby any commodity price risk is transferred to the third party 
however  we do have some gas fired generation assets under long term contracts and a few merchant plants that do possess market risk for fuel purchases 
it is our policy that fuel risk  to the extent possible  will be hedged 
since we are long natural gas in our exploration and production segment  we look at our enterprise wide natural gas market risk when hedging at the subsidiary level 
therefore  we may attempt to hedge only enterprise wide long or short positions 
a potential risk related to power sales is the price risk arising from the sale of wholesale power that exceeds our generating capacity 
these short positions can arise from unplanned plant outages or from unanticipated load demands 
to control such risk  we restrict wholesale off system sales to amounts by which our anticipated generating capabilities exceed our anticipated load requirements plus a required reserve margin 
financing activities we engage in activities to manage risks associated with changes in interest rates 
we have entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with our floating rate debt obligations 
at december   these hedges met effectiveness testing criteria and retained their cash flow hedge status 
at december   we had million of notional amount floating to fixed interest rate swaps  having a maximum term of four years and a fair value of million 
these hedges are substantially effective and any ineffectiveness was immaterial 
on december  and  our interest rate swaps and related balances were as follows in thousands december  notional weighted average fixed interest rate maximum terms in years current assets non current assets current liabilities non current liabilities pre tax accumulated other comprehensive income loss swaps on project financing    swaps on corporate debt   december  swaps on project financing    swaps on corporate debt   we anticipate a portion of unrealized losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income will be realized as increased interest expense in based on december  market interest rates  million will be realized as additional interest expense during estimated and realized amounts will likely change during as market interest rates change 
at december   we had million of outstanding  variable rate debt of which million was not offset with interest rate swap transactions that effectively convert the debt to a fixed rate 
a basis point increase in interest rates would cause interest expense to increase million 
the table below presents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our short term investments and long term debt obligations  including current maturities in thousands 
thereafter total cash equivalents fixed rate   long term debt fixed rate      average interest rate variable rate a     average interest rate total long term debt     average interest rate a approximately percent of the variable rate long term debt has been hedged with interest rate swaps moving the floating rates to fixed rates with an average interest rate of percent 
credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss resulting from non performance of contractual obligations by a counterparty 
we have adopted the black hills corporation credit policy bhccp that establishes guidelines  controls  and limits to manage and mitigate credit risk within risk tolerances established by the board of directors 
in addition  we have a formalized executive credit committee composed of senior executives that meets on a regular basis to review the company s credit activities and to ensure that these activities are conducted within the policies adopted by the company 
for our energy marketing  production  and generation activities  we attempt to mitigate our credit risk by conducting a majority of our business with investment grade companies  setting tenor and credit limits commensurate with counterparty financial strength  obtaining netting agreements  and securing our credit exposure with less creditworthy counterparties through parental guaranties  prepayments  letters of credit  and asset security agreements 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issue that we have identified 
while most credit losses have historically been within our expectations and provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past or that an investment grade counterparty will not default sometime in the future 
at the end of the year  our credit exposure exclusive of regulated utility retail customers and communications was concentrated with investment grade companies 
approximately percent of our credit exposure was with investment grade companies 
for the percent credit exposure with non investment grade rated counterparties  approximately percent of this exposure was supported through letters of credit  prepayments  parental guarantees and asset liens 
rate regulation existing rate regulation in june  the south dakota public utilities commission approved a settlement  which extended a rate freeze in effect since until january the south dakota settlement provides that  absent an extraordinary event  we may not file for any increase in our rates or invoke any fuel and purchased power adjustment tariff which would take effect during the freeze period 
the specified extraordinary events are new governmental impositions increasing annual costs for south dakota customers by more than million  simultaneous forced outages of both our wyodak plant and neil simpson ii plant projected to continue at least days  forced outages occurring to either plant which continue for a period of three months and are projected to last at least nine months  an increase in the consumer price index at a monthly rate for six months which would result in a percent or higher annual inflation rate  the loss of a south dakota customer or revenue from an existing south dakota customer that would result in a loss of revenue of million or more during any month period  the cost of coal to our south dakota customers increases and is projected to increase by more than million over the cost for the most recent calendar year  and electric deregulation occurs as a result of either federal or state mandate  which allows any of our customers to choose its provider of electricity at any time during the freeze period 
during the freeze period  except as identified above  we are undertaking the risks of machinery failure  load loss caused by either an economic downturn or changes in regulation  increased costs under power purchase contracts over which we have no control  government interferences  and acts of nature and other unexpected events that could cause material losses of income or increases in costs of doing business 
however  the settlement anticipates that we will retain  during that period of time  earnings realized from more efficient operations  sales from load growth  and off system sales of power and energy 
over the last five years we have initiated an effort to enter into new contracts with our largest industrial customers 
the new contracts contain meet or release provisions that grant us a five year right to continue to serve a customer at market rates in the event of deregulation 
additionally  through our general service large optional combined account billing tariff  we have allowed general service customers to aggregate their loads 
this tariff also provides us with a five year right to continue to serve those customers in the event of deregulation 
our meet or release contracts currently total more than megawatts of large commercial and industrial load 
these contracts provide us the assurance of a firm local market for our power resources  in the event deregulation occurs 
these industrial and large commercial customers  together with our wholesale power sale agreements with the city of gillette  wyoming and montana dakota utilities company  equal approximately percent of our utility s firm load 
regulatory accounting as it pertains to the accounting for our utility operations  we follow sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  and our financial statements reflect the effects of the different ratemaking principles followed by the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
as a result of our regulatory activity  a year depreciable life for the neil simpson ii plant is used for financial reporting purposes 
if we were not following sfas  a to year life would probably be more appropriate  which would increase depreciation expense by approximately million per year 
if rate recovery of generation related costs becomes unlikely or uncertain  due to competition or regulatory action  these accounting standards may no longer apply to our generation operations 
in the event we determine that we no longer meet the criteria for following sfas  the accounting impact to us could be an extraordinary non cash charge to operations of an amount that could be material 
criteria that may give rise to the discontinuance of sfas include increasing competition that could restrict our ability to establish prices to recover specific costs and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
we periodically review these criteria to ensure that the continuing application of sfas is appropriate
