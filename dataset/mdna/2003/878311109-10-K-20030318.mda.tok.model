item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues decreased to million from million 
this decline was primarily due to a decrease in revenue from leasing operations to million from million  as a result of our decision in march to discontinue actively seeking new leasing business and to commence the winding down of our leasing portfolio 
the trend of reduced leasing revenues will continue over the next year depending on the size and duration of renewals 
revenues from corporate help desk services increased to million from million  due to growth in business with our existing customers  primarily ford motor company and new business acquired with the cyntergy asset acquisition in september revenues from systems integration services grew  to million from million  primarily due to growth of our customer base associated with the cyntergy acquisition 
revenues from technical staffing decreased to million from million principally as the result of price concessions granted to existing customers and reductions in placements 
revenue from the provision of training programs declined to million from million  primarily due to discontinuance of training contracts with sun microsystems  inc and with one of our major automotive customers 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit margins from our leasing operations  to in from in these benefits were partially offset by the gross margin reduction for corporate services to from 
within the corporate services product segment  the corporate help desk services margin decreased to in from in primarily due to increased cost of sales in expanding the customer use of the support portal  technical staffing decreased to from due primarily to price concessions granted to existing customers  systems integration gross margin decreased to in from in as we invested in integrating the newly acquired cyntergy customers 
these decreases in corporate services gross margins decreases were partially offset by the training gross margin increase to in from in selling  general  and administrative sg a expense declined to million in from million in the expense decrease is partially due to aggressive cost containment efforts and expense reduction initiatives undertaken during that reduced facility expenses by  outside services expense by  employee recruiting expense by  legal fees by  and payroll and benefits expense by  these decreases were partially offset by increases for depreciation expense of  travel expense of  and the non cash charge of  resulting from the variable stock option grant made to our president and chief executive officer  pursuant to an employment agreement entered into on august  also  we adopted sfas as of january  consequently  we did not amortize goodwill during we recognized  in goodwill amortization expense during  which was recorded as sg a expense 
the million of sg a expense in also included expense of  to increase the capabilities of the support portal for expanded use  a net settlement of  related to earn out and release agreements with former officers of techteam capital group  higher bad debt expense of  severance payments of  for terminated administrative employees  intangible amortization expense of  write offs of  for remaining goodwill and equity interest of prior acquisitions determined to be impaired  an  loss on disposal of assets due to the closing of a call center office  and a  loss related to the write off of a vendor supply agreement no longer being used 
in addition  a  write down was taken due to our decision to cease making payments on insurance contracts for an officer of the company 
the company s michigan single business tax expense increased  to  in  from  in  due primarily to a higher tax apportionment factor  for us operations only  for michigan 
interest income declined to  in from  in as a result of reduced returns from our cash investments 
the decline in our investment yield is consistent with the overall decline in short term market interest rates and returns 
interest expense decreased significantly  to  from  primarily due to the continuing reduction in outstanding debt  related to our leasing operations 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease resulted primarily from revenue decreases in corporate help desk services of million  leasing operations of million  technical staffing services of million  system integration services of million  and training services of million 
corporate help desk services revenues were reduced due largely to the company selling its interest in the ge joint venture and ceasing to provide services to the new owner of the joint venture in revenues from leasing operations decreased due to our decision to cease looking for new leasing opportunities 
systems integration revenues decreased due mainly to a reduction in computer upgrade and installation work at an automotive client as well as the completion of systems work at two smaller customers in technical staffing revenues decreased in large part due to our two major automotive customers making cuts in subcontracted staffing to reduce their cost structure 
training revenues decreased mostly due to the discontinuance of our training contract with sun microsystems  inc and a reduction in services provided to one of our major automotive customers 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in from in the decrease was due to a series of factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  a net loss from the sale of equipment coming off lease of million in as compared to a gain of million in  an increase in our residual reserve of million to million  the reduction in revenues in the company s leasing operations  a reduction in revenues in the corporate help desk services  and a reduction of gross profit margin in the corporate help desk services due primarily to the effects of a fourth quarter acquisition 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in the million in includes a net settlement of  related to earn out and release agreements with former officers of techteam capital group  severance payments of  for administrative employees that were terminated  write offs of  for remaining goodwill and equity interest of prior acquisitions determined to be impaired  an  loss on disposal of assets due to the closing of a call center office  and a  loss related to the write off of a vendor supply agreement no longer being used 
in addition  a  write down was taken due to our decision to cease making payments on insurance contracts for an officer of the company 
without these items  selling  general  and administrative costs would have decreased by approximately  in from the michigan single business tax decreased in primarily because in the company reversed certain tax credits that we had previously expected to receive 
interest income increased to million in from million in  due to an improved cash position  which resulted from our decision to no longer underwrite new leasing business 
interest expense decreased due to the reduction in the outstanding notes payable related to the leasing business 
we recognized an income tax credit of million on a pretax loss of million in the consolidated income tax provision is due to the combination of a net income tax credit from us operations  offset in part by an income tax expense from european operations 
our effective tax rates for the european operations are not significantly different than the statutory rates 
our effective tax rate for the us operations differs from the statutory tax rate primarily due to nondeductible goodwill and other intangible asset amortization 
critical accounting policies and estimates deferred income taxes at december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  primarily related to alternative minimum tax credit carry forwards in the united states  which do not expire 
realization of the deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
based on historical and expected future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
if at any time we believe that current or future taxable income will not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance would be provided 
inventories inventories consist of equipment retained by the company s leasing operations subsequent to the end of the lease term and intended for resale 
such off lease equipment is valued at the lower of estimated market value at lease termination or current market value 
the values of inventories are impacted by a number of factors  including the speed of technological change and the secondary market for used computer equipment 
valuation reserves against depreciated costs of off lease equipment inventories amounted to million at december   million at december   and  at december  substantially all of the net increases in these reserves resulted from transfers from the leased asset reserve account as the equipment comes off lease and is transferred into inventories 
the net inventories balance of million at december  is of the original cost of the equipment 
equipment returned prior to december  is fully reserved  ie  carried at a net book value of zero 
inventories net of reserve include approximately  worth of equipment returned in and approximately million returned in leased assets we periodically review our estimate of residual values of leased assets  which consist principally of computer equipment 
the values of the leased assets are impacted by a number of factors  including the speed of technological change  the secondary market for used computer equipment  the disposition of customers towards lease renewals  and our ability to offer structured alternatives to our customers 
valuation reserves against depreciated cost of leased equipment amounted to million at december  and million at december  substantially all of the net decreases in such reserves resulted from the lease terms ending and the equipment being sold or transferred to inventories 
the net leased equipment amount of million represents approximately of its original cost 
there can be no assurance that our estimates of residual values will accurately reflect future results 
accounts receivable we periodically review our accounts receivable balances for collectibility based on a combination of historical experience and existing economic conditions 
the definition of delinquent accounts is based on the governing contractual terms 
delinquent accounts and balances are written off when we determine they are uncollectible 
our customers are generally large  well capitalized entities 
we generally do not require collateral 
as our leasing portfolio winds down  additional collection challenges may be encountered 
allowances against accounts receivable amounted to  at december  and  at december  the accounts receivable balance for the leasing operations segment at december  amounted to million  less an allowance of  we have reduced our days sales outstanding from days at june  to days at december  there can be no assurance that our estimates of collectibility will accurately reflect future results 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided from operations cash provided from operating activities was million for the year ended december  a significant source of operating cash flow was the leasing business  as cash rental income and non cash depreciation and amortization expense comprise substantially all of the operating activities 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  of which million came from our leasing operations 
we believe that cash flows provided from operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our ongoing working capital requirements 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  we used million to purchase assets to be used in the provision of customer services and used a net amount of million to purchase marketable securities 
we received million from the sale of assets used in leasing operations 
cash used in financing activities cash used in financing activities was million 
we used million to pay down debt related to our leasing operations and million to purchase company stock 
we received million from the issuance of common stock related to the exercise of stock options 
effects of accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
in the fourth quarter of  techteam announced that million of goodwill related to leasing operations would become impaired after adoption of sfas as of january  we adopted sfas accordingly  we took an impairment charge of million in the first quarter of under sfas  the charge recognized upon adoption of the statement is reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and was adopted by the company on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our reported results of operations or our financial position 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in sfas is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  sfas eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue and establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
fasb is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  techteam does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a significant impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas that amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and to require disclosure of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas does not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  accordingly  techteam has continued to elect to account for employee stock options under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and its related interpretations 
the effect of adopting sfas had no material effect except for the quarterly disclosure provisions  which will be made in our march  interim financial statements 
factors influencing future results some of the information in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
you can identify these statements by their inclusion of such forward looking words as may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  estimate  forecast  intend  promise  should  conditioned upon  project  predict  continue  and similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss our future expectations and may contain projections of our future results of operations or of our financial condition or state other forward looking information 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
however  there will be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or over which we will have no control 
the risk factors listed in this section as well as any other cautionary language in this report  provide examples of just a few of the many risks  uncertainties  and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this report  or in our other publicly filed reports that we may file from time to time  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
in addition  any one or more of the risks outlined below could have a greater or lesser impact on our business at any particular point in time and you should not give any greater or lesser emphasis or weight to any single factor merely by virtue of the order of its presentation or the depth of its discussion in this report 
impact of business with major clients as set forth in item business  we depend upon major clients in the us automotive industry for a substantial portion of our revenues 
the past two years have been difficult financially for our automotive clients  and further deterioration of their financial condition could have a material adverse impact on our business as they may seek further price concessions or the termination of projects 
similarly  the loss of any significant customer or a reduction in economic activity in the us automotive industry would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks inherent in leasing the techteam capital group leasing portfolio is largely wound down  and we anticipate that we will be receiving less than million in contractually committed lease revenue from the portfolio during however  as the actual amount of revenue is dependent upon the renewals that we receive  and we cannot predict the number of renewals that we will receive  the actual revenue we receive could be greater 
yet  we will continue to receive equipment from the lessees as it returns off lease  and it is difficult to determine the value of this equipment at the expiration of the lease 
if we are able to sell the equipment to the original lessee or to others quickly  our proceeds are usually greater than we would otherwise receive by disposing of these assets through other means 
accordingly  variations in lease renewals and in the sale price of off lease equipment will lead to fluctuations in the performance of techteam capital group  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
competition we face intense competition in all of our markets and for all of our services  including the help desk and call center services markets 
some competitors have substantially greater resources  including more locations  greater financial resources  a larger client base  and greater name recognition 
these customers may be willing to provide the same services that we do at a loss in order to attain other  more lucrative business with our customers 
due to this competition  it may be difficult for us to grow our revenue outside of our current customer base 
also  as a result  we have experienced and continue to anticipate significant downward pricing pressure from our customers in order to remain a preferred vendor 
these pressures will likely increase due to the trend to move outsourcing services off shore to countries with lower labor costs  such as india and the philippines 
our inability to develop and execute a strategy to address the globalization of the support services market could have a material adverse impact on our ability to maintain and grow our current customers and expand our customer base 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
contract risks the great majority of our non leasing related contracts  including our global help desk contract with ford motor company  may be terminated without cause on short notice  often upon as little as days notice 
terminations and non renewals of major contracts could have a material adverse impact upon our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
moreover  increasing portions of our projects are billed on a managed service basis where the fee is fixed to perform specified services as opposed to time and materials 
while we have successfully managed our resources to date  the onset of problems in our customers infrastructure  such as a computer virus  may require us to deploy additional resources to solve the problem 
in many instances  we would not receive any additional revenue for the work performed 
our inability to estimate accurately the resources and related expenses required for the managed service project or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the contractual obligations upon which a fixed fee contract was based could materially and adversely affect the business 
reliance on senior management the success of the company is highly dependent upon the efforts  direction  and guidance of its senior management 
the only employment agreements that we currently have with the executive officers of the company are with the president and chief executive officer and the vice president europe 
we do not have any other employment agreements with other members of our executive officer team 
the loss of any of these senior executives or our inability to attract  retain  or replace key management personnel in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
attraction and retention of employees our business involves the delivery of professional services and is very labor intensive 
our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract  develop  motivate  and retain highly skilled technical  clerical  and administrative employees 
qualified personnel are in high demand 
accordingly  we expect to experience increased compensation costs that may not be offset through either increased productivity or higher customer pricing 
moreover  no assurances can be given that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees in the future  especially when we need to expand our services in a short time period 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
interruption of telecommunications and network our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technical support centers and our information databases against damages that may be caused by fire and other disasters  power failure  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion  computer viruses  and other emergencies 
the temporary or permanent loss of such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
notwithstanding precautions we have taken to protect ourself and our clients from events that could interrupt delivery of our services  there can be no assurance that a fire  natural disaster  human error  equipment malfunction or inadequacy  computer virus  firewall breach  or other event would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients 
any interruption to our data network could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  and our results of operations 
our primary telecommunications service provider is worldcom  which is currently operating under the provisions of chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
while we have created redundant networks  and the united states government has indicated that they will not allow worldcom to cease operations  there are no assurances that our telecommunications services will continue without interruption 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
technological changes  dependence on technology and computer systems our success depends in part on our ability to develop it solutions that keep pace with continuing changes in it  evolving industry standards  and changing client preferences 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in adequately addressing these developments on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  we will be successful in the marketplace 
for example  our support portal offering is comprised of our proprietary incident management tool and software developed and sold by software companies 
over the past three years  we have integrated this software into the support portal 
during this time  there have been other tools developed by other competitors and software vendors that can match the functionality of the support portal 
if these other tools can provide similar or better functionality at a lower effective cost  we could have a product and service offering that will lose its marketability 
our inability to keep pace with continuing changes in the it industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
management of growth our business strategy includes the attainment of significant growth through expanding our customer base and through the company s potential acquisitions 
any time there is significant growth from new customers  there are risks associated with the launch and management of new projects  including but not limited to  proper project management  staff development  and scoping of the work 
acquisitions involve special risks  including  but not limited to  the diversion of management s attention  the inability to integrate the acquired business into our operations  the loss of key business and or personnel from the acquired company  unanticipated events  legal liabilities  and dilutive effect of the issuance of additional securities  and amortization of intangibles 
moreover  the financial risks continue after the integration of the company 
if the business becomes impaired  there could be a non cash partial or full write off of the goodwill attributed to the acquisition 
any of these possible difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with international operations certain risks are inherent in our business strategy  which includes plans for the global expansion of our operations 
we may encounter difficulties in marketing  selling  and delivering our services outside the united states due to  among other things  differences in cultures  languages  labor and employment policies  and differing political and social systems 
in addition  our business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially affected as a result of currency fluctuations and differing tax laws in countries other than the united states 
any of these possibilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks in offshore markets while we do not have any current offshore ie  far eastern or indian capabilities  we intend to pursue opportunities in offshore markets 
there are no assurances that we will be able to successfully expand into and conduct business in offshore markets 
the industry trend to move business towards offshore markets could result in the company s having excess operating capacity in the united states 
moreover  the success of any offshore operation is subject to numerous contingencies  some of which are beyond management control  including general and regional economic conditions  prices for our services  competition  changes in regulation  and other risks 
any failure in our strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
health care and other benefit costs health care and other benefit costs continue to increase 
while we attempt to compensate for these escalating costs in our business cost models and customer pricing and have passed along some of these increased costs to our employees  we have long term  generally fixed price pricing agreements with our customers 
limited protection of proprietary systems and procedures we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and trade secrets  copyright  and trademark laws to protect our proprietary rights and the proprietary rights of third parties from whom we license intellectual property 
we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and limit distribution of proprietary information 
there can be no assurance  however  that the steps taken by us in this regard will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use of such information and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
although we believe our services and or software do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others and that we have all of the rights necessary to utilize the intellectual property employed in our business  we are subject to the risk of litigation alleging infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
any such claims could require us to spend significant sums of money in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses of the intellectual property  which may be the subject of asserted infringement 
volatility of stock price the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range during the past several years and may continue to do so in the future 
see item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to various factors or events  including  among other things  the depth and liquidity of the trading market for our common stock  quarterly variations in our operating results  actual versus anticipated operating results  growth rates  market conditions in the industry in which we compete  announcements by competitors  regulatory actions  litigation including class action litigation and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology companies 
as a result of the foregoing  our operating results and future prospects at various times may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have any material market risk sensitive financial instruments 
substantially all of our operations are located in the united states 
our debt obligations have fixed interest rates and relatively short lives 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk  inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
currently  we have two principle areas of foreign currency exposure that could result in short term variations in earnings 
we have dollar denominated loan balances and inter company balances with our foreign subsidiaries  and one of our foreign subsidiaries has a contract with a customer which requires sales to be billed in us dollars  while our related expenditures are primarily denominated in euros
