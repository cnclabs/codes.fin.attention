such statements are based on information available to management as of the time of such statements and relate to  among other things  expectations of the business environment in which the company operates  projections of future performance  perceived opportunities in the market and statements regarding the company s mission and vision 
forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to differ materially from anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
the future operating results and performance trends of the company may be affected by a number of factors  including  without limitation  those described under risk factors below 
those risk factors  and other risks  uncertainties and assumptions identified from time to time in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission  including without limitation  its quarterly reports on form q and its registration statements  could cause the company s actual future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth in the company s various filings with the securities and exchange commission and of changes in general economic conditions  changes in interest rates and or exchange rates and changes in the assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
risk factors the company s dependence on new product development and the rapid technological change that characterizes the company s industry make it susceptible to loss of market share resulting from competitors product introductions and similar risks 
the communications technology sector is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  short product life cycles and rapidly changing customer requirements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its existing products  to introduce new products to meet changing customer requirements and emerging technologies  and to demonstrate the performance advantages and cost effectiveness of its products over competing products 
any failure by the company to modify its products to support new alternative technologies or any failure to achieve widespread customer acceptance of such modified products could cause the company to lose market share and cause its revenues to decline 
the company may experience delays in developing and marketing product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards and changing customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued development  introduction  and marketing of these products or product enhancements  or that its new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve any significant or sustainable degree of market acceptance in existing or additional markets 
failure by the company  for technological or other reasons  to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the future introductions or announcements of products by the company or one of its competitors embodying new technologies or changes in industry standards or customer requirements could render the company s then existing products obsolete or unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that the introduction or announcement of new product offerings by the company or one or more of its competitors will not cause customers to defer the purchase of the company s existing products  which could cause its revenues to decline 
the company intends to continue to devote significant resources to its research and development  which  if not successful  could cause a decline in its revenues and harm its business 
the company intends to continue to devote significant resources to research and development in the coming years to enhance and develop additional products 
for the fiscal years ended   and  the company s research and development expenses comprised   and  respectively  of total net sales 
if the company is unable to develop new products as a result of its research and development efforts  or if the products the company develops are not successful  its business could be harmed 
even if the company develops new products that are accepted by its target markets  the net revenues from these products may not be sufficient to justify its investment in research and development 
a substantial portion of the company s recent development efforts have been directed toward the development of new products targeted to manufacturers of intelligent  network enabled devices and other embedded systems in various markets  including markets in which networking solutions for embedded systems have not historically been sold  such as markets for industrial automation equipment and security equipment 
the company s financial performance is dependent upon the development of the intelligent device markets that the company is targeting  and the company s ability to successfully compete and sell its products to manufacturers of these intelligent devices 
certain of the company s products that generate a substantial amount of its revenue are sold into mature markets  which could limit the company s ability to generate revenue from these products 
certain of the company s products provide asynchronous and synchronous data transmissions via add on cards 
the market for add on asynchronous and synchronous data communications cards is mature 
furthermore  certain applications of the company s embedded network interface cards are also considered mature 
asynchronous  synchronous  and network interface cards currently generate approximately of the company s revenues 
as the overall market for these products decreases due to the adoption of new technologies  the company expects that its revenues from these products will continue to decline 
as a result  the company s future prospects depend in large part on its ability to acquire or develop and successfully market additional products that address growth markets 
the company s failure to effectively manage product transitions could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
from time to time  the company or its competitors may announce new products  capabilities  or technologies that may replace or shorten the life cycles of the company s existing products 
announcements of currently 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued planned or other new products may cause customers to defer or stop purchasing the company s products until new products become available 
furthermore  the introduction of new or enhanced products requires the company to manage the transition from older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demand 
the company s failure to effectively manage transitions from older products could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
the company s failure to compete successfully in its highly competitive market could result in reduced prices and loss of market share 
the market in which the company operates is characterized by rapid technological advances and evolving industry standards 
the market can be significantly affected by new product introductions and marketing activities of industry participants 
the company competes for customers on the basis of product performance in relation to compatibility  support  quality and reliability  product development capabilities  price  and availability 
certain of the company s competitors and potential competitors may have greater financial  technological  manufacturing  marketing  and personnel resources than the company 
present and future competitors may be able to identify new markets and develop products more quickly  which are superior to those developed by the company 
they may also adapt new technologies faster  devote greater resources to research and development  promote products more aggressively  and price products more competitively than the company 
there are no assurances that competition will not intensify or that the company will be able to compete effectively in the markets in which the company competes 
the cyclicality of the semiconductor industry may result in substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results 
the company s semiconductor products provide networking capabilities for intelligent  network enabled devices and other embedded systems 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and subject to rapid technological change and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and production overcapacity 
the semiconductor industry also periodically experiences increased demand and production capacity constraints 
as a result  the company may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
the company s concentrated customer base increases the potential adverse effect on the company from the loss of one or more customers 
the company s products have historically been sold into highly concentrated customer markets 
two customers  who are distributors of the companies products  comprised more than of net sales each during the fiscal years ended   and tech data at   and  respectively  and ingram micro at   and  respectively 
the company s sales are primarily made on the basis of purchase orders rather than under long term agreements  and therefore  any customer could cease purchasing the company s products at any time without penalty 
the decision of any key customer to cease using the company s products or a material decline in the number of units purchased by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s revenues 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued the long and variable sales cycle for certain of the company s products makes it more difficult for the company to predict its operating results and manage its business 
the sale of the company s products typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by potential customers and end users  as well as delays frequently associated with end users internal procedures to deploy new technologies within their products and to test and accept new technologies 
for these and other reasons  the sales cycle associated with certain of the company s products is typically lengthy and is subject to a number of significant risks  including end users internal purchasing reviews  that are beyond the company s control 
because of the lengthy sales cycle and the large size of customer orders  if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  the company s operating results for that quarter could be materially adversely affected 
the company depends on manufacturing relationships and on limited source suppliers  and any disruptions in these relationships may cause damage to the company s customer relationships 
the company procures all parts and certain services involved in the production of its products and subcontracts most of its product manufacturing to outside firms that specialize in such services 
although most of the components of the company s products are available from multiple vendors  the company has several single source supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or because the relationship is advantageous to the company 
there can be no assurance that the company s suppliers will be able to meet the company s future requirements for products and components in a timely fashion 
in addition  the availability of many of these components to the company is dependent in part on the company s ability to provide its suppliers with accurate forecasts of its future requirements 
delays or lost sales could be caused by other factors beyond the company s control  including late deliveries by vendors of components 
if the company is required to identify alternative suppliers for any of its required components  qualification and pre production periods could be lengthy and may cause an increase in component costs and delays in providing products to customers 
any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from limited sources could disrupt the company s operations and have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships and profitability 
the company s use of suppliers in southeast asia involves risks that could negatively impact the company 
the company uses suppliers in southeast asia 
product delivery times may be extended due to the distances involved  requiring more lead time in ordering 
in addition  ocean freight delays may occur as a result of labor problems  weather delays or expediting and customs issues 
any extended delay in receipt of the component parts could eliminate anticipated cost savings and have a material adverse effect on the company s customer relationships and profitability 
the company s ability to compete could be jeopardized if the company is unable to protect its intellectual property rights 
the company s ability to compete depends in part on its proprietary rights and technology 
although the company has certain patents and patent applications and may seek additional patents where appropriate for proprietary technology  the company s proprietary technology and products are generally not patented 
the company relies primarily on the copyright  trademark  and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary rights in its products 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued the company enters into confidentiality agreements with all employees  and sometimes with its customers and potential customers  and limits access to the distribution of its proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company in this regard will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of its technology 
the company s pending patent applications may be denied and any patents  once issued  may be circumvented by the company s competitors 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not develop technologies that are superior to the company s technologies 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that the company s means of protecting its proprietary rights in the united states or abroad will be adequate or that competing companies will not independently develop similar technology 
the company s failure to adequately protect its proprietary rights could have a material adverse effect on the company s competitive position and result in loss of revenue 
from time to time  the company is subject to claims and litigation regarding intellectual property rights  which could seriously harm the company and require the company to incur significant costs 
the communications technology sector is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
from time to time  the company receives notification of a third party claim that its products infringe other intellectual property rights 
any litigation to determine the validity of third party infringement claims  whether or not determined in the company s favor or settled by the company  may be costly and divert the efforts and attention of the company s management and technical personnel from productive tasks  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s ability to operate its business and service the needs of its customers 
there can be no assurance that any infringement claims by third parties  if proven to have merit  will not materially adversely affect the company s business or financial condition 
in the event of an adverse ruling in any such matter  the company may be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or be required to obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on the company s ability to market its products  or delays and costs associated with redesigning its products or payments of license fees to third parties  or any failure by the company to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition 
the company faces risks associated with its international operations and expansion that could impair its ability to grow its revenues abroad 
in the fiscal years ended september    and  net sales to customers outside the united states were approximately   and  respectively  of total net sales 
the company believes that its future growth is dependent in part upon its ability to increase sales in international markets 
these sales are subject to a variety of risks  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  tariffs  import restrictions and other trade barriers  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and potentially adverse tax consequences  and export license requirements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors continued in addition  the company is subject to the risks inherent in conducting business internationally  including political and economic instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships 
there can be no assurance that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business strategy and financial condition 
if the company loses key personnel it could prevent the company from executing its business strategy 
the company s business and prospects depend to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of its executive officers and its key technical personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could result in the company s failure to execute its business strategy 
any acquisitions the company has made or will make could disrupt its business and seriously harm its financial condition 
the company will continue to consider acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies 
in the event of any future purchases  the company could issue stock that would dilute the company s current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  or incur large and immediate write offs 
the company s operation of any acquired business will also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies  or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from the company s core business  difficulties integrating businesses in different countries and cultures  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that the company has acquired or that the company might acquire in the future and any failure to do so could disrupt its business and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  from time to time the company may enter into negotiations for a proposed acquisition  but be unable or unwilling to consummate the acquisition under consideration 
this could cause significant diversion of management s attention and out of pocket expenses to the company 
the company could also be exposed to litigation as a result of an unconsummated acquisition  including claims that it failed to negotiate in good faith or misappropriated confidential information

essentially  the new policy recognizes that the risks and rewards of ownership in certain transactions do not substantively transfer to customers upon shipment of the products 
these new policies are consistent with the guidance contained in sab the effect of this change in revenue recognition policy  as of october   was reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal of million  net of taxes  which includes revenue of approximately million  less cost of sales and certain direct selling expenses

acquired in process research and development on february   the company acquired netsilicon  a provider of silicon based embedded networking solutions  for a purchase price of million 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
included in the purchase price allocation was a million charge to acquired in process research and development 
at the time of acquisition  netsilicon had two development projects in process  the net microprocessor subsequently renamed the microprocessor and the net os v 
software suite 
the project involved the design and development of a low cost  high performance networking microprocessor 
the net os v 
project included significant and innovative advancements to the netsilicon software platform in the areas of security  management and ease of use 
the design  verification and other processes involved in the project required tools and skills that were new to netsilicon 
similarly  the advanced and innovative features being developed for inclusion in the net os v software platform differed from existing net os features 
accordingly  the company was uncertain whether the technology being developed could become commercially viable 
if these products were not successfully developed  the sales and profitability of the company would be adversely affected in future periods 
additionally  the value of other identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired could become impaired 
management estimated that million of the purchase price represented the fair value of purchased in process research and development related to the chip and the net os v 
software platform referred to above  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future uses 
this amount was expensed as a nonrecurring  non tax deductible charge upon consummation of the acquisition 
the company engaged a third party appraiser to apply the income valuation approach to assist the company in determining the estimated fair value of the purchased in process research and development 
these estimates were based on the following assumptions the estimated revenues were based upon netsilicon s estimate of revenue growth over the next four fiscal years from the revenue growth of primarily the net os v 
and the chips 
the estimated gross margin of was based upon historical gross margin for netsilicon s products  which include chips  boards  and development kits 
the estimated selling  general and administrative expenses were based on consideration of historical operating expenses as a percentage of sales and netsilicon s projected operating expenses 
cost to complete each project was based on estimated remaining labor hours and a fully burdened labor cost  and other direct project expenses 
the discount rate used in the alternative income valuation approach was based on the weighted average cost of capital wacc 
the wacc calculation produces the average required rate of return of an investment in an operating enterprise  based on various required rates of return from investments in various areas of that enterprise 
the discount rate used in the alternative valuation approach was 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued acquired in process research and development continued premiums were added to the wacc to account for the inherent risks in the development of the products  the risks of the products being completed on schedule  and the risk of the eventual sales of the product meeting the expectations of the company 
the following rates of return were used for the in process research and development products net os v 
the chip was released for production in january this chip is a derivative product capturing the price target and substantially all of the technology contemplated in the product family at the time of acquisition 
the company expects that revenue from the family may be less than originally projected at the time of the valuation  due primarily to a decline in economic conditions after the acquisition 
however  the company anticipates that revenue from the product family will represent approximately the same percentage of total company revenue as that originally projected 
net os v 
was released to production in november in september  the company released the next version of this product  the net os v 
the company anticipates that the projected revenue from the net os v 
and its successor product  the net os v 
will be in line with original projections 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
loss on sale of milan assets on march   the company sold substantially all of the assets of its former milan technology division milan to communications systems  inc csi for million  resulting in a pre tax loss of million million net of taxes 
included in the net loss on this transaction is million of severance costs related to certain former employees of milan 
gain from forgiveness of grant payable in connection with the acquisition of itk international  inc itk in july  the company assumed a liability for an investment grant payable of  to the german government relating to construction of the itk facility in dortmund  germany 
the investment grant contained a provision that the grant would be forgiven if itk retained a specified number of employees in the facility for a five year period 
because itk was not in compliance with the minimum employment requirements of the grant at the time of the acquisition or subsequent to the acquisition  the company continued to reflect the grant payable as a liability and continued to accrue interest on the principal balance of the grant

recent accounting developments in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses accounting for special purpose and variable interest entities 
this interpretation is effective for financial statements issued after december  in september  the fasb issued a staff position to allow a deferment of the effective date to the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  if certain conditions are met 
companies that defer implementation are required to make additional disclosures in financial statements issued between the original effective date and the date that interpretation no 
is applied 
the company has adopted the provisions of this interpretation 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the values of purchased assets and assumed liabilities in acquisitions 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition continued critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition the company s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of products to its distributors and oem customers  and to a lesser extent from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training and engineering services and royalties 
the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and there are no post delivery obligations other than warranty 
under these criteria  product revenue is generally recognized upon shipment of product to customers  including oems and distributors 
in some of the company s transactions prior to march of  risks and rewards of ownership were deferred until customer receipt of the product shipped 
during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a distribution agreement with a new distributor 
the company has no prior history with this distributor upon which to base estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments 
under this arrangement  product deliveries will be recognized as revenue when the products are sold by this distributor through to the end user customer  until the company has adequate historical experience to estimate sales returns and pricing adjustments  at which time sales will be recognized upon shipment to this distributor 
as of september   there had been no sales to end user customers 
sales to all other authorized domestic distributors and oems are made with certain rights of return and price protection provisions 
estimated reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments are established by the company based on an analysis of historical patterns of returns and price protection claims as well as an analysis of authorized returns compared to received returns  current on hand inventory at distributors  and distribution sales for the current period 
estimated reserves for future returns and price protection are charged against revenues in the same period as the corresponding sales are recorded 
material differences between the historical trends used to determine estimated reserves and actual returns and pricing adjustments could result in a material change to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company has applied consistent methodologies for estimating reserves for future returns and pricing adjustments for all years presented 
the company offers rebates to authorized domestic and international distributors and authorized resellers 
the rebates are incurred based on the level of sales the respective distributors and resellers make to end user customers  and are charged to operations as a reduction in revenue in the same period as the corresponding sales 
the company also generates revenue from the sale of software licenses  fees associated with technical support  training  professional and engineering services  and royalties 
revenue from software maintenance obligations is deferred and recognized at the time the service is provided or over the life of the underlying service or support contract  if applicable 
unearned software maintenance and unearned nonrecurring engineering services revenue is included in deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
generally  the company recognizes revenue under agreements for nonrecurring engineering services using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of actual labor hours incurred to total estimated labor hours for individual contracts 
however  the company defers revenues from nonrecurring engineering services until delivery if  at the inception of the arrangement  there is uncertainty about delivery and or the costs of delivery cannot be accurately estimated 
the company s software development tools and developments boards often include multiple elements hardware  software  post contract customer support pcs  limited training and basic hardware design review 
the company s customers purchase these products and services during their product development process in which they use the tools to build network connectivity into the devices they are manufacturing 
the company recognizes revenue related to these multiple element arrangements in accordance with statement of position 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting practices continued revenue recognition continued sop no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of certain provisions of sop revenue related to the sale of these development products is allocated to the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value as determined by the price charged for each element when sold separately 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts  which reflects the estimate of losses that may result from the inability of some of the company s customers to make required payments 
the estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on known circumstances regarding collectibility of customer accounts and historical collections experience 
if the financial condition of one or more of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences between the historical trends used to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts and actual collection experience could result in a material change to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
fair value for raw materials is based on replacement cost and for other inventory classifications based on net realizable value 
the company reduces the carrying value of its inventories for estimated excess and obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if actual product demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could result in a material change to the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
the company has applied consistent methodologies for the net realizable value of inventories 
intangible assets purchased proven technology  license agreements  covenants not to compete and other intangible assets are recorded at fair value when acquired in a business acquisition  or at cost when not purchased in a business combination 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and  effective october   is no longer amortized pursuant to fas no 
however  goodwill is subject to an impairment assessment at least annually which may result in a charge to operations if the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill is reported declines 
purchased in process research and development costs ipr d are expensed upon consummation of the related business acquisition 
all other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of four to ten years 
useful lives for intangible assets are estimated at the time of acquisition based on the periods of time from which the company expects to derive benefits from the intangible assets 
methods of amortization reflect the pattern in which the asset is consumed 
intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s undiscounted expected future cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value amount 
the company measures impairment loss by utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting practices continued intangible assets continued technique using fair values indicated by the income approach 
impairment losses  if any  are recorded currently 
to the extent that the company s undiscounted future cash flows were to decline substantially  such an impairment charge could result 
there are certain assumptions inherent in projecting the recoverability of the company s intangible assets and fair value of goodwill 
if actual experience differs from the assumptions made the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company could be materially impacted 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment for its netsilicon and inside out networks reporting units as of june  since the calculated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded book value  there was no impairment identified

 accounting for income taxes fas 
the amount of deferred tax assets and liabilities actually realized could be impacted by differences in the timing or amount of future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities or changes in the amounts of future taxable income 
if management determines that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  a valuation allowance would be required  and would be reflected as income tax expense at the time that any such change in estimated future taxable income is determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk from market sensitive financial instruments is primarily related to currency risk associated with certain sales transactions being denominated in euros or japanese yen and fluctuations of the euro and japanese yen as the financial position and operating results of the company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
the company minimizes exposure to currency risk due to fluctuations in exchange rates by matching foreign denominated payment obligations with foreign denominated receipts to the extent possible 
during  the average monthly exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar increased by approximately from 
to and the average monthly exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar increased by approximately from 
to 
a change from the average exchange rate for the euro to the us dollar would have resulted in a change in annual net sales and a change in net loss for the year ended september  a change from the average exchange rate for the japanese yen to the us dollar would have resulted in a change in annual net sales and a change in net loss for the year ended september  the company has some exposure to credit risk related to its accounts receivable portfolio 
exposure to credit risk is controlled through regular monitoring of customer financial status  credit limits and collaboration with sales management on customer contacts to facilitate payment 
borrowings under the company s short term borrowing and line of credit agreements bear interest at fixed rates 
the interest rate on the outstanding short term borrowing of  currently due on january   is subject to change in the event the company elects to extend the term of the borrowing based upon market rates in effect at the time of extension
