these risks include  but are not limited to  the continuing losses of the company which may result in the need for additional capital in the future or a change in current operations  the need for substantial capital and use of current working capital to develop new products and for research and development  uncertainty of product development  technological obsolescence  market acceptance of its products and dependence on third party suppliers and distributors 
the company may also have to expend substantial employee time and financial resources to meet governmental regulation requirements and for the protection of its intellectual property rights

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its significant estimates  which include allowance for bad debts  inventory reserves  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes that the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements o the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
for product sales  these criteria are generally met at the time product is shipped 
at the time revenue is recognized  the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties 
for training and other service revenue  the company recognizes revenue as the services are complete and the company has no significant remaining obligation to the customer 
revenue from multi element support contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the agreement  generally one year 
o the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
o the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  a revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
o the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
o the company estimates the economic lives of its long lived assets  including patents and other intangibles and evaluates the need for impairment of these assets based on the difference between the cost of the asset and the sum of estimated future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if actual future cash flows are less favorable than those projected by management  an impairment charge may be required 
general the company has made significant investments in developing the technology and manufacturing capability for its products  the returns on which are dependent upon the generation of future revenues for realization 
the company has not yet generated revenues sufficient to offset its operating expenses 
to date the company has used the proceeds from the sale of its equity securities to fund its operations 
the company anticipates increases in revenues in these increases are subject to the company continuing to expand its product lines and attracting additional means of distribution and customers  among other things 
the company intends to continue to use its working capital to support future marketing and sales and research and development activities for its products 
no assurance can be given that such expenditures will result in increased sales  new products  or technological advances or that the company has adequate capital to complete its products or gain market acceptance before requiring additional capital 
results of operations for each of the three years ended december   and revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the company s revenues to date have been generated entirely by its video division 
revenues generated by the company s major product lines  including service and support related to those products  as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and are as follows pvtv systems cameraman systems support and other services the number of pvtv and stand alone cameraman systems sold and the average selling price per system for the years ended december   and were as follows pvtv systems camera systems avg 
selling avg 
selling systems price per systems price per sold system sold system the  increase in revenues from to was due to a significant increase in pvtv system sales and related services  offset by an approximate decline in revenues from camera system sales 
the company believes the increase in pvtv system revenue is due to growing market acceptance of the pvtv automated production system among broadcasters 
in addition  the average selling price per pvtv system increased from approximately  in to  in due to the sale of higher end systems in larger broadcast markets 
the decline in camera revenues from to was anticipated with the company s announcement of the discontinuation of its single chip camera line early in the company s decision to discontinue this product line resulted from supply issues  declining demand and an increased focus on development and marketing of the pvtv systems 
although the overall camera unit sales declined  the average selling price per system increased from  to  per system 
this increase is due to an increase in the percentage of three chip unit sales from approximately of total camera sales in to approximately in the company plans to continue to market and sell its three chip camera products in broadcast  education and corporate environments 
the  decrease in revenues from to was due to a decline in sales of both major product lines 
the decline in camera sales was primarily due to reduced sales to forgent corporation  formerly vtel corporation vtel 
the company believes this resulted from the restructuring of vtel during which ended with the spin off of vtel s product division in march in addition to the decline in vtel sales  the company s single chip camera sales declined overall 
the company believes this was caused by increased pricing pressure from competing technologies as well as the company s decision to focus its sales and marketing efforts on its pvtv product line 
the decrease in revenue from pvtv products was due to a decline in group sales revenue in in comparison with  as well as a decrease in the average selling price per system 
in  the company recognized revenue on nine systems sold to the ackerley group ackerley which accounted for approximately of the company s total revenue in the company received purchase contracts from two broadcast ownership groups in for a total of stations  however  because of customer installation schedules  only three of these systems were delivered in the remaining systems were delivered in the decrease in the average selling price per system from to is due to increased sales of the lower end pvtv systems  and decreased sales of dual system packages which have a higher selling price per installation 
to date  the company has not generated revenues from its wireless division 
while the company strives for consistent revenue growth  there can be no assurance that consistent revenue growth or profitability can be achieved 
the company s ability to achieve revenue growth is dependent upon many factors  including market acceptance of new products and technologies  ability of vendors to supply key components  development of new products in a timely manner  relationships with significant customers and resellers  and capital spending by customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to increase or even maintain its current level of revenues on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
gross margin for the years ended december   and  gross margins as a percentage of sales were  and respectively 
the increase in margin from to was due to the shift in revenues from cameras to pvtv systems which have a higher gross margin per system sale 
this increase was somewhat offset by decreases in margins resulting from the obsolescence of certain parts in connection with discontinuation of the single chip camera system in the decrease in margin from to is due to the decreased revenues from pvtv systems which have a higher gross margin percentage per system sale than the camera sales  an overall decrease in the average selling price of pvtv systems and increased absorption of fixed overhead and indirect labor cost due to lower production volumes 
fluctuations in margin are in part due to changes in the product mix and discounts offered on used systems to reduce the company s inventory of finished products used for demonstrations and tradeshows 
while the company continuously works to improve its gross margin through product pricing  labor efficiencies  reduction of overhead  and product design  there can be no assurance that gross margins will improve significantly over  or remain stable with  the gross margins attained in due to the highly competitive nature of the industry  the introduction of new products  and fluctuations in the cost of component parts 
research and development expenses the company s research and development expenses increased by approximately  or from to  and  or from to research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues were   and in  and  respectively

and leucadia national in in transactions exempt from registration under the securities act of the company s future business plans call for continued investment in research and development and sales and marketing costs related to its video and wireless technologies 
although management may expect to generate revenues in from initial sales of its wireless products  it does not anticipate that the potential revenues together with the video related revenues will be sufficient to offset the expenses from the continued investment in its video and wireless product development and sales and marketing activities
