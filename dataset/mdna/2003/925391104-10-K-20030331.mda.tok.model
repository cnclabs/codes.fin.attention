item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview vesta conducts business in three areas of the personal insurance industry standard property and casualty insurance  non standard automobile insurance  and life insurance 
our consolidated revenue is derived principally from risk bearing premiums  commissions and fees  investment income and investment gains and losses 
our consolidated expenses consist primarily of payments for claims and expenses associated with underwriting activities  agents commissions and operations 
we report financial information according to five business segments standard property casualty insurance  nonstandard agency  nonstandard underwriting  life insurance  and corporate and other 
since  we have discontinued a number of business lines 
we have segregated the reporting for these discontinued operations in our financial statements 
since  we have pursued a strategy to diversify into various segments of the personal insurance markets 
while we have experienced significant and profitable growth in various personal lines business since  we have also experienced significant declines in our property and casualty subsidiaries statutory capital and surplus during the same period 
these declines in capital and surplus are primarily attributable to lower than expected arbitration awards and changes in estimates of disputed reinsurance recoverable balances  reserve strengthening in our discontinued commercial and assumed reinsurance segments and increased policy acquisitions costs associated with significant premium growth 
this decline is statutory surplus coupled with significant growth in premium written is the primary reason that am best company recently adjusted the financial strength ratings of our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries from b very good to b fair 
management is unable to quantify the impact that this adjustment will have on our business  however  this adjustment could lead to significant deterioration in selected portions of our standard property and casualty premium volume and adversely impact the financial results of this segment going forward 
in an effort to strengthen our statutory capital position  we have undertaken an evaluation of a possible sale or divestiture of a portion of our property and casualty business 
standard property casualty and nonstandard underwriting the financial results of our property casualty underwriting activities including our standard property casualty segment and the nonstandard underwriting segment primarily depend upon two variables the amount of premiums we collect  which is dependent upon rates and volume  and the costs we incur to adjust and pay claims submitted by individuals we have insured 
subject to competitive and market trends and regulatory approval  premium rates are generally within our control  and we continuously monitor and seek to adjust rates as appropriate 
during  we implemented rate increases in our standard automobile business line  which represented an average premium increase of approximately 
in  we also implemented rate increases in our standard residential property line  which represented an average premium increase of approximately 
with respect to volume  our ability to increase written premium in our property casualty underwriting activities is largely dependent upon our surplus leverage ratio  which reflects our underwriting operations net written premiums relative to statutory surplus at the end of a period 
as of december   our surplus leverage ratio did not indicate capacity for significant growth in our net premiums written  and  in march of  we commenced an evaluation of a possible sale or divestiture of a portion of our property and casualty business in an effort to maximize shareholder value and strengthen our statutory capital position 
the costs we incur to adjust and pay claims  known as loss and loss adjustment expenses  are largely beyond our control and depend primarily upon the frequency and or severity of claims made by our policyholders 
one measure of performance in the insurance industry is the loss ratio  which is the ratio of i the sum of loss and loss adjustment expenses  to ii the sum of earned premiums and policy fees 
our loss ratio will generally increase or decrease according to the frequency and or severity of claims made by our policyholders 
another key performance measure for insurance companies is the combined ratio 
the combined ratio compares i the sum of loss  loss adjustment expenses  operating expenses and policy acquisition expenses  to ii total earned premiums and policy fees 
a combined ratio of less than indicates underwriting profitability  without regard to investment income earned from investing the premium received 
nonstandard agency the financial results of our agency activities primarily depend upon the amount of fees and commissions we can collect from the sale of insurance products and the expenses we incur to conduct our day to day operations 
although we expect the minimum commissions and policy fees that we earn under a typical agency contract to be relatively stable  we expect to earn a substantial amount of additional profit sharing commissions in excess of the contractual minimums 
these profit sharing commissions are dependent upon whether the nonstandard auto policies that we produce for other insurers result in a level of losses in relation to written premium ie  loss ratios below the levels stated in our agency contracts 
accordingly  the frequency and severity of claims made on the policies our agencies produce may result in changes to estimated revenue 

table of contents life insurance the financial results of our life insurance operations primarily depend upon the amount we collect as premium  the amount of investment income earned on invested premium  and the benefits we pay to insureds upon their death 
unlike the standard property casualty reporting segments  we include the investment income earned on invested premium in the results for our life insurance segment 
the greatest variable in our revenue in the life segment is the amount of income we can earn on invested assets  which is dependent upon general interest rates and market conditions 
the greatest variable in our expense from period to period is the mortality rate of our insureds  as mortality rates in excess of our actuarially predicted levels will adversely impact financial results in any given period 
corporate and other the financial results of our corporate and other segment reflect other revenue and expenses that are not allocated to any particular segment  including i investment income related to our property casualty underwriting operations  ii corporate interest expense  iii general corporate operating expenses  and iv realized gains and losses from the sale of investment securities or the repurchases of our own debt securities at a discount 
in addition to the above mentioned factors  our financial results may also be impacted by weather related events such as hurricanes and tornadoes 
also  our ability to effectively compete in the insurance markets we serve is influenced by the financial strength ratings assigned to our companies by am best 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are based upon the selection and application of accounting policies that require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
our financial results would be directly impacted by changes in assumptions and judgments used to apply our accounting policies  particularly in certain critical areas 
we believe the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
recoverability of assets  including reinsurance receivables  deferred acquisition costs  deferred tax assets and other intangible assets evaluation of goodwill valuation of investments reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses recognition of revenue evaluation of litigation we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and audit committee 
in  we initially adopted three accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
for a discussion of the accounting pronouncements that we have recently adopted  please refer to note a to our consolidated financial statements on page of this report 
recoverability of assets our financial statements include as assets amounts we either i expect to collect from third parties  particularly reinsurance recoverables  or ii expect benefit from in future periods  particularly deferred acquisition costs and deferred tax assets 
in establishing these amounts  we have made significant judgments and estimates regarding the ultimate realization of each asset 
specifically  we have made critical assumptions and judgments in establishing assets for reinsurance recoverables on paid losses  deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred income taxes 
changes in the assumptions  judgments or estimates we have made with respect to each of these assets would directly impact our financial results and financial condition 

table of contents reinsurance recoverable on paid and accrued losses as a matter of practice  we routinely cede risks associated with insurance policies we underwrite to reinsurers pursuant to contractual arrangements 
we obtain reinsurance primarily to provide protection for individual loss occurrences  including catastrophic losses  stabilize the results of our underwriting activities  and reduce our net liability for individual risks 
reinsurance recoverable on paid losses represents management s estimate of the amounts we expect to collect from reinsurers as reimbursement for loss claims we have paid 
in exchange for reinsurance coverage  we pay a portion of the policy premiums we receive to reinsurers who have assumed a specified level of risk pursuant to a reinsurance contract 
although a reinsurer is liable for losses to the extent of coverage to which it assumes  reinsurance arrangements do not legally discharge the principal insurer from primary liability for the full amount of a policy 
when we determine that a claim for loss made under one of our policies is owed  we initially pay the full amount owed to the claimant 
subsequently  we seek to recover any amounts due from reinsurers in accordance with the terms of the applicable reinsurance contract 
we record the amounts we expect to receive from reinsurers pursuant to these contracts as assets in our financial statements 
at december   we had recorded million as amounts recoverable from reinsurers on losses we had paid for valid claims 
the amounts recorded have been estimated based upon management s interpretation of each reinsurer s obligations pursuant to individual reinsurance contracts between vesta and each reinsurer 
in establishing the balance for reinsurance recoverable  we have made judgments in assessing the financial viability and credit quality of each reinsurer as well as the ability of each reinsurer to pay amounts owed to us 
in evaluating the credit and financial quality of each reinsurer  we rely upon our management s experience and industry knowledge  as well as financial statements  credit reports and other publicly available information applicable to each reinsurer 
it is possible that the amounts we recover under reinsurance contracts could be materially less than the amounts we have recorded  which may result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
some reinsurers may dispute our claims under reinsurance contracts  including our calculation of amounts recoverable 
changes in our assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to establishing assets for reinsurance recoverables on paid losses would materially impact our financial results and financial condition 
for more discussion of reinsurance recoverables and other amounts subject to estimation due to arbitrations with our reinsurers  please refer to notes g and i to our financial statements on pages and  respectively  of this report 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs represent costs we incur in connection with acquiring new business or renewing existing business 
deferred policy acquisition costs are primarily comprised of commissions  underwriting and agency expenses and other costs related to issuing insurance policies 
in accordance with gaap  these costs are not expensed in their entirety upon their incurrence as is the case for statutory accounting purposes  rather  they are initially recorded as assets in our financial statements and are subsequently amortized over the life of the insurance policies to which they relate or at a constant rate based upon the present value of the estimated gross profits to be earned from the underlying policies 
this treatment is intended to match the expenses associated with issuing an insurance policy with estimated profits to be earned on the policy over the life of the policy 
at december   we had established million as assets for deferred acquisition costs in our financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews the components of deferred acquisition costs we have established and assesses their recoverability 
changes in our assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to establishing deferred acquisition costs including any change in our estimated future loss ratios  could materially impact our financial statements and financial condition 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
at december   we had established net deferred tax assets of million  which reflects the amount of future benefit we expect to realize in the form of income tax refunds or reductions in income taxes paid 
our deferred tax asset is primarily comprised of net operating loss carryforwards that may be used to offset future taxable income and  thereby  reduce income tax payments 
the deferred tax assets have been established in accordance with gaap and based upon the applicable tax rates and tax laws 

table of contents in order to record deferred tax assets  gaap requires management to justify that realization of the asset is more likely than not 
a valuation allowance against deferred taxes is recorded if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
valuation allowances are based upon estimates of taxable income and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recovered 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or these estimates are adjusted in future periods  we may need to establish a valuation allowance  which would impact our financial position and results of operations 
to date  no such valuation allowance has been established  as we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is determined based upon management s assumptions and judgments as to our future financial performance 
with respect to future financial performance  we have projected that we will generate earnings sufficient to utilize  prior to their respective expiration periods  all net operating losses that comprise deferred tax assets 
there can be no assurance that our actual financial results in the future will not vary materially from the estimates we have used in our assessment of the recoverability of deferred taxes 
material differences between expected results and actual performance would adversely impact our financial results and financial condition 
in addition  there can be no assurance that there will not be changes in the accounting rules or tax laws regarding treatment of deferred tax assets 
goodwill in our financial statements  we have recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which represents the amount by which the price we paid to acquire net assets exceeds the fair value of tangible assets acquired plus the liabilities assumed 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon management s short and long term projections of future performance for each of our business lines 
certain of these forecasts reflect assumptions regarding our ability to sustain or increase activities in our various business lines 
changes in strategy and or market conditions may result in changes to recorded asset balances 
effective january   in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill on a periodic basis in our financial statements 
rather  on at least an annual basis  we conduct an evaluation to assess whether the fair value of our reporting units exceeds each reporting units carrying value 
we evaluate impairment of three reporting units homeowners insurance operations  life insurance companies  and non standard agency operations 
for purposes of applying the provisions of sfas no 
 we compare the aggregate fair value and carrying value of each reporting unit to determine if there is any impairment 
as long as the aggregate fair value exceeds the aggregate carrying value for each reporting unit  no impairment is recognized in our financial statements  even if an individual component of a reporting unit would be impaired on a stand alone basis 
for the year ended december   we have recorded goodwill and other intangible assets for each reporting unit as follows homeowners insurance operations million  life insurance companies million  and nonstandard auto insurance operations million 
in connection with our evaluation of goodwill  we engaged a third party regularly involved in the valuation of insurance companies to perform a valuation analysis of our reporting units 
based upon a the historical financial performance of each unit  b the most recent financial performance of each unit  c management s financial forecast for each reporting unit  d information regarding publicly available financial terms of recent transactions in the insurance industry  e current and historical market prices of the common stock of comparable companies in the insurance industry  and f other publicly available information  management concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill with respect to any of our reporting units 
in the fourth quarter of  we wrote off million of goodwill associated with our discontinued health insurance and consulting business lines 
with respect to our reporting units in continuing operations  we have concluded that there is no goodwill impairment as of december  with respect to all of our reporting units  our ability to achieve forecasts and projected undiscounted cash flows are based upon a continuation of current financial strength ratings by am best 
also  because of uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and business lines  it is possible that forecasts used to support goodwill may change in the future  which could result in additional non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
valuation of investments in accordance with guidelines established by our board of directors  our investment portfolio consists primarily of investment grade  fixed income securities 
at december   our cash and investment portfolio was approximately billion  with only consisting of investments in equity securities 
because of the nature of our investments  the fair value of our portfolio is not typically volatile  and the market values of our investments have generally been greater than or equal to their costs 
our investments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted prices  if available 
if quoted prices are not available  fair value is primarily determined based upon management s assessment of the market value of comparable investments 
our determination of fair value also considers various factors including time value and volatility issues  credit quality of the counterparty and existing conditions in the overall financial markets 
from time to time  the carrying values of our investments may be temporarily impaired because of such factors 
we do not adjust the carrying value of any investment unless management determines that its value is other than temporarily impaired 
management conducts regular reviews to assess whether the values of our investments are impaired and if any impairment is other than temporary 
if we determine that the value of any investment is other than temporarily impaired  we record a charge against earnings in the amount of the impairment 
the determination of whether other than temporary impairment has occurred involves significant assumptions  estimates and judgments by management 
changing economic conditions global  regional or related to industries of specific issuers could adversely affect these values loss and loss adjustment expenses we maintain property casualty loss reserves to cover the estimated ultimate unpaid liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of the ultimate liability  but rather utilize actuarial projection techniques commonly used in the insurance industry to develop estimates 
reserve estimates represent managements expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based upon an assessment of facts and circumstances then known  a review of historical settlement 
table of contents patterns  estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency  estimates of salvage and subrogation  and other factors 
for purposes of establishing reserves on risks insured during the most recent year  including interim periods for which there is minimum experience to date  we have used forecasted loss ratios that have been applied to earned premiums during the interim periods 
the determination of such forecasted loss ratios involved significant judgments by management  taking into account the results of the most recent actuarial studies performed  current pricing and underwriting  expected loss and loss adjustment expense trends and other pertinent considerations 
in addition  we monitored and analyzed key loss and loss adjustment expense indicators and trends throughout the year 
these included  but were not limited to  paid losses  newly reported claims and incidents  closed claim activity and other metrics 
at december   we had recorded liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses of million 
our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves comprise the largest liability and most significant estimate or compilation of estimates in our financial statements 
furthermore  our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are subject to significant inherent uncertainties and so there can be no assurance as to whether the actual results will be higher or lower than these estimates 
any adjustments or changes for such differences may be material  especially to our operating results for a period 
as our loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are re estimated  changes to those estimates  if any  are recognized through a charge to income in the most recent period presented 
revenue recognition our consolidated revenue is derived principally from premiums  commissions  fees  investment income and investment gains and losses 
premium income  the largest component of our revenue is generally recognized on a pro rata basis over the respective period of each property casualty insurance policy 
premium receivables are recorded net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
agency commission income is recognized at the later of the billing or effective date of the related insurance policies  net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations 
at that date  the earnings process has been completed and we can reliably estimate the impact of policy cancellations for refunds and establish reserves accordingly 
premiums on life insurance contracts are recognized as income as they become due 
generally  we consider commission and policy fees earned by our agency activities to be a relatively stable revenue stream 
however  a significant portion of our non standard agency business utilizes profit sharing  or contingent  commissions that enable us to collect  in certain circumstances  commissions and fees in excess of contractual minimums and we record estimates of these profit sharing commissions when they become probable 
the collection of these additional profit sharing commissions is dependent upon whether the non standard auto policies that we produce for other insurers result in a loss ratio below the levels stated in our agency contracts 
accordingly  the frequency and severity of claims made on the policies our agencies produce may result in changes to estimated revenue 
changes in assumptions  estimates and judgments we have made concerning the ultimate realization of profit sharing commissions  as well as differences in the frequency and severity of claims by policyholders  would adversely impact our financial results and financial condition 
litigation we are subject to proceedings  arbitrations  lawsuits and other claims  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  labor  insurance contracts and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based upon a careful analysis of each individual issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
we have not established any amounts for reserves for litigation or arbitration risks in our financial statements 
our judgments as to any reserves required in connection with these matters may change in the future because of new developments in each situation or changes in our approach in addressing these matters such as a change in settlement strategy 
for more information concerning litigation and arbitration matters to which we are a party  please refer to item legal proceedings beginning on page of this report and note g to our financial statements on page of this report 
comparison of to for the year ended december   we reported a net loss available to common shareholders of million 
diluted per share  compared with a net loss available to shareholders of million 
diluted per share reported for the previous year 

table of contents the primary factors that impacted our financial results in were as follows the writedown of million of non performing collateral loans held as investments in our life insurance segment  the recognition of charges of million related to arbitration matters with usf g and nrma insurance  ltd  the recognition of a pre tax charge of million related to our decision to exit the health insurance business  including million to recognize goodwill impairment on the health insurance business line  settlement of employment contracts with former management resulting in a pre tax charge of million  reduction in investment income as a result of an overall decline in interest rates significant growth in our standard property casualty business line in texas  significant growth in our non standard agency and non standard underwriting business lines as a result of the acquisitions of insureone january  american agencies january  a affordable insurance november and spacecoast underwriters october  and settlement of our claim against cincinnati insurance company  pursuant to which we received million of cash before expenses 
for a depiction of the various components of revenue  expense and financial results for each of our business segments for the years ending december  please refer to note l of our financial statements on page included in this report 
standard property casualty segment in our standard property casualty segment  we underwrite or sell personal automobile and residential property insurance through approximately  independent insurance sales agencies 
in  the standard property casualty segment generated approximately million in revenue  or approximately of consolidated revenue 
for the year ended december   net premiums written in our standard property casualty lines increased by million up  to million from million in the prior year 
net premiums earned for standard property casualty lines increased by million in  up  to million from million in the increase in both net premiums written and net premiums earned was primarily attributable to increased writings in texas of million compared with million in the prior year 
the growth in premiums was partially offset by decreased writings in the midwest and mid atlantic regions in connection with our decision to terminate agents and withdraw from certain states 
effective december   we ceded of the premiums and losses on our texas residential property business to third party reinsurers pursuant to a quota share reinsurance contract 
as a result  we expect our total standard property casualty net written premiums will decrease in although we expect our net written premium will decrease in on a net basis  we have implemented rate increases to address emerging loss trends and to protect our net written premium relative to expenses  or underwriting margin 
during  we implemented rate increases in our standard automobile business line  which represented an average premium increase of approximately 
in  we also implemented rate increases in our standard residential property line  which represented an average increase of approximately 
loss and loss adjustment expenses for standard property casualty lines for the year ended december  increased by million up to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred was primarily attributable to our growth in business in texas 
loss and loss adjustment expenses in texas were million in  compared with million in the prior year 
for the year ended december   the loss ratio for standard property casualty segment was compared with at december  the increase in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to deteriorating results in the first half of in pennsylvania  west virginia and certain other states that deteriorated because of increased severity and frequency 
the loss ratio for these states  and the entire segment  returned to more normal levels in the second half of for the year ended december   policy acquisition expenses increased by million up to million from million for the same period of the prior year 
in  policy acquisition expenses related to our activities in texas increased to million from 
million in operating expenses increased by million  or  to million from million  primarily as a result of our growth in texas 
non standard agency segment our non standard agency segment does not engage in underwriting activities 
rather  the primary focus of our agency segment is the distribution of non standard auto insurance products for various insurance carriers in exchange for commissions and fees 
since our entry into the non standard auto business in late  revenue for our agency segment has 
table of contents increased significantly 
in  our non standard agency segment generated approximately million of commission and fees based revenue  or approximately of consolidated revenue 
for the year ended december   fees and commissions in our agency segment increased by million from the prior year as a result of the acquisitions of insureone and american agencies in january and a affordable and spacecoast underwriters  in november and october  respectively 
as a result of these acquisitions  our agency segment improved its financial performance in  achieving pre tax income from continuing operations of approximately million compared with a pre tax operating loss of million in non standard underwriting segment our non standard underwriting segment can be separated into two lines of business underwriting non standard auto insurance products sold by our affiliated agency operations and underwriting non standard auto insurance sold by unaffiliated agencies 
in each of these business lines  we utilize quota share reinsurance to minimize our exposure to loss 
under a quota share contract  reinsurers share losses and certain allocated expenses in the same percentage as they share in premiums 
since entering the non standard auto business in late  our revenue has increased significantly 
in  our non standard underwriting segment generated approximately million of revenue  representing approximately of consolidated revenue 
for the year ended december   net premiums written for non standard lines increased by million  to million from million in for the same period  net premiums earned for non standard lines increased by million to million from million 
the increase in net premiums written and net premiums earned was primarily attributable to new business produced by our affiliated agency operations  which acquired several agencies in late and early of our total non standard net written premiums of million during  the net premiums written on policies sold by our affiliated agencies was approximately million 
the largest component of our net premiums written on policies sold by affiliated agencies was approximately million net premium written through insureone  our affiliated agency operation based in chicago  illinois 
until december   we bore of the underwriting risk on these policies 
effective december   we ceded of the premiums and losses on the insure one business to third party reinsurers pursuant to a quota share reinsurance contract 
as a result  we expect our total non standard underwriting net written premiums will decrease in of our total net written premiums of million during  net written premiums produced by unaffiliated agencies was approximately million  with approximately million of gross written premium ceded to third party reinsurers 
for the year ended december   we also collected issuing carrier or fronting fees of approximately million  up from million in the increase in fronting fees was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of ceded earned premium fronted for a program in california to million in  compared with million in although we expect our net written premium will decrease in on an absolute basis as a result of the quota share reinsurance contract placed on the insure one business  we have implemented rate increases to address emerging loss trends and to protect our underwriting margin 
during  we implemented rate increases in our non standard underwriting segment  which represented an average premium increase of approximately 
loss and loss adjustment expenses for the non standard underwriting segment increased by million in  to million from million in the increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred was primarily attributable to the increase in earned premium produced by affiliated agencies acquired in our agency segment during the loss ratio for our non standard underwriting segment at december  was  compared with at december  the decrease in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio was primarily attributable to favorable loss ratios on premium produced by affiliated agencies acquired in our agency segment during consistent with the corresponding increase in earned premium  policy acquisition expenses for the year ended december  increased by million from the same period of the prior year 
in  we paid a slightly higher commission rate of compared with in the prior year because of increased contingent  or profit sharing  commissions earned on improved underwriting results 

table of contents life insurance segment we provided a variety of life insurance products through our holdings in american founders financial corporation  a holding company for two life insurance companies domiciled in texas 
american founders business is driven primarily by the acquisitions of closed blocks of life insurance policies and  to a lesser extent  by marketing and distributing its fixed annuity products 
our life insurance products are sold through marketing firms  financial institutions and independent agents located throughout states and the district of columbia 
at december   american founders had approximately billion face value of life and annuity products in force  and approximately million in invested assets 
in  our life insurance segment generated approximately million in revenue  or of consolidated revenue  excluding realized gains and losses 
realized losses in consist primarily of a write off of approximately million of collateral loans see discussion below 
life insurance premiums and policy fees increased to million from million in the prior year as a result of the inclusion of a full year results for acquisitions of imperial general  teton national and washington life made in partially offset by normal declines on closed block and increased reinsurance 
investment income decreased from the prior year because of an overall decline in market interest rates during in addition  investment income declined by approximately million in because we did not accrue interest on approximately million of non performing loans held as investments in our life insurance segment 
as described below  these loans were written off in the fourth quarter of during  we actively pursued collection of approximately million in loans held as assets by american founders  including the filing of civil lawsuits seeking to collect these loans and cooperation with the mexican attorney general in a criminal investigation related to the conduct of some of the individuals responsible for these loans 
we believed that these collection efforts would yield in a short time period positive indications that the individuals responsible for repaying these loans would acknowledge their obligations and voluntarily perform 
as of december   we had seen no indications that these individuals would do so  and we expect to engage in protracted civil litigation regarding this matter 
accordingly  we concluded that these loans were impaired and recorded an estimated loss on these loans equal to their entire balance 
this write off reduced american founders statutory surplus significantly 
in an effort to restore american founders surplus to an acceptable level  we increased a third party reinsurer s coinsurance participation in substantially all of american founders business from to  effective october  at december   american founders had statutory capital of million compared with million at december  while this increased reinsurance positively impacted american founders statutory capital at year end  it negatively impacted financial results for the fourth quarter  as the decline in policyholders benefits was more than offset by the decline in premium and investment income 
the effect of this increased cession of premiums  investment income and policyholder benefits will affect the financial results for the complete year in  and we expect income from our existing business in this segment to decrease slightly in corporate and other segment for the year ended december   net investment income related to our property casualty underwriting operations decreased by million to million from million in the weighted average yield on invested assets for excluding realized and unrealized gains was  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in investment income was primarily attributable to a decline in overall market interest rates 
our overall interest expense includes interest payable on our senior debentures due in  interest on certain federal home loan bank borrowings and our commercial credit borrowings 
although we repurchased approximately million face amount of our long term debentures and capital securities during  overall interest expense decreased only slightly compared with  as the interest savings arising from the repurchases of these securities was substantially offset by higher average commercial credit borrowings and higher borrowing from the federal home loan bank 
in  operating expenses increased by million from the prior year primarily because of a severance payment to our former chairman of approximately million in connection with his voluntary resignation in december  as part of that severance  the former chairman forfeited  shares of restricted stock and repaid million of loans plus accrued interest 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to exit the health insurance and consulting business lines 
accordingly  our health insurance and consulting lines results for have been reclassified in our financial statements as part of discontinued operations and are classified as operations held for sale 
for the year ended december   we recorded a 
table of contents pre tax loss of million for our health operations and million for our consulting business 
these results include write downs in the fourth quarter of million and million  representing the previously recorded goodwill for the health insurance and consulting lines  respectively 
previously  in and  we exited the reinsurance assumed and commercial lines businesses  respectively 
as a result  the reporting for these business lines is included in discontinued operations in our financial statements 
at the time we made the decision to exit each of these business lines  we estimated the reserves required to fulfill our expected future obligations with respect to these discontinued operations 
however  we continue to monitor our recorded estimates with respect to ultimate settlement on an ongoing basis 
during  we experienced an unexpected increase in the severity and volume of reported claims associated with both our discontinued assumed reinsurance and commercial lines and increased payments on claim reserves 
additionally  in the nd quarter of  we received an award of million from our arbitration with f g re related to two loss ratio contracts covering accident years and in our financial statements  we recorded a charge of million to reflect the difference between our recorded recoverable of million and the award amount 
the charge was recorded in our assumed reinsurance segment which is included in discontinued operations  consistent with the manner in which premiums and losses were originally recorded 
as a result of these items  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in our financial statements for the year ended december  with respect to the discontinued assumed reinsurance line  we increased reserves because of negative trend development relating primarily to certain homeowner coverages 
we believe these types of claims should fully develop over a relatively short period of time 
with respect to the discontinued commercial lines  the increase in expected losses related primarily to our participation in mandatory pools 
these types of claims may take many years to fully develop and we must continue to monitor trends in their ultimate developments 
based upon available information  we believe the recorded reserves for discontinued operations at december  is adequate 
however  we will continue to monitor these reserves and their related claims activity and experience 
further adjustments to our estimates could be necessary as we continue to run off the remaining outstanding claims 
income taxes for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million  compared with an income tax benefit of million recorded in the prior year 
our effective tax rate of in was consistent with our effective tax rate in the prior year 
comparison of to for the year ended december   we reported a net loss available to common shareholders of million 
diluted per share  a decrease of million from net income available to shareholders of million 
diluted per share reported for the previous year ended december  the decrease in income available to common shareholders in was primarily attributable to an additional charge of million to after tax discontinued operations in the current year  and recording an after tax charge of million relating to settlement of a securities class action lawsuit 
standard property casualty segment for the year ended december   net premiums written in our standard property casualty lines increased by million up  to million from million in the prior year 
net premiums earned for standard property casualty lines increased by million in  up  to million from million in the increase in both net premiums written and net premiums earned was primarily attributable to additional business resulting from our acquisition of florida select insurance holdings  inc on april  loss and loss adjustment expenses for standard property casualty lines for the year ended december  increased by million up to million from million in the prior year 
the loss ratio for property casualty lines at december  was  compared with at december  the increase in loss and loss adjusted expenses incurred was primarily attributable to corresponding increases in earned premium

we exited these lines through non renewal of policies  and we remain obligated to settle claims relating to coverages provided prior to the expiration and non renewal of individual policies 
effective with our decision to exit these lines  we have reported the financial results for these business lines in discontinued operations 
at the time we made the decision to exit these business lines  we estimated the reserves required to fulfill our expected future obligations with respect to these discontinued operations 
on an ongoing basis  we monitor these estimates with respect to ultimate settlement 
during  we experienced an unexpected increase in the severity and volume of reported claims associated with both our discontinued assumed reinsurance and commercial lines and increased payments on claim reserves 
as a result  we recorded an after tax charge of million in our financial statements for the year ended december  to increase the reserves in order to revise our estimated reserves to reflect expected losses from these discontinued lines 
with respect to the discontinued assumed reinsurance line  we increased reserves because of negative trend development relating primarily to certain homeowner coverages 
we believe these types of claims should fully develop over a relatively short period of time 
with respect to the discontinued commercial lines  the increase in expected losses related to a variety of underlying coverages  including general liability 
these types of claims may take many years to fully develop and we must continue to monitor trends in their ultimate developments

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources holding company vesta is a holding company whose principal asset is its investment in the capital stock of the companies constituting the vesta insurance group 
the principal uses of funds at the holding company level are to pay operating expenses  principal and interest on outstanding indebtedness and deferrable capital securities  and dividends to stockholders as declared by the board of directors 
vesta s principal source of liquidity and capital resources to meet its holding company obligations is dividends paid by our subsidiaries 
many of our subsidiaries are insurance companies that are individually supervised by various state insurance regulators  and other unregulated companies that we own  such as instant insurance holdings  inc  are owned indirectly through a regulated insurance company 
given our organizational structure  we rely on two subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company or otherwise fund the obligations of our holding company on its behalf vesta fire insurance corporation  an illinois domiciled insurer  and j 
gordon gaines  inc  a delaware business corporation 
dividends from vesta fire transactions between vesta and its insurance subsidiaries  including the payment of dividends  are subject to certain limitations under the insurance laws of those subsidiaries domiciliary states 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois  where vesta fire is domiciled  permit the payment of dividends out of unassigned surplus in any year which  together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding months  do not exceed the greater of of statutory surplus as of the end of the preceding year or the net income for the preceding year  with larger dividends payable only after receipt of prior regulatory approval 
the illinois insurance department has indicated that these dividend limitations prohibit the payment of dividends if the insurer has negative or zero unassigned funds at the end of the prior year  as reported on its 
table of contents statutorily required annual statement 
our lead insurance subsidiary  vesta fire  reported negative unassigned funds on its annual statement for  and is expected to continue to report negative unassigned funds for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we may not be able to declare and pay a dividend from our lead insurance company subsidiary for the foreseeable future without prior approval 
there can be no assurance that vesta fire will be able to obtain the requisite regulatory approval for the payment of dividends 
dividends from j 
gordon gaines j 
gordon gaines  inc provides administrative services to all of our property casualty insurance subsidiaries in exchange for fees pursuant to an administrative services agreement and  with respect to our texas select lloyds insurance company  an attorney in fact agreement 
these management agreements are subject to certain regulatory standards which generally require their terms and fees to be fair and reasonable 
the illinois or texas departments of insurance may review these agreements from time to time to insure the reasonableness of their terms and fees  and it is possible that such terms and fees could be modified to reduce the amounts available to our holding company 
assuming these management agreements are not modified in a material respect  we believe that j 
gordon gaines  inc will be able to pay dividends to our holding company  or otherwise fund the obligations of our holding company on its behalf  sufficient to fund our anticipated needs including debt service for at least the next twelve months
