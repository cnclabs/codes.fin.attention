enterprise catalog management services were offered up until january  see services operations sale in the following paragraph 
the company continues to report in one operating segment and does not allocate expenses to these product groups 
the company s management assesses operating results on an aggregate basis to make decisions about the allocation of resources 
on january   the company sold the industrial data normalization services operations and recorded a gain of thousand recorded as other income 
under the terms of the sale  the company retained comprehensive  non exclusive rights to the software and technology used in the business  which has been embedded in the company s maximo and online commerce services offerings 
also  due to the sale of this business  the company will no longer sell enterprise catalog management services

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial conditions and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that page management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies  in which different judgments and estimates by our management could materially affect our reported condition and results of operations  include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  deferred tax assets  and the valuation of long lived assets 
revenue recognition software products the company licenses its software products under noncancellable license agreements 
software license fee revenues are generally recognized upon contract execution and product shipment  provided that collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable  the fees are fixed or determinable  and no significant modification or customization of the software is required 
our customers do not have any right of return except as stipulated under a standard day warranty that runs concurrent with post contract product support pcs 
the company does not maintain any reserves with respect to this warranty based on a history of performance of our software 
on the rare occasion that a customer insists on conditions of acceptance  the company defers revenue until the customer s acceptance is obtained and the condition has been satisfied 
revenue from products sold through indirect channels resellers is recognized upon shipment of the software  as long as evidence of an arrangement exists  collectibility is probable and the fee is fixed or determinable and the reseller s obligation to pay us is not contingent upon resale of our product 
revenue is recorded net of any commissions or discounts 
our resellers do not have any right of return beyond the standard day performance warranty that runs concurrent with post contract product support pcs 
services revenues services revenues are comprised of consulting and training fees related to installation of the company s software solutions  maintenance support pcs contracts for software products  content management and subscription based fees related to the company s online commerce services ocs business 
consulting  training and content management services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
pcs revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement  generally one year 
customers typically subscribe to ocs on an annual basis and revenue is recorded as services revenue and recognized on a straight line basis over the applicable subscription period 
many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting contracts 
we consider whether the services revenue can be recognized separately from the software revenue by analyzing the nature of the services ie if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  the level of risk  availability of services from other vendors  acceptance criteria  milestone payments and fixed price terms 
for those contracts that contain fixed price arrangements  if we can reliably estimate the hours required to complete the implementation services and if we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe for the fair value of the hourly rates for consultants  we recognize the software license fee separately from the services revenues 
the services revenues are recognized as they are delivered and the related costs as they are incurred 
for those fixed price arrangements where we cannot reliably estimate the hours required to complete the implementation services and we do not have vsoe for the fair value of the hourly rates for consultants  the software license value is recognized together with the consulting services over the period the consulting services are provided 
multiple element arrangements the company s multiple element arrangements could include the following three elements a software license  b pcs  and c consulting  training and other services services 
revenue is allocated to the elements of the arrangement based upon the vsoe of fair value of each page element 
the company uses the residual method to recognize its software license revenue  because while we are able to determine the vsoe of fair value of pcs and services  we are unable to determine the fair value of software licenses 
under the residual method  the fair value of undelivered elements pcs and or services is deferred and recognized when the pcs and or services are delivered 
the difference between the amount of the total arrangement and the amount attributable to the elements for which fair value is determinable pcs and or services is recognized as software license revenue 
vsoe is established for pcs and is based on the price of pcs when sold separately 
the pcs renewal rate is a relatively consistent percentage of the stipulated software license fee  offered to all customers 
vsoe for consulting services is based on fixed hourly rates set according to the skill level of the consultant required 
vsoe for training services is based on an established per student fee structure 
for those multi element arrangements  where we cannot establish vsoe for the undelivered elements  the software license value is recognized together with the consulting services over the period the consulting services are provided 
contract accounting is applied to any arrangement that includes significant customization or modification of the software 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net days 
payment terms that extend beyond net days from the contract date but are within twelve months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful history of collecting on such arrangements 
for those customers who are deemed not to be credit worthy  revenue is deferred until payment is received 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts  which reflect the company s estimate of the amounts owed by customers that customers will be unable or otherwise fail to pay 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of customer accounts and factors such as historical experience  credit quality  age of the accounts receivable balance  and current economic conditions 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and limits the amount of credit when deemed necessary 
the company believes that the current estimate of allowances for doubtful accounts recorded as of september  adequately covers any potential credit risks 
however  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates and their payment defaults exceed our estimates  then we may need to increase our allowance reserves  which will result in a charge to income in the period that the adjustment is made 
the company did not record a provision for estimated sales returns 
based on our history of sales returns and an analysis of credit memos  we determined that a provision was not needed 
if the historical data we used to calculate the basis for a provision does not properly reflect future returns  then a provision for returns will be recorded  and a charge to income will result  in the period that such a determination is made 
deferred income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability approach for accounting and reporting for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board no 
the company computes deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  the expected tax benefit of operating loss carryforwards and the expected benefit of tax credit carryforwards 
changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded in the provision for income taxes 
the company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax asset 
the deferred tax asset may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in the determination of recording a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies when assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
negative evidence that would suggest the need for a valuation allowance page for the company consists of our recent cumulative operating losses  which were attributable to unprofitable internet commerce businesses that we were engaged in 
we have since ceased operation of these unprofitable businesses and we believe that we have substantial positive evidence that would negate the need for a valuation allowance 
the positive evidence consists of the current year cumulative pre tax profits and projected future pre tax profits  as well as  a consistent earnings history for the company prior to these operating loss years 
the company believes future taxable income will be sufficient to realize the deferred tax benefit of the net deferred tax assets 
in the event that it is determined that our financial projections change and it becomes more likely than not that we cannot realize the net deferred tax assets  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets will be made and will result in a charge to income in the period such a determination is made 
the net deferred tax asset amount as of september  is million 
the company has established a valuation allowance with respect to the net operating losses acquired from applied image technology  inc million  various state net operating loss carryforwards thousand  and certain canadian net operating loss carryforwards thousand 
the valuation allowance was based upon expected earnings within individual tax jurisdictions and statutory limitations imposed by tax jurisdictions  which will more likely than not reduce our ability to realize the net operating loss carryforwards 
the reduction in the net valuation allowance in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the company reviews its long lived assets  with the exception of goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may exceed their fair value 
the company estimates whether future cash flows expected to result from the use of assets exceed the carrying amount of the assets 
in the event that the company judges that an impairment exists  all or a portion of the asset will be written off based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in order to determine the fair value  the company obtains quoted market prices or utilizes valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows 
the company also periodically assesses the useful life of its fixed assets and may in the future need to adjust the life of an asset or write it off 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment or whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the net tangible and intangible assets in a reporting unit exceeds the reporting units fair value  a detailed impairment loss analysis would be performed to calculate the amount of impairment  if any

factors affecting future performance the nature of forward looking information is that such information involves significant assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
certain public documents of the company and statements made by our authorized officers  directors  employees  agents and representatives  acting on behalf of the company  may include forward looking information  which will be influenced by the factors described below  and by other assumptions  risks and uncertainties 
forward looking information is based on assumptions  estimates  forecasts and projections regarding the company s future results as well as the future effectiveness of the company s strategic plans and future operational decisions 
forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company are subject to the risk that the forecasts  projections  and expectations of management  or assumptions underlying such forecasts  projections and expectations  may prove to be inaccurate 
accordingly  actual results and the company s implementation of its plans and operations may differ materially from forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
the following discussion identifies certain important factors that could affect the company s actual results and actions and could cause such results and actions to differ materially from forward looking statements 
our business is sensitive to general economic conditions  and overall downturns in the economy and in industrial spending  and our forecasting systems have never been tested under conditions of extended economic downturn 
over the past several quarters  the us and worldwide economies have experienced difficult conditions  with a negative effect on our revenues and operations 
as industrial companies experience downturns  they often delay or cease spending on capital assets and it infrastructure including software and related services 
as a result  our revenues have in the past fallen  and may again in the future fall  below expectations 
the slump in the economy in general  and the market for it software and services in particular  have continued for an extended period of time 
while our forecasting systems and metrics have generally been reliable in informing our projections and guidance for future performance  the current economic downturn page has persisted for a length of time that is unprecedented in the company s recent history  our forecasting systems may not be valid under such conditions  and they might not be valid during a period of economic recovery 
as a result  our expectations and guidance for future performance may not be accurate 
if the us and worldwide economies do not recover and if growth in it spending does not materialize  our revenues may be decreased  and there could be a material and adverse result on our operating results and financial condition 
the traditional market for our maximo product is mature and saturated and presents limited opportunity for growth 
maximo has been the industry leading plant floor capital asset maintenance product for a number of years  and we have acquired a large number of customers in this market 
however  most large industrial organizations have made significant investments in systems that support the maintenance of their capital assets  and opportunities for new maximo sales in the enterprise asset management market are more limited than they have been in the past 
in addition  the emergence and growth of this market have attracted a large number of competitors  and most of the largest software companies that sell into complementary markets have developed competing asset maintenance products 
it is likely that this market will continue to mature  there will be fewer sales opportunities for the company  and competitive forces will put downward pressure on our average sales prices and rates of success 
while we continue to strengthen our maximo offering  these efforts may not be sufficient to overcome the effects of maturity and saturation in our traditional market  and our revenues  margins  results of operation and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 
our efforts to reach into new markets with maximo and with new products may not be successful 
given the maturity and saturation of our traditional enterprise asset management market  in order to maintain revenues at their current levels and to grow our business  we are attempting to broaden our product offerings and find additional sources of revenues  in two ways 
first  we are tailoring and extending maximo to meet the needs of specific industries in which the company has a presence  such as the nuclear  transportation  power transmission and distribution  and other industries 
we refer to these industry specific maximo offerings as industry solutions 
second  we are attempting  through the maincontrol acquisition and additional internal development  to deliver products that address markets that are new to the company  such as the it asset management and consolidated service desk markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market our industry solutions or new products on time  with acceptable quality and with such functions and features that meet the requirements of customers in these markets 
if our industry solutions and newly acquired or developed products do not gain market acceptance and generate revenues from new industries or markets  we may not be able to grow our business or maintain revenues at current levels  and our revenues  margins  results of operation and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted 
if we are unable to keep pace with the rapid changes in technology and customer demand that characterize our industry  our competitive position could be impaired 
the computer software industry is characterized by rapid technological advances  changes in customer requirements and frequent product introductions and enhancements by us and by our competitors 
our success depends on our abilities to enhance our current products  to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  to respond to evolving customer requirements and changing industry standards  to offer functionality and other innovations that are unique to our products and superior to those of our competitors  and ultimately to achieve market acceptance 
in particular  we believe that we must continue to innovate and develop new functionality to respond quickly to users needs for new functionality and to advances in hardware and operating systems  and that we must continue to create products that conform to industry standards regarding the communication and interoperability among software  hardware and communications products of different vendors 
if we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and changes in market definitions or changes in customer requirements within particular market segments  or if we have any significant delays in product development or introduction  then we could lose competitiveness and revenues 
we cannot give any assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products or product enhancements  or that we will not experience significant delays in our development efforts 
in addition  we cannot give any assurance that our new products and product enhancements will page achieve market acceptance 
finally  when we develop new products  or enhancements to our existing products  it is possible that potential customers will defer or delay their decisions to purchase existing products while the newer products and enhancements are being developed  released and proven in the market 
such delays could have a material and adverse impact on ongoing sales of existing products  and on the company s business and our results of operations 
we depend substantially on our maximo product  and any developments that cause reduced market acceptance of maximo would harm our business 
most of our revenues are derived from the licensing of our maximo family of products and sales of related services and support 
our financial performance depends largely on continued market acceptance of maximo  and on the acceptance and market penetration of maximo  our new internet centric version of maximo 
we believe that continued market acceptance of maximo  and our revenue stability and growth  will largely depend on our ability to continue to enhance and broaden the capabilities of maximo  both by broadening the core maximo functionality and by developing specialized functionality targeted at key customer industries 
new internet technologies  standards  applications  functions and features are developing rapidly and are continuously being introduced  competing for acceptance in the market  and changing  and we must accurately anticipate technology and market trends and make the right choices in order to keep maximo at the forefront in its market from a technological perspective 
any factor adversely affecting sales of maximo  such as delays in further development  significant software flaws  incompatibility with significant hardware platforms  operating systems or databases  increased competition  poor technology decisions or negative evaluations of the product  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and our results of operations 
in addition  in the event that our development efforts are not progressing as intended  or if our new product releases or technologies are not successful in the markets they are intended to address  we may increase our rate of expenditure in this area over and above the level of investment experienced in the past or previously projected  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 
the market addressed by our maximo maincontrol product is in turmoil  and a significant new competitor may emerge 
our maximo maincontrol product is targeted at the it asset maintenance itam market 
in the past  peregrine systems  inc had the biggest single share of this market 
peregrine filed for bankruptcy protection in september as a result of peregrine s bankruptcy  this market has become fragmented  and some market analysts and prospective maximo maincontrol customers have questioned the validity of the product category  and adopted a wait and see attitude towards purchasing products in this market 
peregrine s plan of reorganization was recently confirmed  and as a result peregrine may successfully emerge from bankruptcy 
it remains to be seen whether peregrine s reorganization has enabled peregrine to streamline its operations and restructure its pre bankruptcy liabilities in a manner that will render it as a stronger competitor in the itam market  and there can be no assurance that this market will coalesce and gain momentum  or that the company will achieve its desired market share 
our sales efforts depend in part on strategic relationships with other companies 
we have entered into strategic relationships with various larger companies  such as ibm corporation  deloitte consulting lp  rockwell automation  lp kearney  inc  booz allen hamilton  saic  and others 
in order to generate revenue through these relationships  we must integrate our products and solutions with those of the other companies 
each party to those strategic relationships must coordinate with and support each other s sales and marketing efforts  and each party must make significant sales and marketing investments 
our ability to generate revenues through these relationships depends in large part upon the efforts of these other companies  which are outside of our control 
the efforts of these companies may in turn be influenced by factors internal to these companies  or by developments in their respective industries or markets  that we fail to anticipate 
we have in the past successfully engaged in cooperative software sales efforts with peoplesoft  inc  a vendor of an enterprise resource planning erp system that does not compete with our products  and with which maximo is successfully integrated 
peoplesoft recently acquired jd edwards co  which markets a page product that competes with maximo 
as a result  it is highly likely that peoplesoft will cease to act in cooperation with the company  as it markets its new jd edwards product and our software sales may decline as a result 
in addition  we have agreed to develop a version of maximo  which will operate with ibm s websphere  aix and db products  and to market the ibm versions of our products in preference to other versions 
maximo sales will therefore be affected by the success and acceptance of the ibm websphere  aix and db products relative to those of ibm s competitors 
we may experience difficulties in gaining market acceptance of the ibm version of our products  and difficulties in integrating and coordinating our products and sales efforts with those of ibm 
finally  our alliance with ibm may be viewed negatively by customers or prospects that have not adopted the ibm technology platform  and competitive alliances may emerge among other companies that are more attractive to our customers and prospective customers 
our quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations and to seasonal variation 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  significant period to period fluctuations in revenues and operating results  which may negatively impact the price of our stock 
in addition  our quarterly revenues and operating results have fluctuated historically due to the number and timing of product introductions and enhancements  customers delaying their purchasing decisions in anticipation of new product releases  the budgeting and purchasing cycles of customers  the timing of product shipments and the timing of marketing and product development expenditures 
we typically realize a significant portion of our revenue from sales of software licenses in the last two weeks of each quarter  frequently even in the last few days of a quarter 
failure to close a small number of large software license contracts may have a significant impact on revenues for the quarter and could  therefore  result in significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results  and divergence of those results from our expectations 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
we face challenges with the maincontrol acquisition  and we may not be successful in addressing a new and broader market 
we recently acquired maincontrol  inc  which developed a product that enables companies to manage  track and maintain their information technology it assets  such as computers  telephones and networks 
one of the assumptions underlying our acquisition of maincontrol was that our existing customers might be interested in purchasing our new it product 
with the acquisition of maincontrol  our positioning with existing and prospective customers has changed in that we are now offering products which can manage more of a company s critical physical assets  such as it assets  in addition to those managed by maximo  such as plant floor assets  vehicles and facilities 
however  in many cases the people who purchased maximo may not have responsibility for management of their company s it assets 
if we are unable to obtain access to executive levels in our customers and prospective customers organizations  we will be unable to sell a solution that covers more than just the plant floor assets  the vehicle fleet  the facilities or the it assets 
moreover  it is possible that our attempts to characterize this combination of target markets as a single or composite market will not be accepted within the industry  by market analysts or by our customers  and as a result we might not gain the cross market sales opportunities and synergies that we hoped for in the maincontrol acquisition 
finally  we have announced our intention to integrate the maximo maincontrol product into our maximo platform  utilizing the same leading edge internet centric architecture and technologies as contained in maximo  in order to provide a common platform from which a customer s critical assets may be managed 
it is also possible that prospective customers may prefer to wait until this integrated solution is available before purchasing maximo maincontrol  and it is possible that during the interim period while the integrated version is under development such customers may decide to purchase a competing product  in either case revenues from maximo maincontrol would be deferred  or lost entirely  and there could be a material and adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
page acquisitions may fail to meet our expectations 
we may from time to time purchase other companies or their products or technologies 
while we exercise due diligence in determining the nature of the assets and liabilities of such acquired companies and whether their products or technologies are suitable and of commercial quality  there can be no assurances that we will not acquire unanticipated or undisclosed liabilities or that operations from and after the date of acquisition can be predicted from prior performance or will meet our expectations 
there can also be no assurances that acquired products or technologies will be of commercial quality or meet our expectations  that we will be able to employ and retain the personnel necessary for us to achieve continuity in the acquired business and effectively exploit the new products or technologies  that we will be able to successfully integrate the new products or technologies with or into our existing products and product architecture  that we will be able to effectively distribute the new products or technologies through our existing sales force and channels  that we will be able to retain existing customers and revenue streams that may have been associated with the new products or technologies prior to their acquisition by us  or that such existing customers may not demand that we remedy problems that were not known or disclosed to us at the time of the acquisition 
as a result of the foregoing  we may not realize the benefits intended from such acquisitions or recover our investments  which would have a material adverse impact on our business and our results of operations 
we face intense competition in the markets we serve 
the markets for strategic asset maintenance software such as maximo and maximo maincontrol are fragmented by geography  by market and industry segments  by hardware platform and by industry orientation  and are characterized by a large number of competitors including both independent software vendors and certain enterprise resource planning erp vendors 
independent software vendors include datastream systems  inc and indus international  inc 
maximo also competes with integrated erp systems  which include integrated maintenance modules offered by several large vendors  such as sap  oracle  jd edwards recently acquired by peoplesoft and others 
maximo maincontrol competes with companies in it asset management market  such as peregrine systems and computer associates 
currently  maximo competes with products of a number of large vendors  some of which have traditionally provided maintenance software operating in a client server environment and our now developing or offering systems that are web architected 
maximo also encounters competition from vendors of low cost maintenance management systems designed initially for use by a single user or limited number of users as vendors of these products upgrade their functionality and performance to enter the enterprise market 
certain of our competitors have greater financial  marketing  service and support and technological resources than we do 
to the extent that such competitors increase their focus on the asset maintenance or planning and cost systems markets  or on the industrial supply chain market  we could be at a competitive disadvantage 
our international operations subject us to special risks 
a significant portion of our total revenues and expenses are derived and incurred from operations outside the united states 
our ability to sell our products internationally is subject to a number of risks 
general economic and political conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
exposure to currency fluctuations and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable could affect our sales 
we could be affected by the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign import laws  united states export laws and regulatory requirements 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market and increase our operating costs 
our software products are dependent on third party providers of software and services  and failure of these parties to perform as expected  or termination of our relationships with them  could harm our business 
we have entered into nonexclusive license agreements with other software vendors  pursuant to which we incorporate into our products and solutions software providing certain application development  hardware and network discovery  user interface  business intelligence  content and graphics capabilities developed by these page companies 
we have also agreed to bundle ibm s websphere application server  its aix operating system and db database programs with maximo 
if we cannot renew these licenses at all or on commercially reasonable terms  or if any of such vendors were to become unable to support and enhance their products  we could be required to devote additional resources to the enhancement and support of these products or to acquire or develop software providing equivalent capabilities  which could cause delays in the development and introduction of products incorporating such capabilities 
we may have exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
the amount of taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we file 
periodically  we are subject to income tax audits 
while we believe that we have complied with all applicable tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law and assess us with additional taxes 
should we be assessed with additional taxes  there could be a material and adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
changes in regulations or critical accounting policies could materially and adversely affect us 
new laws  regulations or standards related to us or our products  and new accounting pronouncements  could be implemented or changed in a manner that could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may be forced to perform more fixed price services contracts 
a trend is emerging among customers in our market towards demanding consulting and implementation services on a fixed price basis  whereby the company agrees to deliver the contract requirements for a fixed fee  regardless of the number of person hours actually provided  as opposed to our traditional services arrangements where we deliver services on a time and materials basis 
in addition  when our industry solutions are first delivered  they may not include all of the functionality required by the initial customers  and we may complete the development effort under a services contract with the customer 
in cases where services are provided either for the future delivery of functionality or on a fixed price basis and our standard software is licensed at the same time  and if the services are essential to the overall solution desired by the customer or if the company cannot determine the fair value of the services being delivered  then the company may not be able to recognize the software license revenue from such transactions at the time the agreements are signed  but rather may be required to recognize such license revenue under the contract or other method of accounting  or to recognize a greater portion or or all of the revenue from these transactions as services revenue 
this would likely result in a postponement of recognition of  or a reduction in  software license revenues  and have an adverse impact on the results of our operations 
we may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property 
our success is dependent upon our proprietary technology 
we currently have two united states patents and other corresponding patents or applications pending in various foreign countries  and we protect our technology primarily through copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and employee and third party nondisclosure agreements 
our software products are sometimes licensed to customers under shrink wrap or click wrap licenses included as part of the product packaging or acknowledged by customers who register on line 
although  in larger sales  our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses may be accompanied by specifically negotiated agreements signed by the licensee  in many cases our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees 
certain provisions of our shrink wrap and click wrap licenses  including provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of the licensed program  and limitations or liabilities and exclusions of remedies  may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
finally  we sell our products through distributors and resellers  and are therefore dependent on those companies to take appropriate steps to adequately implement our contractual protections  and to enforce and protect our rights 
we cannot give any assurance that the steps that we have taken to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or development by others of similar technology 
although we believe that our products and technology do not infringe on any valid page claim of any patent or any other proprietary rights of others  we cannot give any assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  could result in the deterioration or outright loss of our patent rights  copyrights or other intellectual property  and could potentially have a material adverse result on our operating results and financial condition 
loss of the services of one or more of our key executive officers or inability to recruit needed sales  services and technical personnel could adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent on certain key executive officers  technical and sales employees  and the loss of one or more of such employees could have an adverse impact on our future operations 
we do not have employment contracts with any personnel  and we do not maintain any so called key person life insurance policies on any personnel 
we continue to hire a significant number of additional sales  services and technical personnel 
competition for hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense  and from time to time we may experience difficulty in locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications within the desired geographic locations  or with certain industry specific expertise 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract additional qualified employees 
our stock price has been volatile  and you could incur losses as a result of future fluctuations in our stock price 
there have been significant fluctuations in the market price of our common stock  recently and over longer time periods 
in addition  the stock market in general has recently experienced substantial price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many software and technology companies and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market fluctuations also may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  general macroeconomic and market conditions unrelated to our performance may also affect demand for our products and services  our results of operations  and our stock price 
other risks the foregoing is not a complete description of all risks relevant to our future performance  and the foregoing should be read and understood together with and in the context of similar discussions which may be contained in the documents that we file with the sec in the future 
we undertake no obligation to release publicly any revision to the foregoing or any update to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary exposures to market risk are the effect of fluctuations in interest rates earned on its cash equivalents and marketable securities and exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
at september   the company held million in cash equivalents and marketable securities consisting of taxable and tax exempt municipal securities 
cash equivalents are classified as available for sale and valued at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity 
the company develops its products in the united states and markets them in north america  europe  middle east and africa  australia  asia pacific and latin america 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
currently  the company has no hedging contracts
