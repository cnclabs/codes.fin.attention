item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
net revenues total consolidated net revenues gross revenues less cost of sales for the twelve months ended december  were  million  a million decrease compared with the decrease in revenues was primarily attributable to reduced off system sales  incentive programs and non weather related gas sales totaling million  lower prices related to increased sales of natural gas production to satisfy requirements under forward sales agreements amounting to million  issued credits totaling million pertaining to the indiana utility regulatory commission iurc electric rate review settlement  million from scaling back the energy trading operations and an million reduction in gains on the sales of storage base gas 
slightly offsetting the decrease was a million impact of favorable weather due to a much colder fall heating season  which increased natural gas sales and deliveries  and a warmer summer cooling season that positively impacted electric sales 
net revenues for of  million increased  million over the increase  primarily attributable to the inclusion of twelve months of columbia operations in compared to two months in  was reduced by approximately million from record setting warmer than normal weather during the heating season 
expenses operating expenses were  million in  a million decrease from a portion of the decrease was attributable to a million reduction in operation and maintenance expenses primarily due to lower employee related  support services and facilities expenses of million resulting from reorganization initiatives  insurance recoveries of environmental expenses totaling million  a reversal of million in reserves for estimated taxes and environmental expenditures  reduced dry well and geological expenses of million  and a reduction of million from reduced uncollectible customer accounts and other customer related expenses 
the period was unfavorably impacted by the million litigation settlement related to market hub partners  lp mhp 
also contributing to the decrease was the elimination of million of goodwill amortization as a result of a financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard that affected goodwill amortization beginning january  and million primarily from gains on the sales of nisource s utility line locating and marking business and a significant portion of tpc s gas trading contracts 
for  employee related expenses were increased by higher pension and post retirement benefits expense resulting from a decrease of basis points in the discount rate used to value the liabilities 
pension expense was further impacted by a flat return on plan assets in versus the expected return 
due to poor performance in world equity markets during  and resulting negative returns on plan assets  pension expense is expected to increase million over the level 
operating expenses of  million for increased  million over the increase was primarily attributable to including twelve months of columbia operations in compared to two months in in addition  was negatively impacted by restructuring costs of million  uncollectibles of million related to the enron bankruptcy  an increase in other uncollectible customer accounts of million and a one time charge of million related to the settlement of the mhp litigation

the change in the effective tax rate in versus the previous year was due to discontinuing the amortization of goodwill in see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
discontinued operations discontinued operations reflected an after tax loss of million  or a loss of cents per share  in compared to an after tax loss of million  or loss of cents per share  in and income of million  or cents per share  in the results were unfavorably impacted by a non cash charge of million  after tax  that was recognized as a result of the continuing depressed market for dark fiber and nisource s decision to exit the telecommunications business 
the loss in the period was primarily related to the results of transcom s operations  including an impairment charge of million  after tax 
the period primarily reflects the operations of the water utilities 
liquidity and capital resources generally  cash flow from operations has provided sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements 
a significant portion of nisource s operations  most notably in the gas distribution  gas transportation and electric businesses  are subject to seasonal fluctuations in cash flow 
during the heating season  which is primarily from november through march  cash receipts from gas sales and transportation services typically exceed cash requirements 
in the summer months  cash receipts from electric sales normally exceed cash requirements 
also  during the summer months  cash on hand  together with external short term and long term financing  is used in operations to purchase gas to place in storage for heating season deliveries  perform necessary maintenance of facilities  make capital improvements in plant and expand service into new areas 
net cash from operations for the twelve months ended december  was  million 
cash generated from working capital was million  principally driven by reductions in inventories and gas receivables  partly offset by payments for current liabilities and the timing of the recovery of gas and fuel costs

nisource plans to refinance approximately billion of expiring long term debt during with additional proceeds from asset sales and new debt issuances by its financing subsidiary nisource finance 
credit facilities during march  nisource finance negotiated a million day credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  led by barclays capital  which expires on march  this facility replaced the expiring billion day credit facility and complements nisource s existing billion three year facility that expires on march  nisource will not renew the day facility  which expires on march  in addition  the billion three year facility that expires on march  is being amended to allow for the aggregate letters of credit outstanding under this agreement to be increased from million to million 
the reduction in nisource s short term borrowing needs is attributable to the sales iwcr  sm p and the exploration and production joint venture  the proceeds from the november equity offering  and positive operating cash flows

credit ratings during january  standard and poor s reaffirmed nisource s bbb senior unsecured long term credit rating and its a commercial paper rating with a negative outlook 
on february   moody s investor service moody s downgraded the senior unsecured long term debt ratings of nisource and nisource finance to baa and the commercial paper rating of nisource finance to p with a negative outlook 
in addition  moody s downgraded the long term debt ratings of all other rated nisource subsidiaries to baa to align the ratings of the subsidiaries and bring them closer to nisource s ratings going forward 
on february   fitch ratings reaffirmed nisource s bbb senior unsecured long term credit rating and its f commercial paper rating  but revised nisource s ratings outlook from stable to negative 
on november   nisource completed an equity offering  realizing million in net proceeds  which were used for the repayment of debt 
the equity offering significantly improved nisource s financial position by reducing its debt leverage ratios 
in addition  nisource expects to further reduce leverage by using the proceeds from the recent sale of its natural gas exploration and production joint venture in new york to reduce outstanding debt 
while the rating agencies stated that they have welcomed nisource s recent actions to reduce financial leverage  additional balance sheet improvement measures may be necessary to either secure a ratings upgrade or to improve the current ratings outlook 
tpc has entered into electric trading agreements that contain ratings triggers that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of nisource or certain of its subsidiaries fall below bbb at standard and poor s or baa at moody s 
the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately million to million 
in addition to agreements with ratings triggers  there are other agreements that contain adequate assurance or material adverse change provisions 
the collateral requirement for those agreements would amount to approximately million to million 
in the case of nisource s primary energy subsidiaries  ratings triggers would result in increases in the financing rates used to calculate operating lease payments for four of the projects 
one other primary energy project would require the issuance of a letter of credit in the event of a ratings downgrade to ba by moody s or bb by standard and poor s 
the letter of credit required in the event of a downgrade would have a face amount of million to million depending on the extent of the downgrade 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
columbia is the principal for surety bonds issued to guarantee performance under forward gas sales agreements 
the surety bonds related to forward gas sales under agreements with mahonia ii limited have indemnity values amounting to approximately million declining over time and have ratings triggers if the credit rating of columbia falls below bbb at standard and poor s or baa at moody s 
columbia s long term debt ratings are currently bbb and baa at standard and poor s and moody s  respectively 
the collateral requirement from a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would require the posting of a letter of credit of approximately million declining over time 
in another  but unrelated transaction  the surety  in accordance with the terms of its indemnity agreement  required nisource to post a letter of credit in the face amount of approximately million  declining over time  to support the bonds

capital expenditures the table below reflects actual capital expenditures by segment for and and an estimate for year in millions e gas distribution transmission storage electric exploration production other total for  capital expenditures were million  a decrease of million over the gas distribution segment s capital program in included new business initiatives to extend service to new areas and develop future markets through new services that may be added to the existing business and to create a potential new pool of customers  as well as expenditures to ensure safe  reliable and improved service to customers and modernize and upgrade facilities 
the transmission and storage segment invested million in primarily on modernizing and upgrading facilities and new business initiatives to maintain and expand market share in storage and transportation interstate commerce by meeting the demands of consumers who will use gas for electric power generation and meeting the needs of existing  new or growing customers through the construction of significant new facilities  either wholly owned by nisource or in partnership with other qualified project participants 
the electric capital program included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation  transmission and distribution assets  expenditures related to environmental compliance regarding nitrogen oxide nox reduction  and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business 
companies within the other segment invested million in energy technologies 
for  the projected capital program is expected to be million  which is million higher than the level 
this higher spending is mainly due to increased expenditures for nox compliance  a portion of which will be recovered through the northern indiana environmental tracker 
the program is expected to be funded primarily via cash from operations 
pension funding due to lower than expected returns on plan assets over the past three years and a lower assumed discount rate  nisource s pension plans are currently in an underfunded position 
although nisource expects market returns to revert to normal levels as demonstrated in historical periods  nisource may be required to provide additional funding for the obligations if returns on plan assets fall short of the assumed long term rate 
also  nisource expects pension expense for to increase million over the amount recognized in see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
market risk sensitive instruments and positions risk is an inherent part of nisource s energy businesses and activities 
the extent to which nisource properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its businesses is critical to its profitability 
nisource seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal risks involved in nisource s energy businesses commodity market risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
risk management at nisource is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication  judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
nisource s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business  nisource s risk management policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
through its various business activities  nisource is exposed to both non trading business and trading risks 
the non trading risks to which nisource is exposed include interest rate risk  commodity market risk and credit risk of its subsidiaries 
the risk resulting from trading activities consists primarily of commodity market and credit risks 
nisource s risk management policy permits the use of certain financial instruments to manage its market risk  including futures  forwards  options and swaps 
risk management at nisource is defined as the process by which the organization ensures that the risks to which it is exposed are the risks to which it desires to be exposed to achieve its primary business objectives 
nisource employs various analytic techniques to measure and monitor its market and credit risks  including value at risk var and instrument sensitivity to market factors 
var represents the potential loss or gain for an instrument or portfolio from changes in market factors  for a specified time period and at a specified confidence level 
non trading risks commodity price risk resulting from non trading activities at nisource s rate regulated subsidiaries is limited  since current regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power  fuel and gas costs through the rate making process 
as the utility industry undergoes deregulation  these operations may be providing services without the benefit of the traditional ratemaking process and will be more exposed to commodity price risk 
effective july   tpc sold a significant portion of its net obligations under its gas forward transaction portfolio  physical storage inventory and associated agreements to a third party 
prior to the sale  tpc s operations included the activities of its gas and power trading businesses 
beginning with the effective date of the sale  the primary remaining operations associated with tpc include commercial and industrial gas sales including arranging supply  power marketing and gas supply associated with nisource s single merchant cogeneration facility  marketing a portion of the gas produced from nisource s exploration and production operations  and power trading 
with the exception of power trading and one remaining gas trading deal  which expired in october  since july  the gas related activities at tpc are no longer considered trading activities for accounting purposes 
nisource is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under revolving credit agreements and lines of credit  which have interest rates that are indexed to short term market interest rates  and refinancing risk in the commercial paper markets 
at december   the combined borrowings outstanding under these facilities totaled million 
nisource is also exposed to interest rate risk due to changes in interest rates on fixed to variable interest rate swaps that hedge the fair value of a portion of columbia s long term debt 
on september   columbia entered into new receive fixed and pay floating interest rate swap agreements totaling million with three counterparties effective as of september  according to the agreements  nisource will receive payments based upon a fixed interest rate and will pay a floating interest amount based on us month libor bba plus per annum 
in total  columbia has entered into fixed to variable interest rate swaps on million of its long term debt 
based upon average borrowings under agreements subject to fluctuations in short term market interest rates during and  an increase in short term interest rates of basis points would have increased interest expense by million and million for the years and  respectively 
nisource s primary energy subsidiary had engaged in interest rate swaps to fix the floating payment related to a portion of a lease payment that floated with a referenced interest rate  and designated these instruments as cash flow hedges 
the swaps expired june  and subsequently  upon lease termination at december   primary energy purchased the previously leased facilities 
due to the nature of the industry  credit risk is a factor in many of nisource s business activities 
credit risk arises because of the possibility that a customer  supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date 
for derivative contracts such as interest rate swaps  credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to pay nisource the positive fair value or receivable resulting from the execution of contract terms 
exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current and potential exposure 
current credit exposure is generally measured by the notional or principal value of financial instruments and direct credit substitutes  such as commitments  standby letters of credit and guarantees 
because many of nisource s exposures vary with changes in market prices  nisource also estimates the potential credit exposure over the remaining term of transactions through statistical analyses of market prices 
in determining exposure  nisource considers collateral and master netting agreements  which are used to reduce individual counterparty credit risk 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
trading risks prior to the july  sale of the tpc gas marketing and trading contracts  nisource s trading operations consisted of gas and power related activities 
beginning july  with the exception of one remaining gas trading deal  which expired in october  the trading activities of tpc have involved power only 
the transactions associated with nisource s power trading operations give rise to various risks  including market risks resulting from the potential loss from adverse changes in the market prices of electricity 
the power trading operations market and trade over the counter contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity 
those contracts within the power trading portfolio that require settlement by physical delivery are often net settled in accordance with industry standards 
fair value represents the amount at which willing parties would transact an arms length transaction 
fair value is determined by applying a current price to the associated contract volume for a commodity 
the current price is derived from one of three sources including actively quoted markets such as the new york mercantile exchange nymex  commodity exchanges and over the counter markets including brokers and dealers  or financial models such as the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair values of the contracts related to nisource s trading operations  the activity affecting the changes in the fair values during  the sources of the valuations of the contracts during and the years in which the remaining contracts all power trading mature are in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period including net option premiums received fair value of new contracts entered into during the period other changes in fair values during the period fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the period in millions after prices actively quoted prices from other external sources prices based on models other method total fair values contracts reported within the caption prices actively quoted include futures and options traded on the nymex 
the caption prices from other external sources generally includes contracts traded on commodity exchanges and over the counter contracts whose value is based on published indices or other publicly available pricing information 
contracts shown within prices based on models other method are valued employing the widely used black scholes option pricing model 
market risk measurement market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  volatilities  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a specified position or portfolio 
nisource estimates the one day var across the marketing and trading groups that utilize derivatives using variance covariance at a confidence level 
based on the results of the var analysis  the daily market exposure for power trading on an average  high and low basis was million  million and effectively zero  during  respectively 
the daily var for the gas marketing and trading portfolios on an average  high and low basis was million  million and million during  respectively 
prospectively  management has set the var limits at million for gas related activities and million for power trading 
exceeding the var limits would result in management actions to reduce portfolio risk 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
accounting change effective january   nisource adopted the fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
collectively referred to as sfas no 

these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain conditions are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment  or b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january   resulted in a cumulative after tax increase to net income of approximately million and an after tax reduction to other comprehensive income oci of approximately million  which was recognized in earnings during and the adoption also resulted in the recognition of million of assets and million of liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  the adoption resulted in the reduction of hedged risk basis of million and the reclassification of deferred revenue to oci of million 
equity forward share purchase agreement in  nisource entered into an equity forward share purchase agreement that qualified as permanent equity for accounting purposes 
the terms of the agreement were designed to serve as an economic hedge for the shares that would be issued pursuant to equity forward share sales agreements that were a part of the corporate pies 
as the purchase agreement represented a forward purchase of equity shares  nisource had committed to a price for the acquisition of a prescribed number of shares at a future date 
nisource terminated the agreement at the end of with a final settlement date in early due to the termination  nisource recorded the fair value of the agreement as an asset of million  with a corresponding increase to stockholders equity as of december  during the first quarter of  through the settlement date  nisource recognized million in earnings associated with marking the agreement to fair value 
refer to critical accounting policies of this item  and risk management activities in notes and  respectively  of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of nisource s risk management 
other information critical accounting policies nisource applies certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had  and may continue to have  significant impacts on nisource s results of operations and consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates  if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
nisource s rate regulated subsidiaries follow the accounting and reporting requirements of sfas no 
certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
the total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets were million and million at december   and million and million at december   respectively 
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for nisource to recover its costs in the future  all or a portion of nisource s regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas no 
in such event  a write down of all or a portion of nisource s existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result 
if transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under generally accepted accounting principles for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period  the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts 
if unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 nisource would be required to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
in management s opinion  nisource s regulated subsidiaries will be subject to sfas no 
for the foreseeable future 
certain of the regulatory assets reflected on nisource s consolidated balance sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates 
although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed  nisource believes that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets under sfas no 
regulatory assets requiring specific regulatory action amounted to million at december  if nisource determined that the amounts included as regulatory assets were not recoverable  a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
hedging activities 
under sfas no 
 the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation 
unrealized and realized gains and losses are recognized each period as components of other comprehensive income  regulatory assets and liabilities or earnings depending on the nature of such derivatives 
for subsidiaries that utilize derivatives for cash flow hedges  the effective portions of the gains and losses are recorded to other comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings concurrent with the disposition of the hedged risks 
for fair value hedges  the gains and losses are recorded in earnings each period along with the change in the fair value of the hedged item 
as a result of the rate making process  the rate regulated subsidiaries generally record gains and losses as regulatory liabilities or assets and recognize such gains or losses in earnings when recovered in revenues 
in order for a derivative contract to be designated as a hedge  the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item or transaction must be highly effective 
the effectiveness test is performed at the inception of the hedge and each reporting period thereafter  throughout the period that the hedge is designated 
any amounts determined to be ineffective are recorded currently in earnings 
although nisource applies some judgment in the assessment of hedge effectiveness to designate certain derivatives as hedges  the nature of the contracts used to hedge the underlying risks is such that the correlation of the changes in fair values of the derivatives and underlying risks is high 
nisource generally uses nymex exchange traded natural gas futures and options contracts and over the counter swaps based on published indices to hedge the risks underlying its natural gas related businesses 
nisource had million of price risk management assets and million of price risk management liabilities primarily related to cash flow hedges at december  the amount of unrealized gains recorded to other comprehensive income was million at december  accounting for energy trading activities 
energy trading activities refers to energy contracts entered into with the objective of generating profits on or from exposure to shifts or changes in market prices 
nisource evaluates the contracts of its trading operations in accordance with the criteria for derivative contracts under sfas no 
through  contracts not meeting the criteria under sfas no 
were recorded at fair value under emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for energy trading and risk management activities eitf no 

pursuant to eitf no 
 when certain trading criteria are met  energy contracts  including energy related contracts such as tolling  transportation and storage contracts  should be accounted for at fair value marked to market along with any related derivative contracts  recognizing related gains and losses currently in earnings 
during an october  eitf meeting  eitf no 
was rescinded effective immediately for contracts entered into after that date and after december  for existing trading contracts 
while the assessment of fair values for nisource s trading contracts have been mainly based on pricing information for exchange traded contracts  transportation and storage agreements related to gas trading deals entered into prior to the cessation of gas trading activities were marked to fair value based on the results of internal models 
no estimates of fair values on transportation and storage contracts related to gas trading activities remained as of december  due to the sale or expiration of all gas trading related agreements during the year 
in addition  power trading options were marked to fair value through earnings based on internal calculations of fair value employing the widely used black scholes option pricing model 
at december   the fair value of the mark to fair value options outstanding was a loss of million 
at december  and  nisource reflected million and million of price risk management assets and million and million of price risk management liabilities related to unrealized gains and losses on trading activities  respectively 
pensions and postretirement benefits 
nisource has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits 
the plans are accounted for under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value  long term returns on plan assets and employee longevity  amongst other assumptions 
due to the size of the plans and the long term nature of the associated liabilities  changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition 
for further discussion of nisource s pensions and other postretirement benefits see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

this upward trend is driven by the overall poor underwriting experience of the insurance industry over the past few years  in conjunction with the overall downturn of the capital markets and the economy  which drives the need for underwriters to seek higher premiums and further restrict coverage

gas distribution operations continued competition gas distribution competes with investor owned  municipal  and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service area  and to a lesser extent with other regulated natural gas utilities and propane and fuel oil suppliers 
gas distribution continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas 
competition with providers of electricity is generally strongest in the residential and commercial markets of kentucky  southern ohio  southwestern pennsylvania and western virginia where electric rates are primarily driven by low cost  coal fired generation 
gas competes with fuel oil and propane in the new england markets mainly due to the installed base of fuel oil and propane based heating which  over time  has comprised a dwindling percentage of the overall market 
restructuring during  nisource carried out a new reorganization initiative  which resulted in the elimination of approximately positions throughout all nisource segments mainly affecting executive and other management level employees 
gas distribution accrued approximately million of salaries  benefits and facilities costs associated with the reorganization initiative 
the charge included million related to the consolidation of facilities affecting leased office space in richmond  virginia and mount lebanon  pennsylvania 
additionally  during  the restructuring accrual was decreased by million related to previous reorganization initiatives 
regulatory matters changes in gas industry regulation  which began in the mid s at the federal level  has broadened to retail customers at the state level 
large industrial and commercial customers have had the ability to purchase natural gas directly from marketers and to use gas distribution s facilities for transportation services for many years 
this opportunity to choose an alternative supplier has been migrating into the small commercial and residential customer classes with approved or pilot transportation programs being used in of the states served by gas distribution 
as of december   approximately million of gas distribution s residential and commercial customers had selected an alternate supplier 
gas distribution continues to explore customer choice opportunities through regulatory initiatives in all of its jurisdictions 
while these programs are intended to provide all customer classes with the opportunity to obtain gas supplies from alternative merchants  gas distribution expects to play a substantial role in supplying gas commodity services to its customers in the foreseeable future 
as customers enroll in these programs and purchase their gas from other suppliers  the gas distribution subsidiaries are sometimes left with pipeline capacity they have contracted for  but no longer need 
the state commissions in jurisdictions served by gas distribution are at various stages in addressing these issues and other transition considerations 
gas distribution is currently recovering  or has the opportunity to recover  the costs resulting from the unbundling of its services and believes that most of such future costs will be mitigated or recovered 
methodologies for mitigating or recovering transition costs include incentive sharing mechanisms  reducing levels of reserved pipeline capacity and mandatory assignment of pipeline capacity to alternative suppliers 
in december  the public utilities commission of ohio puco approved a request from columbia gas of ohio that extends columbia of ohio s customer choice sm program through october   freezes base rates through october  and resolves the issue of transition costs from pipeline capacity 
under the agreement  columbia of ohio assumes total financial risk for mitigation of transition capacity costs at no additional cost to customers 
columbia of ohio has the opportunity to utilize non traditional revenue sources as a means of offsetting the costs 
on november   the puco issued final rules to implement the provisions of choice legislation enacted by the ohio general assembly on march  the rules have been approved by a joint committee on agency rule review of the ohio legislature  and were effective on july  the new rules establish the process for puco certification and regulation of competitive retail natural gas suppliers  establish minimum service standards for competitive natural gas suppliers  and specify the procedures for establishment of governmental aggregation programs  in which consumers have the right to opt out of the program 
columbia of ohio filed tariffs incorporating the rules on november  a number of communities in the service territory of columbia of ohio have passed aggregation initiatives in recent elections 
there are approximately million eligible customers item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
gas distribution operations continued in these communities 
two communities began governmental aggregation in late and it is anticipated that other communities will begin the governmental aggregations in as part of the kentucky public service commission kpsc order approving the acquisition of columbia  columbia gas of kentucky  inc columbia gas of kentucky was required to file a rate case that included an estimate of net merger savings and a mechanism to reflect merger savings on customers bills 
on may   columbia gas of kentucky filed a general rate case  requesting an increase in revenue of approximately million or of annual operating revenues including the net merger savings 
on september   columbia gas of kentucky and all other parties of record in this proceeding filed a settlement with the kpsc 
the settlement was approved by the kpsc on december  the settlement reduces columbia gas of kentucky s base rates by million  with million of the reduction recovered through a tracking mechanism to cover the costs of a program to support low income customers 
the changes become effective in march in november  northern utilities new hampshire nunh filed a general rate case requesting an increase in revenue of approximately million or of annual operating revenues 
in february  nunh received approval of interim rates  designed to generate an additional million in revenues annually  to be applied to gas consumed on and after february  in september  nunh and all parties in this proceeding filed a settlement with the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc that will increase rates by approximately million 
on october  the nhpuc issued an order approving the settlement  with new permanent rates effective as of november  nunh will refund to customers approximately million which is the difference between the revenue collected from the interim increase  generated from temporary rates  reduced by the approved rate case expenses and the lower revenues based on the permanent rates for the period from february to november the net amount will be refunded to customers over the month period from november through october on august   the iurc approved a flexible gas cost adjustment mechanism for northern indiana 
under the new procedure  the demand component of the adjustment factor will be determined  after hearings and iurc approval  and made effective on november of each year 
the demand component will remain in effect for one year until a new demand component is approved by the iurc 
the commodity component of the adjustment factor will be determined by monthly filings  which will become effective on the first day of each calendar month  subject to refund 
the monthly filings do not require iurc approval but will be reviewed by the iurc during the annual hearing that will take place regarding the demand component filing 
northern indiana s gas cost adjustment factor also includes a gas cost incentive mechanism which allows the sharing of any cost savings or cost increases with customers based on a comparison of actual gas supply portfolio cost to a market based benchmark price 
northern indiana made its annual filing on august  the iurc approved implementation of interim rates  subject to refund  effective november  another party has filed testimony indicating that some gas costs should not be recovered 
a hearing is scheduled for march  management intends to vigorously oppose any efforts to reduce the recovery of gas costs 
ferc order the ferc issued order on february  the order sets forth revisions to the previous regulatory framework to improve the competitiveness and the efficiency of the interstate natural gas transportation market 
it effects changes in regulations relating to scheduling procedures  pipeline penalties  pricing transparency  new pipeline service offerings  capacity release capabilities  new reporting requirements and various other service related issues intended to enhance competition in the industry 
since the order was issued  pipelines have made pro forma filings to comply 
gas distribution has actively engaged in settlement discussions with all of its pipeline suppliers as well as with other major customers on those pipeline systems in an effort to resolve pertinent issues 
to date  only a few of gas distribution s pipeline suppliers have been able to reach an agreement with customers and implement ferc approved settlements 
most of the major pipeline suppliers to gas distribution made revised pro forma compliance filings  which have been approved by ferc  but have not been implemented because of pending requests for rehearing 
also  as a result of a legal challenge to order no 
 the dc circuit court of appeals reversed and remanded to ferc some aspects of order no 
 but did not upset order no 
generally or require broad changes to how pipelines implement the rule 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
gas distribution operations continued based upon orders from ferc on some pipelines compliance filings and the slowed progress by ferc  gas distribution believes that full implementation of order will not generally begin to take place prior to the winter of additionally  based upon gas distribution s experience to date and ferc s guidance regarding the effect of order no 
on various aspects of pipeline operations  as well as the degree of compromise that occurred from all segments of the industry  management believes that while full implementation of order no 
will result in some additional competition for gas distribution with regard to gas supply cost management and competition from market entrants that do not have supplier of last resort obligations  it will not have a material effect upon gas distribution costs  operations  or income 
environmental matters remediation 
several gas distribution subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties prps at waste disposal sites under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act cercla commonly known as superfund and similar state laws  including at former manufactured gas plant mgp sites which such subsidiaries  or their corporate predecessors  own or previously owned or operated 
gas distribution subsidiaries may be required to share in the cost of clean up of such sites 
in addition  some gas distribution subsidiaries have corrective action liability under the resource conservation and recovery act rcra for closure and clean up costs associated with underground storage tanks and under the toxic substances control act for clean up of polychlorinated biphenyls released at various facilities 
gas distribution subsidiaries are parties to or otherwise involved in clean up of three waste disposal sites under superfund or similar state laws 
for one of these sites the potential liability is de minimis and  for the other two  the final costs of clean up have not yet been determined 
as site investigations and clean ups proceed and as additional information becomes available  the waste disposal site liability is reviewed and adjusted  as necessary 
a program has been instituted to identify and investigate former mgp sites where gas distribution subsidiaries or predecessors are the current or former owner 
the program has identified such sites 
initial investigation has been conducted at sites 
of these sites  additional investigation activities have been completed or are in progress at sites and remedial measures have been implemented or completed at sites 
only those site investigation  characterization and remediation costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under sfas no

as costs become probable and reasonably estimable  reserves will be adjusted as appropriate 
as reserves are recorded  regulatory assets are recorded to the extent environmental expenditures are expected to be recovered through rates 
nisource is unable  at this time  to accurately estimate the time frame and potential costs of the entire program 
management expects that  as characterization is completed  additional remediation work is performed and more facts become available  nisource will be able to develop a probable and reasonable estimate for the entire program or a major portion thereof consistent with the security exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
which covers accounting and disclosures relating to loss contingencies  sfas no 
 and american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities sop no 

as of december   a reserve of approximately million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions 
the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors  including the volume of material contributed to the site  years of ownership or operation  the number of other prps and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response actions required 
based upon investigations and management s understanding of current environmental laws and regulations  nisource believes that any environmental response actions required  after consideration of insurance coverage  contributions from other prps and rate recovery  will not have a material effect on its financial position 
market conditions in the winter of  us wellhead gas prices peaked at over per dekatherm dth 
the unprecedented high prices were due primarily to tight supply and increased demand during this period 
demand was higher than in previous periods due to the continued economic expansion in  proliferation of gas fired electric generation and record cold weather during november and december lower production coupled with increased demand resulted in lower storage levels of natural gas entering the winter heating season 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
gas distribution operations continued the economic slowdown during contributed to lower demand 
reduced industrial production and fuel switching to coal  heating oil and distillate resulted in industrial throughput falling from its peak of over billion cubic feet bcf 
the steel industry  which has historically represented over two thirds of the industrial throughput in indiana and over one third of the industrial throughput in the major markets of ohio  pennsylvania and kentucky  was particularly hard hit with a number of companies filing for bankruptcy 
responding to higher natural gas prices  producers increased drilling activity  recording a record number of natural gas well completions during the increased production from these new wells along with the economic slowdown combined to create a brief period of excess gas supplies 
these factors coupled with a near record warm winter heating season resulted in prices for the winter declining to levels generally experienced during the s 
as natural gas prices in began declining  producers reduced the number of drilling rigs in operation 
this reduction in active drilling rigs resulted in fewer wells being drilled and a decline in production during the latter part of responding to lower drilling activity and increased demand from natural gas fired electric generation facilities  natural gas prices began to increase in early and continued to increase through the end of the year 
spot prices for the current winter period as represented by prices on the nymex  are in the dth range  significantly higher than the prices experienced during the winter season 
entering this winter  storage levels were near the top of the five year range  however  concerns over lower levels of natural gas production and near normal temperatures have sustained higher prices 
mid way through the winter season natural gas storage has returned to levels slightly below the trailing five year average 
given the reduced level of storage and lower projected production  natural gas prices are expected to continue at or near their current level through this winter heating season 
to date  the higher prices of late and early have not resulted in indications of increased levels of drilling 
recent drilling activity has been relatively stable from mid year at levels approximately one third lower than the peak reached during all nisource gas distribution companies have state approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs 
gas costs are treated as pass through costs and have no impact on the net revenues recorded in the period 
the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period and the difference is recorded on the balance sheet to be included in future customer billings 
the gas distribution companies have pursued non traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace 
these efforts include both the sale of products and services upstream of its service territory  the sale of products and services in its service territories and gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to its core markets 
the upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between the gas distribution company and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity products 
the on system services are offered by nisource to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the gas distribution company system 
the incentive mechanisms give the gas distribution companies an opportunity to share in the savings created from such things as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and its ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges 
the treatment of the revenues generated from these types of transactions vary by operating company with some sharing the benefits with customers and others using these revenues to mitigate transition costs occurring as the result of choice programs described above under regulatory matters 
capital expenditures the gas distribution segment s net capital expenditure program was million in and is projected to be approximately million in new business initiatives totaled approximately million in and are expected to be million in the remaining expenditures are for modernizing and upgrading facilities

thus under ferc procedures  northern indiana is required to submit a compliance filing  currently due by march  which will establish rates and services in compliance with the ferc s order and report on the magnitude of any refund liability resulting to northern indiana as a result of the proceeding 
northern indiana is in the process of determining the refund liability resulting from the ferc opinion 
environmental matters air 
in december  the epa approved regulations developed by the state of indiana to comply with epa s nox state implementation plan sip call 
the nox sip call requires certain states  including indiana  to reduce nox levels from several sources  including industrial and utility boilers  to lower regional transport of ozone 
the nox emission limitations in the indiana rules are more restrictive than those imposed on electric utilities under the clean air act amendments of caaa acid rain nox reduction program 
compliance with the nox limits contained in these rules is required by may  northern indiana plans to install selective catalytic reduction nox reduction technology at each of its active generating stations to comply with the rules and estimates capital costs will range from to million 
actual compliance costs may vary depending on a number of factors including market demand resource constraints  uncertainty of future equipment and construction costs  and the potential need for additional control technology 
the epa issued final rules revising the national ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter in july these rules were widely challenged 
on march   the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit largely upheld the ambient air standards as challenged 
consequently  designation of areas not attaining the standards  promulgation of rules specifying a compliance level  compliance deadline  and controls necessary for compliance will be completed over the next few years  which will likely change air emissions compliance requirements 
resulting rules could require additional reductions in sulfur dioxide  particulate matter and nox emissions from coal fired boilers including northern indiana s electric generating stations 
the epa and state regulatory authorities will set final implementation requirements 
nisource believes that the costs relating to compliance with any new limits may be substantial but are dependent upon the ultimate control program agreed to by the targeted states and the epa  and are currently not reasonably estimable 
nisource will continue to closely item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
electric operations continued monitor developments in this area 
however  the exact nature of the impact of the new standards on its operations will not be known for some time 
during  the epa initiated enforcement actions against several electric utilities alleging violations of the new source review provisions of the caaa and subsequently has issued additional information collection requests to many other utilities 
northern indiana has also received and responded to information requests from the epa on this subject over the last two years  most recently in june at this time  nisource is unable to predict the result of epa s review of northern indiana s information responses 
in november  epa announced reforms to the new source review rules that include two components 
the first  a final rule  does not appear to significantly impact northern indiana 
however  upon official publication of the rules by epa on december   nine northeastern states filed a legal challenge against the final rule in the us district court of appeals for district of columbia 
the second component is a proposed rule that is subject to further public comment and revision before finalization  therefore  northern indiana is unable at this time to evaluate its potential impacts on operations 
northern indiana will continue to closely monitor the developments related to both rules for potential impacts 
initiatives are being discussed both in the united states and worldwide to reduce so called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide  a by product of burning fossil fuels 
reduction of such emissions could result in significant capital outlays or operating expenses for northern indiana 
the caaa also contain other provisions that could lead to limitations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants 
in response to the caaa requirements  on december   the epa issued a finding that the regulation of emissions of mercury and other air toxics from coal and oil fired electric steam generating units is necessary and appropriate 
the epa expects to issue proposed regulations by december   and finalized regulations by december  the potential impact  if any  to nisource s financial results that may occur because of any of these potential new regulations is unknown at this time 
the epa is in the process of developing a program to address regional haze 
the new bush administration announced that the epa would move forward with rules that mandate the states to require power plants built between and to install the best available retrofit technology bart 
the bart program will target for control by those pollutants that limit visibility  namely particulate  sulfur dioxide and or nitrogen oxides 
until the program is developed  northern indiana cannot predict the cost of complying with these rules 
water 
the great lakes water quality initiative gli program is expected to add new water quality standards for facilities that discharge into the great lakes watershed  including northern indiana s three electric generating stations located on lake michigan 
the state of indiana has promulgated its regulations for this water discharge permit program and has received final epa approval 
as promulgated  the regulations would provide the indiana department of environmental management idem with the authority to grant water quality criteria variances and exemptions for non contact cooling water 
however  the epa revised the variance language and other minor provisions of idem s gli rule 
the epa by and large left the non contact cooling water exemption intact  however  a separate agreement between the epa and idem on interpretation of this exemption still leaves uncertainty as to its impact 
the epa change to the variance rule prompted litigation by the affected industrial parties and an agreement on the non contact cooling water exemption has been reached with epa idem 
northern indiana expects that idem will issue a proposed permit renewal for each of its lakeside stations 
pending issuance of these permits  the costs of complying with there requirements cannot be predicted at this time 
remediation 
northern indiana is a prp at three waste disposal sites under cercla and similar state laws  and shares in the cost of their cleanup with other prps 
at one site  the remediation plan has been implemented and long term monitoring is ongoing 
at another site  investigations are ongoing and final costs of clean up have not yet been determined 
at the third site  northern indiana has recently entered into an epa administrative order on consent to perform a removal action in the vicinity of a third party  state permitted landfill where northern indiana contracted for fly ash disposal 
epa and idem are currently evaluating the potential for remedial action at this site 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
electric operations continued as investigations and clean ups proceed at each of these sites  and as additional information becomes available  waste disposal site liability is reviewed periodically and adjusted 
in addition  northern indiana has corrective action liability under the rcra for closure and clean up costs associated with treatment  storage and disposal sites 
as of december   a reserve of approximately million has been recorded to cover probable environmental response actions at these sites 
the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors  including the volume of material contributed to the site  years of ownership of operations  the number of other prps and their financial viability and the extent of environmental response required 
based upon investigations and management s understanding of current environmental laws and regulations  nisource believes that any environmental response required will not have a material effect on the its financial position or results of operations 
capital expenditure program the electric segment s net capital expenditure program was million in and is projected to be approximately million in expenditures for included improvements related to the operational integrity of generation  transmission and distribution assets  expenditures related to environmental compliance nox reduction  and additions to electric distribution systems related to new business 
estimated expenditures for are approximately million for the nox compliance program 
the remaining expenditures are for new business initiatives and maintenance programs

primary energy project status 
primary energy is currently involved in six projects that produce electricity  steam or thermal energy on the sites of industrial customers 
five projects generate energy from process streams or fuel provided by the industrial customers 
the energy is then delivered to the industrial customers under long term contracts providing for tolling fees or processing fees 
one project  whiting clean energy  uses natural gas to produce electricity for sale in the wholesale markets and is expected to provide steam for industrial use 
in addition  a subsidiary of primary energy is a partner in a partnership that operates a coal pulverization facility 
two projects ironside and north lake are owned by subsidiaries of primary energy  while the remaining facilities are owned by unaffiliated special purpose entities and leased by primary energy subsidiaries 
primary energy s whiting clean energy project at bp s whiting  indiana refinery incurred delays primarily associated with remediating damage that occurred during commissioning in september the delays also resulted in an increase in estimated project costs 
in addition  the facility is not able at this time to deliver steam to bp to the extent originally contemplated without plant modifications 
whiting clean energy is seeking recovery of damages from the engineering  procurement and construction contractor and the insurance provider for the delays and necessary plant modifications 
the engineering  procurement and construction contractor has asserted that it fully performed under its contract and is demanding payment of the full contract price plus additional amounts for remediation 
whiting clean energy and the contractor were engaged in a dispute resolution process  as prescribed under their contract  relating to these claims 
however on december  the contractor filed a complaint with the court to have the claim adjudicated in that court rather than the arbitration process prescribed by contract 
the complaint also seeks to force foreclosure on the facility if the mechanics liens remain unsatisfied 
primary energy will seek to compel the issues to be arbitrated 
the whiting project was placed into service in primary energy estimates that the facility will operate at a loss in the near term based on the current market view of forward pricing for gas and electricity 
for  the after tax loss was million 
for  the after tax loss is projected to be approximately million 
the profitability of the project in future periods will be dependent on  among other things  prevailing prices in the energy markets and regional load dispatch patterns

accounting issues 
most of the primary energy projects were initially structured as synthetic leases where the lessors are special purpose entities and primary energy subsidiaries act as the lessees 
prior to june   the assets and related debt associated with these projects were not included in nisource s consolidated financial statements  which treatment was approved by nisource s former independent public accountants 
however  during the review of the second quarter  nisource determined in consultation with deloitte touche  its independent public accountants  that certain language contained in the operative agreements for four of the projects did not support characterization of those transactions as off balance sheet operating leases under eitf issue no 
 implementation issues in accounting for lease transactions  including those involving special purpose entities eitf no 
and eitf no 
the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction eitf no 

certain provisions in the operative documents for two transactions whiting clean energy  which was placed into service in early and ironside  which was placed into service january   which were subject to eitf no 
 could be interpreted to transfer substantial construction period risks to the lessee  resulting in the lessee being deemed the owner of the projects 
certain provisions in the other two leases cokenergy and portside could be interpreted to require the inclusion of certain default related obligations in minimum lease payments  resulting in the characterization of those leases as capital leases 
as a result of this determination  nisource changed the characterization of the leases associated with the four projects from synthetic leases to two owned assets and two capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
subsequently  during the third quarter a subsidiary of primary energy purchased the assets related to ironside and during the fourth quarter  a subsidiary of primary energy purchased the assets of another primary energy project northlake 
due to the change in the lease characterization and purchase of the ironside and north lake project assets  primary energy has recognized approximately million of assets and a corresponding amount of related debt on its balance sheet at december  the impact on the results of operations for prior periods due to the revised characterization was immaterial 
the recognition of the debt did not alter nisource s compliance with its debt covenants and is consistent with the treatment of such leases by the rating agencies in the analysis of nisource s credit ratings 
for the single leased project not affected by eitf no 
and eitf no 
 nisource has not included the assets or related debt associated with the facilities in its consolidated financial statements 
however  due to the issuance of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  if the leasing structure remains unchanged  nisource will reflect the assets and related liabilities of this project in its consolidated financial statements through consolidation of the related special purpose entity beginning in the third quarter of the aggregate unamortized funding for the project at december  was million 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
other continued lease information 
primary energy continues to lease four of the projects  three of which are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as capital leases or assets owned in substance 
nisource  through capital markets  has guaranteed or in substance guaranteed most lease payments to the lessors  including regular lease payments  accelerated lease payments on an event of default  and payment obligations  including residual guarantee amounts  at the end of lease terms 
in the case of an event of default  a lessor can accelerate the full  unamortized amount of the lessor s funding 
the aggregate unamortized funding for all of the leased projects at december  was million 
at the end of an initial lease term  the lessee has the right to purchase the facility for the unamortized amount of the lessor s funding 
if the lessee cannot satisfy return conditions  the lessee is required to purchase the facility at such price 
if the lessee determines not to purchase the facility and the lessee can satisfy the return conditions  the lessee may be responsible for a residual guarantee amount 
since the energy contracts with the industrial customers are long term and typically extend past the initial lease term  the lessee may refinance the property and negotiate to extend the lease term 
the present value of a lessee s aggregate liability for lease payments and residual guarantees is generally limited to an amount equal to less than of the amount advanced 
the following table shows  by year  future minimum rental payments  including maximum residual guarantee amounts and additional amounts due if the lessees were to purchase all of the facilities at the end of the initial terms of the leases 
minimum rental additional in millions payments payment total after in addition  a subsidiary of primary energy is a partner in a partnership  which operates a coal pulverization facility 
the partnership has entered into a lease of a undivided interest in the facility 
nisource has entered into a guarantee of all of the obligations of the partnership under the lease 
minimum rental payments under the lease are as follows in millions after in an event of default  the partnership will be required to pay a stipulated amount under the lease 
this amount was million as of december  environmental matters primary energy 
on june   epa issued a notice of violation nov to three companies involved with a project at ispat inland inc s east chicago  indiana facility  including primary energy s subsidiary  cokenergy 
the nov alleges violations of the construction permit requirements of the clean air act 
at issue is whether air emissions permitting requirements for major sources applied to the construction of the project in cokenergy representatives met with epa in mid september to discuss the details of the allegations 
at the september meeting  the epa indicated they would issue a request for additional information  as well as provide substantiation for the nov 
no requests or information have come from the epa 
cokenergy maintains its belief that the project item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued nisource inc 
other continued was properly permitted by the idem and  pending further discussion with epa  cannot predict whether any fines or penalties will be assessed or if additional compliance costs will be incurred 
in december  primary energy received notice from idem that it is reviewing the required removal efficiency for cokenergy s main stack desulfurization unit 
idem is exploring this as part of a rule revision to support redesignation of lake county  indiana to attainment of the sulfur dioxide national ambient air quality standards 
until this rulemaking is finalized  primary cannot predict if additional compliance costs will be incurred 
other affiliates 
nisource affiliates have retained environmental cleanup liability associated with some of its former operations including those of propane  petroleum and certain local gas distribution companies 
most significant environmental liability relates to former mgp sites whereas less significant liability is associated with former petroleum operations 
the ultimate liability in connection with these sites will depend upon many factors including the extent of environmental response actions required  other prps and their financial viability  and indemnification from previous facility owners 
only those corrective action costs currently known and determinable can be considered probable and reasonably estimable under sfas no 
and consistent with sop no 
as costs become probable and reasonably estimable  reserves will be adjusted as appropriate 
nisource believes that any environmental response actions required at former operations  for which it is ultimately liable  after consideration of insurance coverage and contributions from other prps  will not have a material adverse effect on nisource s financial position 
net operating revenues net operating revenues of million for decreased by million from the decrease in net revenues primarily resulted from nisource s decision to scale back its gas trading business  the change in value of nisource s gas and power marketing portfolios and the sale of sm p 
net operating revenues of million for decreased by million from this decrease is due to the sale of non core businesses  a mark to market loss on january east coast trades and limited trading opportunities partially offset by higher revenues in the line locating business 
operating income loss the other segment reported an operating loss of million  an improvement of million compared to the period 
the improvement was primarily attributable to reduced losses related to nisource s other non core subsidiaries  a million litigation settlement related to mhp affecting the period  a million reduction in reserves for estimated sales taxes of a subsidiary previously engaged in the gas marketing business  consolidation of facilities of million resulting from reorganization initiatives and a million gain on the sale of contracts associated with scaling back the energy trading operations 
the improvements were partly offset by an increase of million in depreciation and operating expenses associated with two recently completed cogeneration projects and a decrease of million in the value of the power trading portfolio  mainly from declines in prices and reduced volatility 
the other segment reported an operating loss of million in versus operating income of million in  reflecting the settlement of litigation related to mhp  the impact of winding down non core businesses  a mark to market loss on january east coast trades  limited trading opportunities and a fourth quarter charge of million related to the enron bankruptcy
