item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i of this report under the heading risk factors 
overview on january  we changed our name from inhale therapeutic systems  inc to nektar therapeutics 
we believe our new name better reflects our broadened capabilities and approach to drug delivery 
our new corporate identity represents the integration of our three proprietary technology platforms developed through our internal research and development efforts as well as our acquisitions of shearwater corporation now referred to as nektar al and bradford particle design  ltd 
now referred to as nektar uk 
we are working to become one of the world s leading drug delivery products based companies by providing a portfolio of technologies and expertise that will enable us and our pharmaceutical partners to improve drug performance throughout the drug development process 
we have been unprofitable since inception and forecast incurring substantial operating losses over the next few years 
we forecast a decrease in internally funded research spending in the next three to five years  due to the combination of the completion of scale up and commercial readiness spending  the shifting of infrastructure spending to cost of goods sold for commercial product sales  and the anticipated partnering of our proprietary projects 
to date  except for sales from four products using nektar molecule engineering based on our advanced pegylation technology  we have not sold any commercial products and do not anticipate receiving significant revenue from product sales or royalties in the near future 
for the period from inception through december   we incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million 
the sources of our working capital have been equity offerings and convertible debt financings  financings of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  interest earned on investments of cash  and revenues from product sales  short term research and feasibility agreements and development contracts 
to date we have been primarily dependent upon equity and convertible debt financings to fund our working capital 
we have generally been compensated for research and development expenses during initial feasibility work performed under collaborative arrangements for all three of our technologies nektar molecule engineering  nektar particle engineering  and nektar delivery solutions 
in a typical collaboration  our partner will provide the drug  fund clinical and formulation development  obtain regulatory approvals and market the resulting commercial product 
we will supply the drug delivery approach and drug formulation 
we will receive revenues from drug formulation manufacturing and other manufacturing activities  as well as royalties from sales of most commercial products 
in addition  for products using nektar delivery solutions technology  we expect to receive revenues from the supply of our pulmonary inhaler for the product along with any applicable drug processing 
partners that enter into collaborative agreements generally fund research and development through expense reimbursements and or payments as we achieve certain key development and regulatory milestones 
to achieve and sustain profitable operations  we  alone or with others  must successfully develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture  introduce  market and sell products using our drug delivery and other drug delivery systems 
there can be no assurance that we can generate sufficient product or contract research revenue to become profitable or to sustain profitability 
recent developments in march  we announced that pharmacia corporation s somavert received fda approval for the treatment of certain patients of acromegaly 
this product has already been approved in europe 
under the terms of our agreement with pharmacia  we will receive manufacturing revenue based on the sale of the peg reagent 
in march  we announced we have created a new executive position to drive development and implementation of management and operations processes to achieve our growth and profitability objectives 
brigid a 
makes  our former chief financial officer and vice president of finance and administration  was named to this new senior management position  vice president of operations management 
ajay bansal has joined us as our new chief financial officer and vice president of finance and administration 
in january  we announced an agreement with the straumann group to license  manufacture and supply our peg based hydrogel technology for dental regeneration products 
under the agreement  straumann will license and source our peg based hydrogel technology material exclusively for proprietary formulation 
we will receive milestone and manufacturing payments as well as royalties on commercialized products 
in january  during pfizer s quarterly financial results conference call  pfizer commented that it would not file an nda for approval of exubera in there can be no assurance that pfizer will file for an nda approval of exubera and  if such filing is made  there can be no assurance that pfizer will obtain fda approval to market exubera 
the failure to file for or obtain regulatory approval of exubera would significantly harm our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas provides guidance related to accounting for costs associated with disposal activities covered by sfas or with exit or restructuring activities previously covered by emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas supersedes eitf in its entirety 
sfas requires that costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring not be recognized until the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees  and provides new disclosure requirements regarding indemnification provisions  including indemnification provisions typically included in a license arrangement 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and that the company must disclose that information in its financial statements 
however  the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  see note  commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of part ii  item  of this form k 
we do not expect the implementation of fin to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
the statement does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
the statement s amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirement of sfas are effective for the fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial conditions and results of operations 
we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employee  to account for employee stock options 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provision of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  in october  we entered into a build to suit lease transaction with a real estate partnership to finance and manage construction of our san carlos research and office facility 
we have fully consolidated this entity into our consolidated financial statements since inception 
accordingly  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  and accrued liabilities to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
revenue from grants and feasibility arrangements are recognized when the cash has been received and the final product has been delivered to the customer 
our research revenue is derived primarily from clients in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and consists of reimbursement of development costs  reimbursement of certain expenses  payment of clinical supplies and amortization of milestones 
payments received for milestones achieved are deferred and recorded as revenue ratably over the next period of continued development 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts  estimated product returns and discounts 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
stock based compensation we grant stock options to our employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and we account for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
under apb  when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on goodwill and other intangible assets  assembled workforce was reclassified as goodwill and is subject to an impairment assessment 
we have adopted a policy for measuring goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
to date  no such impairment losses have been recorded 
our goodwill balance decreased from december  due to certain purchase price adjustments related to our acquisition of shearwater 
in accordance with the new accounting standard adopted on january   the totals for the year ended december  do not include amortization of goodwill and are comprised solely of amortization of other intangible assets 
had amortization of goodwill been continued beyond january   we would have recognized an additional million in amortization expense during the year ended december  the totals for the year ended december  and includes million and million of amortization of goodwill  respectively 
accrued liabilities certain accrued liabilities  such as accrued research and development  accrued general and administrative  accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities  reflect management s best estimates based on our specific historical experience and understanding of industry practice 
the basis for accounting estimates has been consistently applied and reviewed on a quarterly as well as annual basis 
we record a reserve for these matters when an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of the potential liability can be reasonably estimated 
results of operations years ended december   and revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased in compared to levels and increased in compared to levels 
the increase in revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  and the increase in revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   were both primarily due to increased activities under our existing collaborative agreement with pfizer and revenues from our acquired subsidiaries in pfizer represented of our revenue for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  product sales through nektar al accounted for of revenues for the year ended december   as compared to of revenues for the year ended december  product sales for the year ended december  reflected only six months of activity after the acquisition of nektar al was completed 
contract research revenue for the years ended december   and included reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and progress payments received from our collaborative partners 
contract revenues are expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract revenue cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract revenues depends in part upon future success in obtaining timely completion of feasibility studies  the continuation of existing collaborations  and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 
product sales are dependent upon regulatory approval of new products for sale and adoption of current products in the market and cannot be accurately predicted 
cost of goods sold is associated with product sales and was million for the year ended december  based on product sales of million 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million based on product sales of million 
there were no product sales and therefore no cost of goods sold in the year ended december  research and development expenses were million for the year ended december   as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributed to the increased spending on partner funded programs and the operating expenses of our nektar al subsidiary 
in addition  we made a one time payment of million to alliance for the rights beyond pulmonary applications for pulmosphere technology and other considerations for the year ended december   which was expensed as research and development 
the increase for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily attributable to increased spending related to the development effort for both partner and internally funded programs  the scale up of technologies and the continuing development of global manufacturing capabilities for both inhalation devices and drug powders in order to support exubera clinical trials and preparation for commercial production commercial readiness  as well as the addition of expenses related to our acquisitions 
we expect research and development spending to increase over the next few years as we continue to expand our development efforts under collaborative agreements using our expanded technology portfolio and to support our commercial manufacturing operations 
we forecast a decrease in internally funded research spending in the next three to five years  due to the combination of the completion of scale up and commercial readiness spending  the shifting of infrastructure spending to cost of goods sold for commercial product sales  and the anticipated partnering of our proprietary projects 
our research and development activities can be divided into research and preclinical programs  clinical development programs and commercial readiness 
we estimate the costs associated with research and preclinical programs  clinical development programs and commercial readiness over the past three years to be the following in thousands years ended december  research and preclinical programs    clinical development programs    commercial readiness    general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to incremental support associated with our manufacturing and development efforts  including administrative staffing  business development and marketing 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily due to increased support associated with our manufacturing and development efforts  including administrative staffing  business development and marketing  as well as additional expenses related to our acquisitions included in our operations 
in december  we recorded a charge of million related to a workforce reduction of employees  which represents about of our base employees 
the reduction affected all business functions and job classes mainly at our san carlos facility 
the million charge included million in severance compensation  million in health benefits and million in out placement services 
approximately million was non cash related to stock compensation 
approximately million of this amount is included in research and development costs and million is included in general and administrative costs 
during december  million was paid out associated with severance and other employee benefits 
at december   we had a remaining accrual of million of which million was paid out in the first quarter of the remaining million is expected to be paid out during the second quarter of we forecast that this workforce reduction will reduce operating expenses by approximately million 
purchased in process research and development ipr d represents the portion of the purchase price of an acquisition related to research and development activities which i have not demonstrated their technological feasibility  and ii have no alternative future uses 
for the year ended december   we did not incur any ipr d charges 
for the year ended december   we incurred charges of million related to our acquisitions of bradford particle design and shearwater corporation 
for the year ended december   we incurred charges of million for an acquisition of an in process technology 
in june  we completed our acquisition of shearwater in exchange for approximately million shares or options to acquire shares of our common stock and cash of million 
of the total purchase consideration of million  million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  including million in goodwill and other intangible assets 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d  which was determined to have no alternative future use and was charged as an expense during the year ended december  in january  we acquired all of the outstanding share capital of bradford particle design in exchange for approximately million in newly issued shares of our common stock and approximately million in cash 
of the total purchase consideration of million  million was allocated to the assets acquired based on their fair value on the date of acquisition  including million in goodwill and other intangible assets 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d  which was determined to have no alternative future use and was charged as an expense in the year end ended december  in  we recorded a million charge for acquired ipr d costs 
the acquisition was recorded as a purchase and million of the purchase price was allocated to ipr d and charged as an expense in the year ended december  as of the date of the acquisition  the in process technology had no alternative future use and did not qualify for capitalization 
amortization of other intangible assets expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and this expense item increased million from the year ended december  to december  and the million increase from the year ended december  to the year ended december  was due to the acquisition activity in there was no amortization of goodwill expenses for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease between the year ended december  and the year ended december  was associated with the adoption of sfas  business combinations  and sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting standards on january  with respect to business combinations 
no impairment charges have been recorded for the year ended december  in accordance with sfas and  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill and our assembled workforce intangible asset  which resulted in a decrease in reported net loss by approximately million in  as compared to the accounting prior to the adoption of sfas and see note  goodwill and other intangible assets in the notes to consolidated financial statements of part ii  item of this form k 
the million increase in amortization expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was due to our acquisition activities 
there was no debt conversion premium  net  recorded for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   million in expense was recorded associated with the conversion of our october convertible subordinated debentures and february convertible subordinated notes into common stock 
other income expense  net  was million expense for the year ended december   as compared to million expense and million income for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our equity investment in alliance was determined to be impaired and a loss of million and million was recorded in the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of million associated with the sale of our alliance shares 
interest income was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and the million decrease in interest income for the year ended december  as compared to december  was due to our lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
the million increase in interest income for the year ended december  as compared to december  was due to our maintaining larger cash and investment balances  including the proceeds of our issuance of several offerings of convertible subordinated notes and debentures and higher interest rates 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and the million increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to december  relates to the interest expense on our capital lease obligation associated with our build to suit lease for additional space leased at the end of the million increase in interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to december  relates to the full year s interest expense for the convertible subordinated notes issued in october and the full year s interest expense associated with our build to suit lease in at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
these carryforwards will expire beginning in the year through  if not utilized 
utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to substantial annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided for by the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating loss carryforwards before utilization 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of our debt and equity securities  revenue from development contracts  product sales and short term research and feasibility agreements  financing of equipment acquisitions and tenant improvements  and interest income earned on our investments of cash 
we do not utilize off balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing 
at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million 
year ended december  in millions  except current ratio cash  cash equivalents and short term investments current ratio cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above our operations used cash of million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net operating loss for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding periods for the years ended december  and differed from cash used in operations due to several factors 
for the year ended december   the million of cash used in operations primarily reflects the net loss of million  partially offset by depreciation and other changes in our balance sheet 
during  there were no charges for ipr d  amortization of goodwill or net debt conversion premiums 
for the year ended december   the million of cash used in operations primarily reflects our net loss of million  partially offset by million of ipr d associated with our acquisitions  million in amortization of goodwill expenses  depreciation and changes in the balance sheet 
for the year ended december   the million cash usage primarily reflected the net loss of million  partially offset by the million in net debt conversion premiums  ipr d of million associated with an acquisition of technology  depreciation and changes in the balance sheet 
cash flows provided by investing activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million cash used for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows for the year ended december  were generated primarily by the sale and maturity of investment securities 
these cash proceeds were either reinvested or used in operations 
cash used for investing activities in was primarily related to our acquisition activity 
in connection with our acquisition of bradford  we paid net cash of million  which represented cash paid to their shareholders of million  net of bradford s cash balance of million 
the remainder of this acquisition was non cash in nature 
in connection with our acquisition of shearwater  we paid net cash of million  which represents cash paid to their shareholders of million  net of shearwater s cash obtained at june  of million 
we purchased property and equipment of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and respectively 
the decrease in purchased property and equipment in as compared to and  primarily reflects the completion of the second phase of construction of a new san carlos laboratory and office facility offset by continued investment in our commercial manufacturing facilities  including device manufacturing at third party contract manufacturers and expansion of our san carlos power processing facility 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million of the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows provided by financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to december  was primarily related to our strategic alliance with enzon which included a million investment in our preferred stock offset by a decrease in capital lease financing related to our san carlos lab facility that was substantially completed in the decrease in cash flow provided by financing activities in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the net proceeds received in from the sale of convertible subordinated notes that was completed in in october  we entered into a financing arrangement with a real estate partnership to complete construction of existing office facilities and provide financing for future capital improvements of up to million 
as a result of our continuing involvement and significant influence in the real estate partnership  and other provisions in the leasing transactions  the facility costs and capital lease obligations of the real estate partnership are recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
in february and october  we received approximately million and million  respectively  in net proceeds from the sale of convertible subordinated notes 
this includes net payments of approximately million and million in connection with agreements that provided for the conversion of approximately million and million of our october and february debentures respectively  into common stock 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payment due by period total less than year years years after years tenant improvement loan   build to suit lease      interest payable     operating leases      principal amount of convertible subordinated notes and debentures other obligations   in august  we entered into a supply agreement with two contract manufacturers to provide for the manufacturing of our inhalation device 
under the terms of the agreements we may be obligated to reimburse both parties for the actual unamortized and unrecovered portion of any equipment procured or facilities established and the interest accrued for their capital overlay in the event that inhaleable insulin does not gain fda approval to the extent that the contract manufacturers cannot re deploy the assets 
at the present time  it is not possible to estimate the loss that will occur should inhaleable insulin not be approved 
we forecast that research and development expenses will continue at current levels or higher through at least the next couple of years 
research and development expenses are associated with three general categories i collaborative agreements under which spending is reimbursed by our partners  ii spending attributed to internally funded programs  and iii commercial readiness and infrastructure costs associated with commercial operations for our drug and third party device manufacturing 
we forecast a decrease in internally funded research spending in the next three to five years  due to the combination of the completion of scale up and commercial readiness spending  the shifting of infrastructure spending to cost of goods sold for commercial product sales  and the anticipated partnering of our proprietary projects 
we expect our cash requirements to continue at a comparable rate due to expected activities in these areas 
research and development costs will be dependent upon the number of collaborative agreements we are engaged in  the number of nektar funded projects and the timing of our transition to commercial manufacturing of our san carlos  alabama and uk locations 
given our current cash requirements  we forecast that we will have sufficient cash to meet our net operating expense requirements for at least the next two years 
we plan to continue to invest in our growth and the need for cash will be dependent upon the timing of these investments 
our capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development arrangements  progress with preclinical and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and the rate of scaling up each manufacturing operation of our technologies  the timing and cost of our late stage clinical and early commercial production facility  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
of our convertible subordinated notes and debentures  million and million will mature in and  respectively 
we may not be able to satisfy these obligations through cash flow generated by our operations 
to satisfy our long term needs  we intend to seek additional funding  as necessary  from corporate partners and from the sale of securities 
because we are an early stage biotechnology company  we do not qualify to issue investment grade debt or have access to certain credit facilities 
as a result  any financing we undertake will likely involve the issuance of equity  convertible debt instruments or high yield debt to fund our working capital 
to date we have been primarily dependent upon equity and convertible debt financings for capital and have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes and debentures that are convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for our financial position and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
approval of non audit services during the year ended december   the audit committee of the board of directors approved recurring engagements to provide non audit tax services with ernst young llp  our independent accountants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  the potential change noted above is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease less than in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  increases in the interest rates could adversely affect the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes and debentures  which pay a fixed rate of interest 
as of december   we had approximately million in outstanding convertible subordinated notes and debentures with a fair value of million
