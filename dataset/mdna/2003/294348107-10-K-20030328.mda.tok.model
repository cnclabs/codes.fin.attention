these facility closures and employee separation activities were substantially completed during included in the million impairment charge for certain assets is an amount recorded for the impairment of the unamortized portion of the value of the switchboard common stock issued and amounts prepaid to aol 
switchboard assessed the value of its assets related to its aol directory agreement for impairment as revenues were lower at the end of the first year of the directory agreement than originally anticipated 
based upon an impairment analysis which indicated that the carrying amount of these assets would not be fully recovered 
table of contents through estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows  a charge of million was recorded by switchboard as an additional component of special charges during the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded the present value of the estimated discounted future cash flows attributable to these assets 
in december  switchboard exercised its rights under the envenue acquisition agreement to substantially reduce the funding of envenue 
switchboard evaluated the carrying value of its goodwill in envenue  and determined it would not be fully recovered through estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
as a result  during the three months ending december   switchboard recorded as a component of the million impairment charge for certain assets an impairment charge of million related to the envenue goodwill 
the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded the present value of the estimated discounted future cash flows attributable to these assets 
also included in the impairment charge for certain assets are amounts related to prepaid advertising expenses 
as a result of switchboard s change in overall strategy from a destination site to a technology provider  switchboard no longer considered this prepaid advertising to be complementary to its corporate strategy 
accordingly  switchboard recorded million for the impairment of these prepaid advertising assets 
of the total million facilities and severance charge  which is net of the million special credit recorded in  switchboard currently estimates that million is cash related 
as of december   million of the original million accrual had been utilized 
a liability of million remains on both our consolidated balance sheet and switchboard s balance sheet as of december  relating to the special charges 
consolidated other income expense and income taxes consolidated other income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in is primarily due to the liquidation of our openwave position in as well as our minority interest share of decreased losses in switchboard and a reduction in interest income 
the increase in was due primarily to a gain on sale of openwave stock of approximately million for the increase in was also due to the minority share of increased losses in switchboard 
while we incurred significant pretax losses in and  we recorded a provision for income taxes in each of those years 
the provision for income taxes in is primarily for state income taxes 
we recorded no tax benefit on our operating losses for the year ended december   due to the uncertainty of its realization 
the provision for income taxes in is primarily the result of the significant gain on the sale of openwave stock and due to the fact that switchboard s results and net operating losses are not consolidated with ours for income tax purposes 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of all of our deferred tax assets 
because we believe it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  valuation allowances of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively were recorded 
of the valuation allowances for the years ended december  and  respectively   and  pertains to switchboard  while  and  pertains to the services segment 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
this was negatively impacted by our deconsolidation of switchboard for tax purposes  as switchboard s net losses are not included in our tax return  upon our percentage ownership change on june  other matters on january  we were party to two separate hedging contracts related to our investment in openwave 
since we did not designate these hedges  the fair market value of these hedges million at january  
table of contents was recorded as an asset and  accordingly  we recorded a cumulative effect in accounting change  net of taxes  of million an earnings per share impact of 
upon liquidation of the openwave investment  these hedges were terminated and were offset against the gain from the sale of openwave 
these changes had no effect our consolidated net income for the period ending december  aside from these hedges  at january  and through december   we were not party to any other derivative instruments

liquidity and capital resources at december   consolidated cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash were million  of which million was held by epresence and million was held by switchboard 
at december   consolidated cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash were million  of which million was held by epresence and million was held by switchboard 
consolidated working capital increased from million at december  to million at december  cash and cash equivalents  excluding restricted cash of million and million for and  respectively  increased million resulting in a consolidated cash balance of million at december  this increase was primarily due to net cash used in operating activities of million and cash used in financing activities of million offset in part by cash provided by investing activities of million as follows 
net cash used in operating activities in of million was primarily due to a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and a decrease in deferred revenues of million 
these uses were offset in part by the non cash charge for the impairment of goodwill of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in other current assets of million  the non cash portion of our restructuring and switchboard s special charges of million  and depreciation and amortization of million 
we expect liquidity and capital resources to continue to decrease during  primarily as a result of anticipated continued operating losses 
net cash used in financing activities in of million was primarily due to payments on capital leases and notes payable by switchboard of million  million in stock repurchases by switchboard and million in stock repurchases pursuant to the company s stock buyback program 
these uses were offset  in part  by proceeds from issuance of notes payable of million by switchboard 
net cash provided by investing activities in of million was primarily related to the proceeds from sale of marketable securities of million  offset  in part  by capital expenditures of million and by an increase in restricted cash of million 
on december   the board of directors of epresence authorized the repurchase of up to million of its common stock on the open market 
repurchases of stock are at management s discretion  depending upon acceptable prices and availability 
funds used in the repurchase of shares come from our existing cash and investment balances along with cash generated from operations 
as of december   we have expended million toward stock repurchases pursuant to this repurchase program 
for a discussion of our lease commitments  see note  commitments and contingencies  in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which are incorporated from item herein 

table of contents the following table summarizes our consolidated long term contractual obligations as of december  less than year years total in thousands switchboard s envenue note payable operating lease obligations other long term obligations a total a consists of scheduled principal payments on switchboard s financing agreement with silicon valley bank svb 
on november   we entered into a million revolving line of credit with svb  that provides for borrowings at svb s prime rate 
this credit agreement has a one year term and contains covenants relating to the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
we had no borrowings under this line of credit outstanding at december  in june  switchboard entered into a loan and security agreement with svb the svb financing agreement  under which switchboard has the ability to borrow up to million for the purchase of equipment 
amounts borrowed under the facility accrue interest at a rate equal to prime plus  and are repaid monthly over a month period 
as of december   switchboard had utilized million of this facility 
the facility provided for the ability to fund additional equipment purchases of up to million through march  switchboard did not utilize the facility in the three months ended march  to fund additional equipment purchases 
the agreement also provides for a million revolving line of credit 
at december   switchboard had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit 
as a condition of the svb financing agreement  switchboard is required to maintain in deposit or investment accounts at svb not less than of its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
additionally  covenants in the agreement require switchboard to maintain in deposit or in investment accounts with svb at least million in unrestricted cash 
as part of the transition to svb  switchboard liquidated million in marketable securities previously held at fleet for transfer to svb 
as a result of this liquidation  switchboard recorded  in realized gains during these amounts have been transferred to svb 
we believe that existing cash and marketable securities  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our operations through at least the next months 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  consolidation of switchboard results with its financial results  impairment of long lived assets and valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
revenue recognition we recognize services revenues pursuant to time and material contracts generally as services are provided 
services revenues pursuant to fixed fee contracts are generally recognized as services are rendered on the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs with revisions to estimates reflected in the period which changes become known 
service revenues include customer reimbursements for out of pocket expenses 
our services business derives a significant portion of its revenue from fixed price  fixed time contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
if we do not accurately 
table of contents estimate the resources required or the scope of time to satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then future consulting margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
any such resulting reductions in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations 
switchboard generates its revenue primarily from its merchant network and banner and site sponsorship advertising 
generally  revenue is recognized as services are provided  so long as no significant obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
switchboard believes that they are able to make reliable judgments regarding the creditworthiness of its customers based upon historical and current information available to them 
there can be no assurances that their payment experience with their customers will be consistent with past experience or that the financial condition of these customers will not decline in future periods  the result of which could be switchboard s failure to collect invoiced amounts 
some of these amounts could be material  resulting in an increase in our provision for bad debts 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers on an ongoing basis and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable at december  are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers one customer accounts for of consolidated accounts receivable at december   a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
restructuring charges we established exit plans for each of the restructuring activities which took place in and and accounted for these plans in accordance with eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
and sab  management makes certain judgmental estimates related to these restructuring charges 
we specifically identified all positions which were to be eliminated and notified the affected employees prior to the end of the quarter in which the related restructuring charge was recorded 
the consolidation of facilities required us to make estimates including with respect to contractual rental commitments or lease buy outs for office space being vacated and related costs  and leasehold improvement write downs  offset by estimated sub lease income 
we review on at least a quarterly basis our sub lease assumptions 
these estimates include anticipated rates to be charged to a sub tenant and the timing of the sub lease arrangement 
if the rental markets change  our sub lease assumptions may not be accurate and changes in these estimates might be necessary but would not materially affect our financial condition and results of operations 
for a further discussion of our restructuring activities  see note  restructuring charges  in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   which are incorporated from item herein 
consolidation of switchboard results with the financial results of the company historically  switchboard s results have been consolidated with our financial results  due to either our majority ownership of switchboard or our control of the switchboard board of directors as a result of a voting rights agreement by and among the company  switchboard and viacom 
however  in january  as a result of the termination of this voting rights agreement and our ownership then being  we ceased to consolidate switchboard s results with our financial results  for the first three quarters of in connection with the 
table of contents viacom transaction discussed in note in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements  we became owner of approximately of switchboard s outstanding stock in october this change in ownership percentage resulted in us retroactively consolidating switchboard s revenues  expenses and other income and expense in our consolidated statement of operations  while the minority interest in switchboard was eliminated through consolidated other income and expense as of january  accordingly  the results of operations for  and respectively  are presented consistently herein on a consolidated basis 
in addition  switchboard s assets and liabilities are consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and december  at december   we owned  shares or an approximate equity interest of switchboard s outstanding common stock 
as a result of the consolidation of switchboard s results  our consolidated financial results and condition are materially affected by switchboard s financial results and condition 
our consolidated financial results and condition would also be materially affected if in the future switchboard s financial results and condition ceased to be consolidated with ours impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets include goodwill and acquired intangible assets pursuant to our acquisition of epresence  inc currently named epresence web consulting  inc in january and our acquisition of strategic network designs  inc currently named epresence crm  inc 
in may at december   we had million of goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for approximately of our total assets 
we evaluate the net realizable value of our goodwill and intangibles on an ongoing basis  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  budgets  economic projections and undiscounted cash flows 
in addition  our evaluation considers non financial data such as market trends  project development cycles and changes in management s market emphasis 
during  based on economic conditions and each business unit s actual and forecasted operating results  it became apparent that the carrying value of the acquired intangible assets and goodwill had been impaired 
in september  a charge of million was recorded related to the impairment of goodwill measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the present value of the estimated discounted future cash flows for goodwill 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill 
we had recorded approximately million of amortization during and would have recorded approximately million of amortization during in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of and ceased amortizing goodwill with a net book value of million as of the beginning of fiscal we completed an assessment of fair value of goodwill in the second quarter of and updated the assessment in the third quarter of due to a continued decline in economic conditions 
neither of these assessments indicated an impairment of goodwill 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we completed our yearly assessment of fair value of goodwill  and based upon this impairment analysis  the results indicated that the carrying amount of the goodwill would not be fully recovered through estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows and an impairment charge of million was recorded during the year ended december  the impairment of goodwill was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the present value of the estimated discounted future cash flows attributable to such goodwill 
valuation of deferred tax assets as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that 
table of contents our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carryforwards and tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax asset as of december  was zero  net of a valuation allowance of million

in accordance with eitf no 
 reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
eitf no is effective for all financial reporting periods beginning after december   and upon adoption there is a requirement to present comparative prior period financial information 
we have historically accounted for reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as revenue and recorded the applicable cost as cost of revenue 
as a result  the adoption of eitf no did not have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

eitf is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   and early application is permitted

without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  expects  anticipates  plans  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include the following factors the continuing stock market decline  broad economic slowdown and global political uncertainty has affected the demand for services  lengthened the sales cycles and caused decreased technology spending for many of our customers and potential customers 
if companies continue to cancel or delay their business and technology consulting initiatives because of the current economic and political climate  or for other reasons  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
during and in  we restructured our operations through workforce reductions and office closures 
such restructurings could have an adverse effect on our business  including on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees  and there can be no assurance that we will achieve the anticipated financial benefits of these restructurings 
in addition  there can be no assurance that our workforce reductions will not have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results in the future 
our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to grow our services business  enter into new strategic alliances  acquire additional services customers and adapt to changing technologies and customer requirements 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have a limited operating history as a services company 
in addition  the market for our consulting services and the technologies used in our solutions have been changing rapidly and we expect this level of change to continue 
if we cannot keep pace with these changes in our marketplace  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in our strategic focus on services  including sim services 
we sell our services principally through a direct sales force to customers in a broad range of industries 
we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
conditions affecting any of our clients could cause them to become unable or unwilling to pay us in a timely manner  or at all  for services we have already performed 
our financial results and condition could be adversely affected by credit losses 

table of contents we have a number of partnerships and alliances with software vendors under which we provide services around such vendors products 
any failure of these alliances to generate the anticipated level of sales  the loss of one or more of these alliances  or the failure to enter into additional strategic alliances  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are dependent upon the continued services of our key management and technical personnel 
in addition  as a services company  our business is particularly dependent on our employees 
competition for qualified personnel is strong  and there can be no assurance we will be able to attract and retain qualified management and other employees 
we were not profitable during and  and there can be no assurance we will return to profitability in or in any future period 
continued losses could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses  such as personnel and rent  are and will continue to be fixed in the short term 
we may not be able to quickly reduce spending if our revenues are lower than we had projected 
as a result  an unanticipated decrease in the number  or an unanticipated slowdown in the scheduling  of our projects may cause significant variations in operating results in any particular quarter and could have a material adverse effect on operations for that quarter 
if we do not achieve our expected revenues  our operating results will be below our expectations and the expectations of investors and market analysts  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly operating results have varied significantly in the past and will likely vary significantly in the future  making it difficult to predict future performance 
these variations result from a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
because of this difficulty in predicting future performance  our operating results will likely fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the market for our products is highly fragmented and characterized by continuing technological developments  evolving and competing industry standards  and changing customer requirements 
we expect competition to persist and intensify in the future 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
many of these companies can also leverage extensive customer bases  have broad customer relationships and have broad industry alliances  including relationships with certain of our current and potential customers 
in addition  certain competitors may adopt aggressive pricing policies or may introduce new services 
competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers and could require us to reduce the price of our services 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to compete successfully with existing or new competitors 
our failure to maintain and enhance our competitive position would limit our ability to retain and increase our market share  resulting in serious harm to our business and operating results 
our future success depends on the increased acceptance and use of advanced technologies as a means for conducting commerce and operations 
if use of these advanced technologies does not continue to grow  or grows more slowly than expected  our revenue growth could slow or decline and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
businesses may delay adoption of advanced technologies for a number of reasons  including inability to implement and sustain profitable business models using advanced technologies  inadequate network infrastructure or bandwidth  delays in the development or adoption of new technical standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of usage  delays in the development of security and authentication technology necessary to effect secure transmission of confidential information  and failure of companies to meet their customers expectations in delivering goods and services using advanced technologies 
our services rely upon third party technologies 
our business could be harmed if providers of such software and technology utilized in connection with our services ceased to deliver and support reliable products  enhance 
table of contents their current products in a timely fashion or respond to emerging industry standards 
in addition  if we or our customers cannot maintain licenses to key third party software  provision of our services could be delayed until equivalent software could be licensed and integrated into our services  or we might be forced to limit our service offerings 
either alternative could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
some of our contracts can be canceled by the customer with limited advance notice and without significant penalty 
termination by any customer of a contract for our services could result in a loss of expected revenues and additional expenses for staff which were allocated to that customer s project 
we could be required to maintain underutilized employees who were assigned to the terminated contract 
the unexpected cancellation or significant reduction in the scope of any of our large projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our projects are based on fixed price  fixed timeframe contracts  rather than contracts in which payment to us is determined on a time and materials basis 
our failure to accurately estimate the resources required for a project  or our failure to complete our contractual obligations in a manner consistent with the project plan upon which our fixed price  fixed timeframe contract was based  could adversely affect our overall profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects in the past  which has resulted in losses on those contracts 
we will likely experience similar situations in the future and the consequences could be more severe than in the past  due to the increased size and complexity of our engagements 
in addition  we may fix the price for some projects at an early stage of the process  which could result in a fixed price that turns out to be too low and  therefore  would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any failure by us to effectively identify and acquire complementary businesses or sim focused software  integrate such businesses or software  as the case may be  and any failure of such companies or software to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on us 
any acquisition for cash could have a significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources  and any acquisition for stock could involve significant dilution for our stockholders 
we own  shares of switchboard s common stock  which is traded on the nasdaq national market 
the trading price of switchboard s common stock is likely to be volatile and may be influenced by many factors  including  without limitation  variations in financial results  changes in earnings estimates by industry research analysts  the failure or success of branding and strategic initiatives and investors perceptions 
volatility in the trading price of switchboard s common stock could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  due to our level of ownership of switchboard  the trading price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the trading price of switchboard s common stock 
if switchboard s trading price declines  the trading price of our common stock will likely decline as well 
switchboard s results of operations are consolidated as part of our results of operations 
switchboard  which has a history of incurring net losses  expects its net losses to continue partially through and may never achieve profitability 
in addition  switchboard s quarterly results of operations have fluctuated significantly in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
factors that may cause switchboard s results of operations to fluctuate include the success of switchboard s relationship with aol  the addition or loss of relationships with third parties that are switchboard s source of new merchants for its local merchant network or that license switchboard s services for use on their own web sites  switchboard s ability to attract and retain consumers  local merchants and national advertisers to its web site  the amount and timing of expenditures for expansion of switchboard s operations  including the hiring of new employees  capital expenditures and related costs  technical difficulties or failures affecting switchboard s systems or the internet in general  the cost of acquiring  and the availability of  content  including directory information and maps  switchboard s expenses  which are largely fixed  particularly in the short term  are partially based on expectations regarding future revenue  the cost and risks associated with any acquisition  and switchboard s ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial and technical personnel 

table of contents in addition  switchboard has only a limited operating history and until march had no operating history as a stand alone company and no experience in addressing various business challenges without the support of a corporate parent 
it may not be successful as a stand alone company 
william p 
ferry  our chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  is switchboard s chairman of the board  and richard m 
spaulding  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  and robert m 
wadsworth  one of our directors  are directors of switchboard 
serving as a director of switchboard and as either a director or an officer of epresence could create  or appear to create  potential conflicts of interest when those directors and officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us than for switchboard 
such conflicts  or potential conflicts  of interest could hinder or delay our management s ability to make timely decisions regarding significant matters relating to our business 
because of the foregoing factors and the other factors we have disclosed from time to time  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and you should not rely upon these comparisons as indicators of our future performance 
we expect that our results of operations may fluctuate from period to period in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marketable securities and interest rates we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
our marketable securities as of december   are invested in us agencies bonds and notes and repurchase agreements 
the majority of our investments have maturities between one and three years 
a significant portion of our cash is invested in short term interest bearing securities 
while we have in the past used hedging contracts to manage exposure to changes in the value of marketable securities  we are not currently a party to any such contract 
we may use hedging contracts in the future 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of our investment portfolio 
these potential changes are based on sensitivity analysis performed on our balances as of december  foreign currency prior to january   our subsidiaries generally used the local currency as the functional currency 
assets and liabilities were translated into us dollars at the period ended exchange rate and income and expense amounts were translated using the average rate prevailing for the period 
adjustments resulting from translation were included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
as of january   our remaining subsidiaries began using the us dollar as the functional currency as we had substantially liquidated our remaining foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  the translation gains losses are included in net loss for prior cumulative translation gains losses within accumulated comprehensive income have been reversed and included in the net loss in to date  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material effect on our operating results or financial condition
