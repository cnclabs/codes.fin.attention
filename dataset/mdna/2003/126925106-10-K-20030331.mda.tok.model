item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in canada  which  except as described in note of the accompanying financial statements  conform  in all material respects  with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements include the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory excess and obsolescence reserves  discounts  allowances and rebates  income tax valuation allowances and impairment reviews for investments  fixed assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is at least reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s estimates related to doubtful accounts 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  and rebates 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased estimates of sales returns and allowances resulting in incremental reductions to revenue 
we maintain allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these estimates are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust inventory levels to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions become less favorable than anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
management reviews intangible assets  investments and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and on an interim basis when events or circumstances change 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected to arise from these assets 
future cash flows may be adversely impacted by operating performance  market conditions  and other factors 
if an impairment is indicated by this analysis  the impairment charge to be recognized  if any  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if actual future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
discussion of impairment charges is located within the company s management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report

rapid technological change and voice data convergence cabletel expects that data communications traffic will grow substantially in the future compared to the modest growth expected for voice traffic 
the growth of data traffic is expected to have a significant impact on traditional voice networks and create market discontinuities that should drive the convergence of data and telephony 
many of the company s traditional customers have already been investing in data networking and that trend is expected to continue 
due to the evolving nature of the communications industry and the technologies involved  there can be no assurance as to the rate of such convergence 
rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions  and relatively short product life cycles characterize the markets for cabletel s products 
the company s success is expected to depend  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing technological and product developments achieved by its competitors 
the success of new or enhanced products is dependent on a number of factors including the timely introduction of such products  market acceptance of new technologies and industry standards  and the pricing and marketing of such products 
an unanticipated change in one or more of the technologies affecting telecommunications and data networking  or in market demand for products based on specific technology could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company if it fails to respond in a timely and effective manner to such changes 
competition all aspects of cabletel s business are highly competitive 
cabletel competes for sales with national  regional and local distributors  wholesalers and manufacturers of products for the cable television industry 
various manufacturers that supply cabletel also sell their products to canadian cable television operators directly or through commissioned agents 
in addition  because of the convergence of the cable telecommunications and computer industries and rapid technological development  new competitors may seek to enter the canadian cable television distribution market 
many of cabletel s competitors or potential competitors are substantially larger and have greater resources than the company 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins  and loss of market share  each of which could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations  and financial condition of the company 
cabletel s commodity products compete on the basis of price and delivery time 
cabletel s higher technology products  such as transmitters and receivers  compete on the basis of product and specifications and functionality  as well as price 
capital spending of key customers changes in spending patterns of cabletel s key customers will have a direct effect on the results of the company s operations and financial condition 
in particular  sales to rogers cable systems limited  east link cablesystems  persona communications inc  shaw communications inc  and cogeco cable inc  cabletel s largest customers which have accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of the company s total sales for the month period ending december   of the company s total sales 
any future decision by rogers cablesystems limited or east link cablesystems to reduce purchases could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
international growth  foreign exchange  and interest rates cabletel is exposed to various market risks  including interest rates and foreign currency rates 
changes in these rates may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
to manage the volatility relating to these typical business exposures  cabletel may enter into various derivative transactions  when appropriate 
cabletel does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
as at december   the company had no material contracts denominated in foreign currencies 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of sales of its products in various foreign countries and manufacturing operations conducted is israel 
in addition  the company s distribution segment imports approximately of its products from the united states for resale in canada 
in order to minimize the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  most sales contracts are issued in either canadian or us dollars 
the company constantly monitors the exchange rate between the us dollar  the canadian dollar and the new israel shekel to determine if any adverse exposure exists relative to its costs of manufacturing 
the company does not maintain new israel shekel denominated currency 
instead  us dollars are exchanged for shekels at the time of payments 
cabletel intends to continue to pursue growth opportunities in international markets 
in many international markets  long standing relationships  including local content requirements and type approvals  create barriers to entry 
in addition  pursuit of such international growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before returns on such investments  if any  are realized 
such projects and investments could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in opening of foreign markets to new competitors  exchange controls  currency fluctuations  investment policies  repatriation of cash  naturalization  social and political risks  taxation and other factors  depending on the country in which such opportunities arise 
difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies  and of foreign financial institutions  could adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries 
in order to grow internationally  it is expected that the company will be required to provide significant amounts of customer financing in connection with the sale of products and services 
general industry and market conditions and growth rates cabletel s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors that must be managed in order to achieve desired operating results 
in addition  there are trends and factors beyond the company s control  which affect its operations 
such trends and factors include general domestic or global economic conditions as well as competitive  technological  and regulatory developments and trends specific to the company s industry  customers and markets 
these conditions and events could be substantially different than believed or expected and these differences may cause actual results to vary materially from the forward looking statements made or the results which could be expected to accompany such statements 
cabletel competes in a highly volatile and rapidly growing industry that is characterized by vigorous competition for market share and rapid technological development carried out amidst uncertainty over adoption of industry standards and protection of intellectual property rights 
these factors could result in aggressive pricing practices and growing competition both from start up companies and from well capitalized communication companies 
consolidations in the telecommunications industry the telecommunications industry has experienced the consolidation of many industry participants and this trend is expected to continue 
cabletel and one or more of its competitors may each supply products to the corporations that have merged or will merge 
this consolidation could result in delays in purchasing decisions by the merged corporations with the company playing a greater or lesser role in supplying the communications products to the merged entity 
these purchasing decisions of the merged companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
mergers among the supplier base have recently increased and this trend is also expected to continue 
the larger combined companies with pooled capital resources may be able to provide solution alternatives with which the company would be put at a disadvantage to compete 
the larger breadth of product offerings these consolidated suppliers could provide could result in customers electing to trim their supplier base for the advantages of one stop shopping solutions for all their product needs 
these consolidated supplier companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial conditions 
current and future strategic alliances and acquisitions will play a strong role in the company s ability to compete within this changing landscape
