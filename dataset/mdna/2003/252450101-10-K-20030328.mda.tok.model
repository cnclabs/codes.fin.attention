automated laboratory systems a systems provider  dpc designs and manufactures laboratory instruments and software to automate the performance of immunodiagnostic assays  facilitating rapid  accurate results  while reducing labor and reagent costs 
the company has two principal immunoassay platforms 
dpc s immulite addresses the needs of high volume laboratories  while the immulite serves lower volume facilities and niche markets 
at the end of  over  immulite and over  immulite systems had been shipped 
the original immulite system was first introduced in computer driven  it uses a patented solid phase wash technology and chemiluminescent detection method  which together are capable of measurements at exceptionally low concentrations  as demonstrated by dpc s state of the art third generation assays for tsh and psa key tests related to thyroid disorders and prostate cancer  respectively 
the system is totally automated with respect to sample and reagent handling  incubation  washing  and substrate addition 
dpc s immulite has the capacity for walk away processing of up to samples per hour  on a random access basis meaning that it can perform any test  or combination of tests  on any patient sample at any time 
in  the company ceased manufacturing the immulite and began manufacturing the immulite this system has essentially the same operational features and runs the same tests as the immulite  but it utilizes updated operating software and is capable of performing certain dilutions on board 
in addition  it has a new exterior appearance 
going forward  the company will refer to the immulite as the immulite 
the immulite  dpc s next generation system  was introduced in the third quarter of it has a throughput of up to tests per hour  offering the medium to high volume laboratory increased efficiency in streamlining its testing workload 
the immulite can run for a full shift without having to replenish on board supplies 
this increased throughput allows dpc to participate in a higher volume segment of the market where the average reagent use per instrument exceeds that of the original immulite 
the immulite includes advanced features such as primary tube sampling and a proprietary autodilution capability 
the system can also be interfaced with robotic laboratory sample handling systems and can be connected to the customer s computer system for specification of the tests to be run on each sample  as well as for reporting and archiving results 
another innovative feature is its remote diagnostic capability that permits dpc s service facility to access any immulite 
table of contents worldwide for the purpose of diagnosing system problems 
enhancements introduced in september made it possible for laboratories to perform fully automated in vitro allergy testing 
in  as in the previous year  the growth of dpc s business and the company s role as an ivd systems provider for high volume facilities was driven primarily by ongoing demand for the immulite in the first quarter of  the company obtained distribution rights from medical electronic systems of israel to a sperm analyzer that dpc will market under the name spermalite sqa v 
the spermalite is a stand alone  benchtop high performance analyzer that provides rapid reliable semen analysis in less than seconds 
in  dpc expects to launch a major new instrument  the sms sample management system  that will provide additional flexibility to the immulite the sms will provide a bulk sample platform allowing as many as samples to be loaded or unloaded at any one time 
high volume sample management improves workflow  flexibility  and productivity 
the sms will also eventually function as a universal robotic interface that can be linked to almost any of the workcell automated systems available 
immunodiagnostic test kits dpc manufactures over immunodiagnostic test kits  exploiting several technologies and assay formats 
the company s monoclonal antibody  molecular engineering  and other basic science capabilities play key roles in optimizing these immunoassays 
chemiluminescence enhanced enzyme immunoassays are the basis for dpc s automated immulite and immulite product lines 
dpc also manufactures classic radioimmunoassays rias  based on double antibody  coated tube  and irma formats  as well as enzyme immunoassays eias in microplate format 
allergy testing uses a proprietary liquid allergen technology in tube and microplate formats  and it is now fully automated on the immulite many of dpc s assays are available both as manual rias and as immulite and immulite assays 
the automated  non isotopic product lines represent the core of dpc s business 
immulite and immulite assays  instruments  and service represented   and of sales in   and  respectively  a trend that is expected to continue 
in fiscal year  dpc s rias accounted for of sales  while microplate allergy and other non immulite products accounted for 
for additional information concerning sales by product line over the last three fiscal years  see notes to consolidated financial statements note breadth of menu immulite and immulite are closed systems  they will not perform other manufacturers tests 
accordingly  a most important factor in the successful marketing of these systems is the ability to offer a broad menu of individual assays and assay groups  that is  tests which jointly represent decision making panels for various disease states  such as thyroid disorders or infertility 
many of the relevant disease states represent either high volume opportunities in the marketplace  or unique  under served conditions that allow dpc to fill a market niche 
during  dpc released eight new assays on the immulite and fourteen new assays on the immulite as of december   dpc had immulite assays available in the international market  with fda cleared for sale in the us 
in addition  out of a total of of the most important assays on the second generation immulite have been released for sale in the us 
dpc believes that the immulite and immulite have the most extensive menus of any automated immunoassay systems on the market 
the company s research and development activities continue to focus on expanding the menus  giving special attention to complete implementations of clinically important assay groups  as well as on developing new generations of instrumentation and software 
the spectrum of applications major clinical applications of dpc s immunoassays include the following areas  where dpc s extensive and sometimes unique offerings on the immulite and immulite have enabled the company to achieve a significant presence in various types of laboratories  large and small 
thyroid disorders for many hospital and clinical reference laboratories  thyroid testing is a mainstay of their routine immunoassay work 
dpc offers a comprehensive spectrum of assays for assessing and monitoring thyroid status on both the immulite and the immulite the menus include not only assays for free and total thyroid hormones  but also assays with third generation capability for thyroid stimulating hormone tsh and assays for thyroid autoantibodies and other relevant analytes which are increasingly in demand 
this combination represents a complete  high quality solution for thyroid testing 

table of contents therapeutic drug monitoring tdm there is a large market for tdm assays tests for the routine monitoring of certain therapeutic drugs 
nine of the ten most frequently monitored drugs are measured by immunoassay 
infertility  pregnancy dpc has been an innovator and longtime market leader in reproductive hormone testing  providing an unusually broad spectrum of assays for both routine and specialized laboratories  supplemented by studies to aid in the interpretation of results and software to facilitate data manipulation  when appropriate 
some of dpc s assays reflect the special needs of fertility clinics and in vitro fertilization ivf centers 
others are important for the routine assessment of osteoporosis and hormone balance in postmenopausal women and aging men 
dpc offers a comprehensive menu of immunoassays for maternal and fetal diagnosis  monitoring  and risk assessment 
the company s growing menu relates to medical conditions in every phase of reproductive life in men  women  and children of all ages 
cancer dpc has automated a large number of assays for tumor markers on the immulite and immulite  more than any of our competitors 
the company has a number of unique offerings  including third generation assays capable of measuring the extremely low psa concentrations encountered after radical prostatectomy 
in partnership with matritech  in dpc released the first automated assay for nmp  a marker for bladder cancer 
infectious diseases infectious disease testing is one of the fastest growing segments of the ivd market and one which has generally lagged behind in automation 
dpc s commitment in this area is reflected in its development of one of the broadest menus available on an automated platform  it includes some unique assays  eg for h 
pylori  an organism responsible for stomach ulcers 
in  dpc received fda approval for a total of hepatitis b assays providing the most complete panel of automated assays available 
in addition  the company introduced assays for the epstein barr virus and chagas  further increasing its menu of infectious disease tests 
allergy in vitro allergy testing  representing a worldwide market of approximately million  has been dominated for the last years by pharmacia corp 
traditionally  such testing has required special laboratory equipment and has been time and labor intensive  and somewhat error prone due to the lack of full automation 
with its patented liquid allergen technology  dpc established itself as the second leading supplier of in vitro allergy test kits 
in  the company introduced assays for selected allergy screening panels on the immulite 
then  in september  dpc introduced a broad spectrum of assays for individual allergens on the immulite  finally making it possible for laboratories to perform high volume allergy testing along with other routine immunoassays on a fully automated system 
the immulite can provide tests for over allergens  representing over of allergy requests 
dpc added new allergens to the immulite in and will continue to add assays in the future 
as a complement to immulite allergy  dpc has developed a product line alablot of confirmatory western blotting assays 
inflammatory conditions cytokines  often referred to as hormones of the immune system  represent potentially important disease markers  which are being actively investigated in major centers throughout the world 
in europe and elsewhere  assays for clinically relevant cytokines are already in routine use  eg for the management of bacterial sepsis blood poisoning in intensive care units 
dpc is the only company to offer a significant menu of cytokine assays in an automated format 
moreover  dpc offers some novel tests  having obtained  for example  exclusive rights from xoma ltd 
to market an automated immunoassay for lbp lipopolysaccharide binding protein  a marker of inflammation reflecting systemic exposure to gram negative bacteria 
cardiovascular disease this is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed nations and represents a million worldwide market  which continues to show very strong annual growth 
both on the immulite and the immulite  dpc now offers the most comprehensive cardiac menu available on a single platform 
the three principal assays required on an emergency basis due to their role in diagnosing acute myocardial infarction troponin i  ck mb  and myoglobin have been implemented on the immulite with turbo software  which reduces the assay time to minutes  along with other tests needed in an emergency room or intra operative setting hcg  pth 
additional assays on dpc s automated systems  including high sensitivity crp and homocysteine  put the company in an excellent position to address all aspects of cardiac testing  from diagnosis and patient management to risk assessment 
research and development activities the company devotes substantial resources to research and development to update and improve its existing products  as well as to develop new products and technologies 
in addition to developing and adding allergy testing capabilities to the immulite  the company s research and development activities include the development of the next generation immulite system and new operating software for both the immulite and the immulite r d capabilities in the united states include fully staffed departments in organic synthesis  biochemistry  
table of contents antisera hybridoma  protein chemistry  molecular biology  and infectious disease  method development  instrumentation  software  and technology development 
during the years ended december    and  the company spent   and  respectively  on research and development 
the company is engaged in an aggressive development program for new instrument systems  including the sample management system  a robotic sample handling device that enhances the functionality of the immulite  the immulite immulite xt  which incorporates the turbo function into the immulite  the immulite  a very high throughput immunoassay system incorporating several new technologies to deliver optimal assay performance  and the immulite  a scaled down version of the immulite in addition  the company continues to work in the area of molecular diagnostics 
manufacturing and service the company s principal test kit manufacturing facility is located in los angeles  california 
approximately of test kit production is conducted at the euro dpc facility in the united kingdom 
the company s european manufacturing facilities enable the company to improve its competitiveness in the european economic area eea by minimizing import duties and freight charges 
certain kits are also manufactured by dpc in china 
dpc s instrument division in new jersey designs and manufactures immulite instrumentation and engages in software development 
component parts  such as computer hardware  are supplied by original equipment manufacturers 
the company provides a one year warranty that covers parts and labor 
underwriter s laboratories inc ul list the immulite systems 
the company s and its distributors technical service personnel install new units  train customers in the use of the system  and provide maintenance and service for the instrumentation 
the euro dpc instrumentation division in the united kingdom manufactures certain components of the immulite and immulite instruments that are then assembled into the final instrument in new jersey 
dpc s los angeles  new jersey  and china facilities are international standards organization iso registered 
euro dpc limited  the company s wholly owned manufacturing subsidiary in wales  was the first immunodiagnostics company in the world to be registered under british standard bs euro dpc is also registered to iso and the european en standards 
dpc provides technical support for all its products  including reagents  instruments  and software  via telephone and on site service 
in dpc introduced real time service on the immulite system 
real time service connects an installed immulite instrument to dpc s technical support department through a secure network connection to provide constant hour monitoring and support 
should a particular system function begin to fail or degrade  an alert will be sent to a technical support representative 
marketing and sales the company markets its products to hospital  clinical  forensic  research  reference  and veterinary laboratories  as well as doctors offices and us government agencies 
the company markets its products in the united states directly to laboratories and hospitals through its own sales force 
the company sells to the us doctors office market through independent distributors as well as through its own sales force 
sales personnel and distributors are trained to demonstrate the company s product line in the customer s laboratory and are supported by the company s los angeles and new jersey based technical services departments 
the company s products are sold on a worldwide basis through distributors in over foreign countries 
these distributors  including affiliated distributors  also sell other manufacturer s products that are not directly competitive with the company s products 
foreign sales including export sales  sales to non consolidated foreign affiliates  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries represented approximately in and in and europe accounted for approximately of total sales in  in  and in see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding foreign operations 
sales of test kits to customers and distributors are made against individual purchase orders as well as through volume purchase arrangements 
products are shipped directly from the company s facilities in los angeles and wales and are generally delivered domestically within hours and overseas within hours of receipt of order 
the company sells  leases  or rents the immulite instrumentation to hospitals and reference laboratories that perform volume testing 
the company s backlog at any date is usually insignificant and not a meaningful indicator of future sales 
the company s foreign operations are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  political and economic instability  and trade restrictions 
because the company s consolidated foreign distributors sales are in the respective local currencies  the company s consolidated financial results are affected by foreign currency translation adjustments 
in addition  the price competitiveness of the company s products abroad is 
table of contents impacted by the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
proprietary and other rights substantially all of the company s products are based on proprietary technologies and know how 
the company holds various us and foreign patents  including patents on the washing process used in the immulite system that expire in and patents on its novel liquid based amplification methodology which forms the basis of the alastat product lines which expire in the company also obtains licenses for chemical components and technologies used in certain of its assays 
patents that may be granted to others in the future could inhibit the company s expansion or entry into certain areas  or require it to pay royalty fees to do so 
because of rapid technological developments in the immunodiagnostic industry with concurrent extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents  certain of the company s products may involve controversy concerning infringement of existing patents or patents that may be issued in the future 
the company purchases certain chemical compounds that are key components in the immulite system from lumigen  inc and tropix  inc  the sole suppliers of these chemical compounds  pursuant to agreements that terminate in tropix also supplies the company with certain other chemical compounds for use in veterinary kits 
upon termination of these supply agreements  the company will be required to enter into new supply agreements or use alternate technologies 
if obtainable  such technology must have the same performance characteristics of the technology currently in use 
the company owns an interest in lumigen  inc and accounts for this interest using the equity method 
government regulation the company s business is affected by government regulations both in the united states and abroad  in particular western europe and japan  aimed at containing the cost of medical services 
these regulations have generally had the effect of inhibiting the growth rate of the immunodiagnostic industry 
the company believes that in vitro diagnostic ivd testing is an important tool for reducing health expenditures 
by providing early diagnosis and therapy management  ivd tests can reduce the high costs of hospitalization  surgery  and recovery 
in response to cost containment measures  hospitals  and laboratories have consolidated and have sought to increase productivity by replacing high cost labor with automated testing systems 
the company s automated systems address these market needs 
the company also seeks to develop more rapid and sensitive tests  such as dpc s third generation tsh assay  that can eliminate the need for redundant testing 
manufacturers of immunodiagnostic tests and other clinical products intended for use as human diagnostics are governed by fda regulations as well as regulations of state agencies and foreign countries 
a new in vitro diagnostic product that is substantially equivalent to one already on the market can generally be sold in the united states after it is cleared for marketing by the fda 
most of the company s products fall within the substantially equivalent category 
certain medically critical in vitro diagnostic products and totally new in vitro diagnostic products  for which there are no equivalents on the market  must be approved by the fda after in depth review that normally takes about two years prior to marketing 
the company s los angeles manufacturing facilities are licensed by the california department of health services and must be operated in conformance with the fda s good manufacturing practices governing medical devices 
the company is regulated by the california department of health services with respect to its possession and use of radioactive substances and by the us drug enforcement agency with respect to the use and storage of controlled drugs and pharmaceuticals 
given the company s high proportion of sales to the european union eu countries  the company has undertaken the necessary steps to comply with the eu in vitro diagnostic directive ivdd 
the company was fully compliant with all relevant aspects of the eu ivdd on june  and therefore was qualified to apply the ce mark to most of its ivd kits and instruments as mandated by the directive 
many other countries outside of the eu have accepted the ce mark to fulfill their local requirements or are developing equivalent regulations 
dpc is prepared to comply with these and future ivdd regulations 

table of contents competition the company s major competitors are broad based health care companies such as roche diagnostics  abbott diagnostics abbott laboratories  bayer  johnson johnson  beckman coulter  and pharmacia upjohn sweden 
the company competes on a worldwide basis with a number of large corporations that sell diversified lines of products  including immunodiagnostic products  for laboratory  medical  and hospital use 
the fact that these companies offer diversified products to the laboratories at times puts the company at a competitive disadvantage 
there are currently over domestic suppliers of immunodiagnostic kits 
the company believes that competition in immunoassay testing is based on quality  service  product convenience  and price and that product innovation is an important source for change in market share 
the principal competitive factors in automated systems are size of menu the number of assays that can be performed on the system  ease of use  and price equipment cost  service  and reagent cost 
the company s immulite system currently offers one of the widest menus of any automated system and the company is focusing its development efforts on expanding this menu 
employees as of december   the company including its consolidated subsidiaries had  employees  including in manufacturing  in research and development  in marketing and sales  and in administration 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union  and the company considers its employee relations to be good 
the company has experienced no significant problems in recruiting qualified technical and operational personnel

these forward looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties  and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward looking statements 
these risks and uncertainties include our ability to successfully market new and existing products  our ability to keep abreast of technological innovations and successfully incorporate them into new products  our current dependence on sole suppliers for key chemical components in the immulite assays  the risks inherent in the development and release of new products  such as delays  unforeseen costs  technical difficulties  and regulatory approvals  competitive pressures  including technological advances and patents obtained by competitors  environmental risks related to substances regulated by various federal  state  and international laws  currency risks based on the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar  domestic and foreign governmental health care regulation and cost containment measures  political and economic instability in certain foreign markets including trade restrictions  changes in accounting standards promulgated by the financial accounting standards board  the securities and exchange commission  or the american institute of certified public accountants  and the effects of governmental or other actions relating to the chinese subsidiary s payments 
results of operations sales the company s sales increased in to million compared to sales of million in  which was a increase over sales of million 
sales of all immulite products instruments and reagents were million  a increase over in  sales of all immulite products were million  a increase over sales of immulite products represented of sales  of sales  and of sales 
sales of the company s original immulite instrument  the immulite one  related reagents  and service were million  a decrease from sales of immulite one reagents decreased to million  while instrument and service sales were down to million 
in  sales of the immulite product line decreased to million 
the decrease in immulite sales is a result of immulites being replaced by immulite s  new immulite replacements going into lower reagent volume environments  and a lower number of instruments being sold 
the immulite instrument had sales including reagents of million in  a increase over sales of million 
sales of immulite reagents increased to million  while instrument sales and service increased to million 
in  sales of the immulite product line increased in  as in the previous year  the growth of dpc s business was driven primarily by ongoing demand for the immulite in the fourth quarter of  the company began shipping an updated version of the immulite one 
demand for the original immulite continues to be strong  and the company believes that it remains an important complement to the higher throughput  state of the art immulite the immulite has a longer sales process than the immulite one due to the higher sales price 
the company has also experienced a longer time delay between instrument placement and the ramp up of reagent sales with the immulite as of december    and  the company had shipped on a cumulative basis approximately   and  immulite instruments  respectively 
this installed base of instruments and an expanding test kit menu are expected to support continued growth in the coming years 
sales of the company s mature ria or isotopic products  million in  were down from million in sales in increased slightly from it is expected that these sales levels will decline in the future 
sales of other dpc products decreased to million in  compared to million in these sales were negatively impacted in due to the september introduction of a broad spectrum of allergy assays on the immulite  which has taken sales away from the company s microplate based allergy system 
the 
table of contents company also experienced a slight increase in sales of non dpc products through its consolidated international affiliates to million in from million in it is anticipated that sales of non dpc products will decline in the future 
domestic sales increased in over  and in over  reflecting in part the company s continued success with larger customers and purchasing organizations and indirect distribution into smaller doctor s office laboratories 
foreign sales including us export sales  sales to non consolidated foreign subsidiaries  and sales of consolidated subsidiaries as a percentage of total sales were approximately in and and in europe  the company s principal foreign market  represented   and of sales in   and  respectively 
sales in germany increased to million in from million in  and million in  reflecting the success of the immulite product line 
sales in the brazil region  which includes certain other central and south american countries  accounted for approximately of total sales  or million  in  compared to million in and million in although sales rose in local currency  sales were flat in and declined in in dollars due to the devaluation of the brazilian real  relative to the dollar  which has fallen from less than in to at the end of the company intends to continue to increase prices over time in brazil  but it may not be able to fully compensate for continuing significant devaluations 
to date the company s unit sales in brazil have continued to increase in line with the company s overall sales increase 
due to the significance of foreign sales  the company is subject to currency risks based on the relative strength or weakness of the us dollar 
in periods when the us dollar is strengthening  the effect of the translation of the financial statements of consolidated foreign affiliates is that of lower sales and net income 
in periods when the dollar is weakening  the impact is the reverse 
based on comparative exchange rates in the immediately preceding year  the translation adjustments due to the strong us dollar had a negative impact on sales and there was a negative impact on sales 
in  the dollar weakened relative to the euro and net of the negative impact of the real the currency effect was a slight positive impact 
the company s hedging strategy in reduced the positive impact of the strong euro in the latter part of the year 
the company s results should reflect the benefits of a strong euro by the second half of due to intense competition  the company s foreign distributors are generally unable to increase prices to offset the negative effect when the us dollar is strong 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company discovered internally that its chinese subsidiary had made payments to certain customers in china that may have violated foreign and us law  including the foreign corrupt practices act 
the company stopped the payments immediately  and the board of directors conducted an independent investigation of the nature of the payments  the involvement of company personnel  and whether similar situations existed at the company s other foreign operations 
based on the results of the investigation  the audit committee concluded that senior management of the company was not implicated in the payments and that there are no apparent similar issues with respect to the company s other foreign operations 
the company s disclosure committee has conducted a comprehensive review of the company s other foreign operations and internal control procedures as they relate to these issues and additional policies and procedures have been implemented to ensure compliance with applicable laws 
in  the company s chinese subsidiary had revenues of million  less than of the company s total sales 
depending on how these chinese issues are resolved  the company s sales in china could be significantly impacted 
cost of sales gross margin improved slightly to in from in and in the improvement in gross margin was due in part to the shift in product mix toward immulite reagents  the shift in customer mix toward domestic end users  and increased manufacturing efficiencies 
although the company expects these mix trends to continue  it is also experiencing competitive pricing pressures that may negatively impact gross margins 
all products manufactured in the united states are sold in dollars  therefore a weakening dollar could improve gross margins and a strengthening dollar could weaken gross margins 
margins in were also negatively impacted by the devaluation of the brazilian real  the effects of which have not been fully overcome by price increases in that region 
in  the company will relocate its brazilian distribution center  which should result in reduced tariffs and improved gross margins for this region 

table of contents operating expenses and other total operating expenses selling  research and development  and general and administrative as a percentage of sales fell to in  from in and in  although all categories increased annually in absolute dollars to support the increased levels of sales 
general and administrative expenses in included million for costs incurred through year end relating to the investigation of the chinese payments and for estimated penalties and or fines which the company may incur to resolve issues relating to this matter 
equity in income of affiliates represents the company s share of earnings of non consolidated affiliates  principally the owned italian distributor 
this amount increased in relative to and in relative to  primarily due to increased earnings of the italian distributor 
in and  equity in income of affiliates included a  permanent benefit and a  benefit  respectively  due to a change in the italian tax laws 
net interest and other income expense represents the excess of interest income and interest earned on equipment contracts relating to immulite placements over interest expense and other amounts of income and expense 
net interest income and other income was an expense of  in versus expense of  in the amount included approximately  in foreign exchange losses versus approximately  in in addition  the company experienced a  increase in local tariffs in brazil 
the amount of  income included  among other things  a gain of  on the sale of a product line  a gain of  on the sale of a building  and foreign exchange losses of income taxes and minority interest the company s effective tax rate in and and in includes federal  state  and foreign taxes 
in the fourth quarter of the company s tax provision includes an accrual of million relating to the possible non deductibility of payments in china 
the company expects that its effective tax rate will be lower in minority interest represents the interest in the company s brazilian distributor held by a third party 
increases or decreases in this amount reflect increases or decreases in the profitability of the brazilian distributor 
net income net income of million per diluted share increased over net income of million per diluted share  which was a increase over net income 
these increases were primarily due to increases in sales and gross profit that were greater than percentage increases in operating expenses 
excluding the non recurring tax accrual of million and million general and administrative expense discussed above  net income in would have increased over to million or per diluted share 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  allowance for bad debts  allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventories  useful lives selected for depreciating property  plant  and equipment  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes  and estimates used in the recoverability of long lived assets 
management believes that the methodology it utilizes to determine these amounts results in the reporting of reasonable estimates and that the differences between the estimates and actual results are usually minor and are included in the consolidated financial statements by management as soon as they are known 
liquidity and capital resources the company has adequate working capital and sources of capital to carry on its current business and to meet its existing capital requirements
