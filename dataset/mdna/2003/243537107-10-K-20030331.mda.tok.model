teva wholesale sales represented and of net sales in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in teva wholesale sales was largely attributable to an improvement in retail sell through  strength in sales of the company s sport sandals and the introduction of the new fall line of closed toe rugged outdoor footwear 
also  certain european distributors brought in  more of the upcoming spring season s product in the fourth quarter of than they did in the fourth quarter of  a portion of which is likely a shift in sales between the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of this shift in quarterly sales is expected to result in reduced european deliveries in the first quarter of compared to net wholesale sales of footwear under the simple product line decreased to  from  for the year ended december   which decline was attributed to a shortfall in the international markets of

use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures about contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company bases these estimates and assumptions upon historical experience and existing  known circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company provides a reserve against receivables for estimated losses that may result from its customers inability to pay 
the company determines the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions  historical experience and the customers credit worthiness 
receivables which are subsequently determined to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
reserves have been fully established for all expected or probable losses of this nature 
the gross trade accounts receivable balance was million and the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  reserve for sales discounts 
a significant portion of the company s domestic net sales and resulting accounts receivable have an associated discount which the customers may take  generally based upon meeting certain order  shipment and payment timelines 
the company estimates the amount of discounts  which are expected to be taken against the period end accounts receivable  and records a corresponding reserve for sales discounts 
the company determines the amount of the reserve for sales discounts considering the amounts of available discounts in the period end accounts receivable aging and historical discount experience  among other factors 
at december  the reserve for sales discounts was approximately million 
allowance for estimated returns

in general  the company accepts returns for damaged or defective products  but discourages returns for other reasons 
the amount of the allowance is determined based upon any approved customer requests for returns  historical returns experience  and any recent events which could result in a change in historical returns rates  among other factors 
the allowance for returns at december  was million 
inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market

inventories were stated at million  net of a reserve for inventory write downs of million at december  
table of contents valuation of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
the company periodically assesses the impairment of goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets based on assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
among other considerations  the following factors are considered the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  the company s future plans regarding utilization of the asset  any changes in legal ownership of rights to the asset  and changes in customer demand or acceptance of the related brand names  products or features associated with the assets 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  as it relates to long lived assets  the company bases the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on the estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by the company

 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge in the first quarter of see full discussion under recently issued pronouncements 
litigation reserves 
estimated amounts for claims that are probable and that can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in the expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income  the ability to deduct tax loss carryforwards against future taxable income  and the effectiveness of the company s tax planning
