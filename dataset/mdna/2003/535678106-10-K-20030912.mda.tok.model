item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require it to make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company regularly evaluates these estimates  including those related to inventory valuation and revenue recognition 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed by management to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  which may impact the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation the company values inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the company records charges to write down inventories for unsalable  excess or obsolete raw materials  work in process and finished goods 
newly introduced parts are generally not valued until success in the market place has been determined by a consistent pattern of sales and backlog among other factors 
in addition to writedowns based on newly introduced parts  statistical and judgmental assessments are calculated for the remaining inventory based on salability and obsolescence 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales made directly to customers is recognized upon the transfer of title  which generally occurs at the time of shipment 
revenue from the company s sales to domestic distributors is recognized under agreements which provide for certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
as a result  the company defers recognition of such sales until the domestic distributors sell the merchandise 
the company relieves inventory and records a receivable on the initial sale to the distributor as title has passed to the distributor and payment is collected on the receivable within normal trade terms 
the income to be derived from distributor sales is recorded under current liabilities on the balance sheet as deferred income on shipments to distributors until such time as the distributor confirms a final sale to its end customer 
the company s sales to international distributors are made under agreements which permit limited stock return privileges but not sales price rebates 
revenue on these sales is recognized upon shipment at which time title passes 
the company estimates international distributor returns based on historical data and current business expectations and defers a portion of international distributor sales and profits based on these estimated returns 
such amounts are classified in deferred income on shipments to distributors on the accompanying balance sheet 
results of operations the table below states the income statement items as a percentage of net sales and provides the percentage change of such items compared to the prior fiscal year amount

to partially offset the impact of reduced sales on net profits during fiscal and the company reduced its variable expenses primarily in the area of compensation 
the company achieved this by reducing profit sharing and by having plant shutdowns during fiscal and during fiscal the entire company had five fewer one week shutdowns when compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year 
additionally  during fiscal the company raised the profit sharing payout when compared to fiscal  which was reduced substantially from fiscal due to having fewer shutdowns during the year and increased profit sharing the company had greater compensation costs throughout the cost of sales and operating expense lines when compared to the previous fiscal year 
gross profit for the year ended june  was million  an increase of million or over gross profit of million in fiscal gross profit was of net sales in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due primarily to the favorable effect of fixed costs allocated across a higher sales base 
this effect was partially offset by the reduction in shutdowns referred to above and increased profit sharing 
the decrease in average selling price referred to above did not have a commensurate effect on gross margin since most of the reduction was due to a change in product mix as the company has had increased sales of products with smaller die and package types  which have a lower average selling price but also lower costs

these increases were partially offset by lower legal expenses 
the dollar decrease in sg a expenses from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower compensation costs caused by lower profit sharing and by plant shutdowns of one week per month for the first three quarters in fiscal interest income decreased in fiscal to million and decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal the company s cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balance increased million during fiscal after spending million on repurchasing million shares of the company s common stock 
interest income fell in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to the decline in average interest rates earned on the company s cash investments which was partially offset by the interest earned on the million increase in cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balance

as a result of the completed portion of the examination  earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries were adjusted with the primary effect being an increase in domestic taxes paid and a decrease in the deferred tax liability account 
the irs results are included in fiscal financial statements and did not have a material impact upon them 
although the outcome of the tax audits is always uncertain  management believes that an adequate amount of taxes and related interest and penalty  if any  have been provided for any additional adjustment that may result from these years 
factors affecting future operating results except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this annual report on form k  including the statements in the following paragraphs  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including such factors  among others  as the timing  volume and pricing of new orders received and shipped during the quarter  timely ramp up of new facilities  the timely introduction of new processes and products  general conditions in the world economy and financial markets and other factors described below and in risks and competition located in the business section of this annual report on form k 
fiscal was better than the previous fiscal year  as the company reported solid growth over the previous fiscal year 
although the company has seen improvements across all of its major end markets during fiscal  its backlog of million as compared to million at the end of the previous fiscal year  while improving within fiscal  is still low by historic standards 
overall demand for the company s products is improving  however  the company s customers continue to be cautious in their ordering patterns 
the conditions external to the company remain largely unchanged  as general global economic and political conditions remain causes for concern 
consequently  although confidently and accurately forecasting short term results is difficult  when weighing all factors  including improving bookings  good positioning in diverse applications across many end markets  responsive lead times and good inventory mix positioning  and partially offsetting these positive factors with customer conservatism in response to sluggish economic news and geo political concerns  and some summer seasonal slowness  the company expects low single digit growth in sales and profits in the september quarter  which is in line with the company s normal summer quarter patterns 
estimates of future performance are uncertain  and past performance of the company may not be a good indicator of future performance due to factors affecting the company  its competitors  the semiconductor industry and the overall economy 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by rapid technological change  price erosion  cyclical market patterns  periodic oversupply conditions  occasional shortages of materials  capacity constraints  variations in manufacturing efficiencies and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 
furthermore  new product introductions and patent protection of existing products  as well as exposure related to patent infringement suits brought against the company are critical factors influencing future sales growth and sustained profitability 
the company s headquarters and a portion of its manufacturing facilities and research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located near major earthquake fault lines in california 
consequently  the company could be adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake 
although the company believes that it has the product lines  manufacturing facilities and technical and financial resources for its current operations  sales and profitability could be significantly affected by the above and other factors 
additionally  the company s common stock could be subject to significant price volatility should sales and or earnings fail to meet expectations of the investment community 
furthermore  stocks of high technology companies are subject to extreme price and volume fluctuations that are often unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
liquidity and capital resources at june   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled billion and working capital was also billion 
during fiscal the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for million 
after taking into consideration the cash used for these purchases  the company generated additional cash and short term investments of million 
during fiscal  the company generated million of cash from operating activities 
additionally  the company generated million in proceeds from common stock issued under employee stock option and stock purchase plans 
during fiscal  significant cash expenditures included net purchases of short term investments of million and million for the purchase of capital assets 
the company also paid million to repurchase million shares of its common stock 
the company paid million in cash dividends to stockholders representing per share per year compared to per share in fiscal in april  the company s board of directors declared an increase in the quarterly cash dividend to per share 
the payment of future dividends will be based on quarterly financial performance 
as of june   the company had no off balance sheet financing arrangements or activities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
the company s investments are managed by outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by the company 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting the company s investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
based upon the weighted average duration of the company s investments at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an unrealized loss in market value of the company s investments totaling approximately million 
however  because the company s debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized by the company due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
these investments are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains being included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
the company generally holds securities until maturity and carries the securities at fair market value 
the company has no debt and has historically satisfied its liquidity needs through cash generated from operations and the initial placement of equity securities 
given its strong financial condition and performance  the company believes that current capital resources and cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet its liquidity and capital expenditures requirements for the foreseeable future
