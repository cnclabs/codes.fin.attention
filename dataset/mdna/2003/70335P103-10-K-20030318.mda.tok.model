allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for losses on loans is based on management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio and reflects an amount considered by management to be its best estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio 
management considers a variety of factors when establishing the allowance  such as the impact of current economic conditions  diversification of the portfolios  delinquency statistics  results of loan review and related classifications  and historic loss rates 
in addition  certain individual loans which management has identified as problematic are specifically provided for  based upon an evaluation of the borrower s perceived ability to pay  the estimated adequacy of the underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
in addition  regulatory authorities  as an integral part of their examinations  periodically review the allowance for credit losses 
they may require additions to the allowance based upon their judgements about information available to them at the time of examination 
although provisions have been established and segmented by type of loan  based upon management s assessment of their differing inherent loss characteristics  the entire allowance for losses on loans is available to absorb further loan losses in any category 
management uses significant estimates to determine the allowance for credit losses 
since the allowance for credit losses is dependent  to a great extent  on conditions that may be beyond patriot s control  it is at least reasonably possible that management s estimate of the allowance for credit losses and actual results could differ in the near term 
patriot s total loans consist of four distinct portfolios 
each of which is monitored and analyzed seperately 
residential mortgage loans comprise of total loans 
the mortgage loan portfolio is seasoned as patriot has been in the mortgage lending business for many years and has sold substantially all new mortgage originations in the past three years 
the level of non performing assets in the mortgage portfolio decreased during in correlation to the overall mortgage portfolio 
the ratio of non performing assets to the total mortgage portfolio remained relatively stable from to management believes current levels can be attributed to the current recessionary phase of the credit cycle and a relatively low reference point in previous years balances 
patriot s mortgage loans are generally well collateralized and historically patriot has experienced minimal losses on these loans 
because of patriot s consistent history in mortgage lending and the long term nature of this portfolio  patriot predominately relies upon an internal regression analysis that uses historical data to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio 
consumer loans comprise of total loans and consist mostly of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit 
the consumer loan portfolio also is mature as patriot has been in the consumer lending business for many years 
as with mortgage lending patriot predominantly uses an internal regression analysis that uses historical data to estimate losses inherent in the portfolio 
commercial loans comprise of total loans 
patriot entered the commercial lending business in and has grown the portfolio into a substantial portion of total loans 
patriot uses historical data to prepare regression models to monitor trends of charge offs and recoveries and establish appropriate allowance levels 
the level of non performing assets in the commercial lending portfolio increased during patriot attributes recent recessionary conditions to the increase in non performing commercial assets 
patriot also closely monitors local economic and business trends relative to its commercial lending portfolio to estimate the effect those trends may have on potential losses 
patriot s commercial loan portfolio contains some loans that are substantially larger than the loans within other portfolios 
the potential loss associated with an individual loan could have a significant impact on the allowance and charge off levels at patriot 
therefore patriot closely monitors these loans and will specifically reserve for individual loans which exhibit weakness 
commercial leases comprise of total loans 
patriot entered the commercial leasing business in principally through the acquisition of kfl 
patriot s leasing portfolio has a short  approximately year life 
patriot performs an internal regression analysis on this portfolio using historical data including kfl data 
patriot also closely monitors regional and national economic business trends relative to its commercial leasing portfolio to estimate the effects those trend may have on potential losses 
during patriot experienced an increase in the level of chargeoffs in the commercial leasing portfolio 
patriot attributes the increase to a general weakness in the overall economy  relatively low previous year levels and higher delinquency trends in certain sectors of the portfolio 
in response to the elevated levels patriot enhanced it s policies  procedures and resources related to the credit administration for the leasing portfolio 
the result of these enhancements has been a steady improvement in charge offs  delinquencies and nonperforming leases in the latter part of patriot s percentage of loan loss reserves to total loans increased from 
in to in  which correlates to patriot s growth in its higher risk commercial loan and lease portfolios 
during  patriot s loan and lease portfolios decreased from  at december   to  the decrease in the loan portfolios is attributed to the run off of mortgage loans offset by growth in the commercial loan portfolio 
based on the growth in the commercial loan portfolio and the increased level of non performing loans and leases  management determined a provision of  was necessary to adequately address the losses inherent in patriot s loan and lease portfolios 
patriot believes that the allowance provides for known and inherent credit losses at december  the following table sets forth management s allocation of the allowance for credit losses at the dates indicated at december  percent of percent of percent of percent loans in percent of loans in percent of loans in allowance each allowance each allowance each to category to category to category total to total total to total total to total amount allowance loans amount allowance loans amount allowance loans in thousands commercial loans and leases    home equity and consumer residential mortgages total valuation allowances    at december  percent of percent of percent of loans in percent of loans in allowance each allowance each to category to category total to total total to total amount allowance loans amount allowance loans in thousands commercial loans and leases   home equity and consumer residential mortgages   total valuation allowances   cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents at december   were  compared to  at december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to temporary timing differences 
securities 
investment securities consist of us treasury and government agency securities  corporate debt and equity securities 
mortgage backed securities consist of securities generally issued by either the fhlmc  fnma or the government national mortgage association gnma 
collateralized mortgage obligations cmos consist of securities issued by the fhlmc  fnma or private issuers 
total investment and mortgage backed securities at december   were  compared to  at december  the increase in investment and mortgage backed securities is primarily due to  of investment purchases offset by  of principal repayments  sales  calls and maturities

other assets at december   were  compared to  at december  the decrease in other assets was primarily attributable to adjustments to patriot s deferred tax position related to unrealized gains on investments and mortgage backed securities available for sale 
deposits 
deposits are generally attracted from within patriot s primary market area through the offering of various deposit instruments  including checking accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts  certificates of deposit and retirement savings plans 
patriot also solicits brokered deposits from various sources 
total deposits at december   were  compared to  at december  of that decrease   was related to brokered deposits and  was related to higher costing retail certificates of deposits  replaced by a  increase in lower costing core deposits 
the reduction in brokered deposits was part of patriot s strategy to deleverage the balance sheet and reduce the dependence on brokered funding

patriot utilizes borrowings as a source of funds for its growth strategy and its asset liability management 
patriot is eligible to obtain advances from the fhlb upon the security of certain loan portfolios  mortgage backed securities  and investment securities  provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
fhlb advances are made pursuant to several different credit programs  each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
the maximum amount that the fhlb will advance to member institutions fluctuates from time to time in accordance with the policies of the fhlb 
patriot also uses repurchase agreements and federal funds as a funding source 
repurchase agreements are generally short term obligations collateralized by government agency and other securities 
federal funds are transactions that are typically between financial institutions and are short term unsecured borrowings 
during  fhlb short term and long term advances decreased  these borrowings were replaced with less expensive federal funds and customer repurchase agreements   and  respectively 
patriot also issued  of adjustable rate trust preferred securities and repurchased  of its fixed rate trust preferred issue 
there was a shift in the maturity of the borrowing portfolio 
short term borrowings increased  which was accomplished through the prepayment and maturity of fhlb advances 
this increase in short term borrowings better compliments certain adjustable rate loan and investment portfolios

critical accounting policies allowance for credit losses the allowance for losses on loans is based on management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio and reflects an amount considered by management to be its best estimate of known and inherent losses in the portfolio

management uses significant estimates to determine the allowance for credit losses 
since the allowance for credit losses is dependent  to a great extent  on conditions that may be beyond patriot s control  it is at least reasonably possible that management s estimate of the allowance for credit losses and actual results could differ in the near term 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets when in the judgement of management  it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not become available 
based on management s evaluation of the likelihood of realization  no valuation allowance has been established 
because the judgement about the level of future taxable income is dependent to a great extent on matters that may  at least in part be beyond patriot s control  it is at least reasonably possible that management s judgement about the need for a valuation allowance for deferred taxes could change in the near term 
reo and other repossessed property real estate owned is defined to include real estate patriot acquires through foreclosure 
reo is recorded on patriot s books at the lower of patriot s carrying value in the loan or the fair value of the property as of the date of transfer to reo 
any excess of the recorded investment in the loan over the fair market value is charged against patriot s loan loss reserve 
other repossessed property consists mostly of leased equipment returned to patriot at the end of the lease 
the off lease equipment is recorded on patriot s books at the lower of patriot s carrying value in the lease or the fair value of the equipment as of the date of transfer to other repossessed property 
any excess of the recorded investment in the lease over the fair market value is recorded as a loss 
additionally  valuation of reo and other repossessed property is dependent to a great extent on current economic  market and geographic conditions  and that may  at least in part be beyond patriot s control 
it is at least reasonably possible that management s estimates included in the valuation of reo and other repossessed property could change in the near term 
patriot s current judgement is that the valuation of reo and other repossessed property remains appropriate at december  liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
patriot s primary sources of funds are deposits  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments on investment and mortgage backed securities  fhlb advances  federal funds and repurchase agreements 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit inflows and loan and mortgage backed security prepayments are greatly influenced by economic conditions  general interest rates and competition 
therefore  patriot manages its balance sheet to provide adequate liquidity based upon various economic  interest rate and competitive assumptions and in light of profitability measures 
during   of liquidity was provided from the repayment and sale of mortgage backed securities 
additional liquidity of  was provided by the repayment of loans and  by core deposit growth 
these funds were invested in  of investment securities and  in commercial loans 
excess funds were used to repay  and  of branch certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit  respectively 
at december   patriot had outstanding loan commitments of  patriot anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its loan commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature in one year or less from december   totaled  based upon historical experience  patriot expects that substantially all of the maturing certificates of deposit will be retained at maturity  excluding wholesale certificates in the amount of  capital resources 
fdic regulations currently require companies to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of not less than of tier capital to total adjusted assets  a tier capital ratio of not less than of risk adjusted assets  and a minimum risk based total capital ratio based upon credit risk of not less than 
the fdic requires a minimum leverage capital requirement of for institutions rated composite under the camels rating system

the principal objective of patriot s interest rate risk management function is to evaluate the interest rate risk included in certain on and off balance sheet accounts  determine the level of risk appropriate given patriot s business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives  and manage the risk consistent with board approved guidelines 
through such management  patriot seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its net interest income to changes in interest rates 
patriot s board of directors has established an asset liability committee  which is responsible for reviewing its asset liability and interest rate position and making decisions involving asset liability considerations 
the asset liability committee meets regularly and reports trends and patriot s interest rate risk position to the board of directors 
the company uses three complementary methods to analyze and measure interest rate risk as part of the overall management of interest rate risk 
they are income simulation modeling  estimates of economic value of equity  and static gap analysis 
the combination of these three methods provides a reasonably comprehensive summary of the level of interest rate risk of the company when exposed to time factors and changes in interest rate environments 
income simulation modeling is utilized in measuring patriot s interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such as yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities  customer preferences and general market conditions 
through the use of income simulation modeling the company has calculated an estimate of net interest income for the year ending december   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments in existence at december  patriot has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon interest rates rising or falling in monthly increments rate ramps 
rate ramps assume that all interest rates increase or decrease in monthly increments evenly throughout the period modeled  with a floor of bp 
the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the year ending december  resulting from changes in interest rates 
rate ramp to interest rates change economic value of equity eve estimates the discounted present value of asset and liability cash flows 
discount rates are based upon market prices for comparable assets and liabilities 
as part of this evaluation the company has contracted with an independent consultant to perform an extensive core deposit analysis to appropriately estimate the discounted present value of the retail deposit franchise 
upward and downward rate shocks are used to measure volatility in relation to such interest rate movements in relation to an unchanged environment 
this method of measurement primarily evaluates the longer term repricing risks and options in the company s balance sheet 
the company has established policy limits for upward and downward rate shocks of of economic value of equity at risk for every basis points of interest rate shock 
additionally the company has a policy limit that the ratio of eve adjusted equity to eve adjusted assets will be maintained above a ratio 
the following table reflects the estimated economic value of equity at risk and the ratio of eve adjusted equity to eve adjusted assets at december   resulting from shocks to interest rates 
precent chaange eve equity rate shock from base eve assets base the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or re price within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or re pricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or re pricing within that time period 
the following table summarizes the amount of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which are anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  to re price or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
loan amounts reflect principal balances expected to be repaid and or re priced as a result of contractual amortization and anticipated prepayments of adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
estimated prepayment rates were applied to mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities based upon industry expectations 
core deposit decay rates have been estimated based upon a historical analysis of core deposit trends 
with the exceptions noted above  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to re pricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
the table sets forth the gap and cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets at december  days days days gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets as shown above  the company has a positive cumulative gap interest sensitive assets are greater than interest sensitive liabilities within the next year  which generally indicates that an increase in rates may lead to an increase in net interest income and a decrease in rates may lead to a decrease in net interest income 
interest sensitivity gap analysis measures whether assets or liabilities may reprice but does not capture the ability to reprice based on market conditions or the magnitude of the change in the repricing on assets or liabilities 
thus indications based on a positive or negative gap position need to be analyzed in conjunction with other interest rate risk management tools 
the company s management believes that the assumptions and combination of methods utilized in evaluating estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based
