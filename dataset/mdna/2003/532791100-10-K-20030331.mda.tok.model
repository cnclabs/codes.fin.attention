critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include accounts of all majority owned subsidiaries

revenue recognition the company s revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
if the payment amount received differs from the net realizable amount  an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in the period that these payment differences are determined 
the company reports revenues in its financial statements net of such adjustments 
the company s revenue recognition policy is consistent with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in financial statements sab for determining when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the requirements of sab that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the company operates  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
billing delays  ranging from several days to several weeks  can occur due to obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
the company performs analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable

the majority of the company s accounts and notes receivable are due from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process which involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts and notes receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
the company records bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts and notes receivable 
the company s proprietary management information systems are utilized to provide this data in order to assess bad debts 
in the event that collection results of existing accounts and notes receivable are not consistent with historical experience  there may be a need to establish an additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which may materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations
