business overview and discussion of known trends we develop  manufacture and market minimally invasive products that use radiofrequency energy to treat patients with solid cancerous or benign tumors 
in  we commercially launched our starburst xli family of disposable devices and significantly expanded our direct domestic sales organization and our international distribution network 
in  the xli family of disposable devices gained wide acceptance in the united states 
also in  we received regulatory approval from the fda to use our products to treat pain associated with bone tumors  greatly increasing the potential market for our products 

table of contents our products are sold in the united states through our direct sales force and internationally through distribution partners 
for the year ended december   sales in the united states accounted for of our total sales while sales in our international markets accounted for of our total sales 
we expect domestic sales to account for an increasing percentage the majority of total sales in future years due to our significant investment in our domestic sales force and because we expect only limited distribution of our premium priced starburst xli family of disposable needles in international markets for the next several years of the favorable market environment 
also  we expect that inventory reductions by our distributors in europe and japan  coupled with ongoing reimbursement issues  to limit sales growth in these regions  at least for however  our international operations will continue to represent a significant  if decreasing  portion of our revenue because of the high incidence of primary liver cancer in asian and european markets 
all of our revenue is derived from the sale of our disposable devices and radiofrequency generators 
for the year ended december   of our sales were derived from our disposable devices and were derived from the sale of our generators 
generator revenue grew in compared with  while disposable product revenue grew by only over the prior year period  primarily as a result of reduced disposable sales to our international distributors 
going forward  we will continue to focus on expanding our base of customer accounts and on increasing usage of our disposable products in our established accounts 
as a result  we expect revenue from the sale of our higher margin disposable devices to grow faster than revenue from the sale of our generators 
to date  essentially all of our revenue has come from products sold in the treatment of cancerous liver tumors 
in  however  we began to see some additional nominal revenue from the use of the rita system sold for the treatment of patients with metastatic bone tumors  a market we expect to grow in and beyond 
we are conducting research and clinical trials in other organs that may lead to additional sources of revenue in future years 
our manufacturing costs consist of raw materials  including generators and ancillary hardware components produced for us by third party suppliers  labor to produce our disposable devices and to inspect incoming  in process and finished goods  sterilization performed by an outside service provider and general overhead expenses 
gross margins are affected by production volumes  average selling prices  the sales mix of higher margin disposable devices versus generators and the mix of domestic direct sales versus international sales  which provide for standard distributor discounts 
our gross margin improved slightly in  increasing to from in  in response to the increasing percentages of domestic business in our sales mix and higher selling prices associated with our starburst xli family of disposable products  but was limited by charges associated with provisions for obsolete inventory 
we believe our charges for obsolete product to be essentially complete 
we expect gross margins to improve modestly in primarily as a result of improvements in our sales mix  the growing acceptance of our premium priced starburst xli line of disposable devices  and reduced inventory reserve requirements 
for the year ended december   of our operating expenses were related to research and development activities  down from in  with charges of million compared with million in the prior year period 
we expect expenses for product development and clinical trials to remain stable in  but legal expenses associated with our ongoing patent litigation are expected to significantly increase in  resulting in higher reported research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative activities represented of our operating expenses for the year  up from in  with charges of million compared with million in the prior year period 
this increase resulted from investments in the expansion of our domestic sales force and international distribution support activities as well as physician training and patient awareness programs 
also  because we experienced collection difficulties with several of our international distributors in  we increased our allowance for uncollectible accounts to of gross trade receivables as of december   from at december   further affecting growth in administrative expense 
we plan to continue to invest in market growth and business development and as a result expect selling  general and administrative expenses to represent an increasing percentage of our operating expenses in and beyond 
we also believe that the deterioration we experienced in international collections in will begin to stabilize in however  if we continue to experience difficulties with international collections we may need to further increase our allowance for uncollectible accounts in  and may identify specific accounts that would be required to post a letter of credit or pay in advance to minimize credit risk to the company 
our working capital decreased to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to cash used to fund operations  although operating cash requirements were notably mitigated by a reduced investment in accounts and notes receivable 
our capital expenditures for totaled million  down from million in  but we capitalized million in legal costs incurred in defense of our patent rights during  up from million in we do not expect significantly increased capital expenditures in the near term  but capitalized legal costs are expected to grow significantly in in connection with grants of stock options issued below fair market value to employees and options issued to non employees  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation as a component of stockholders equity 
this stock based compensation has been amortized as a charge to operations over the vesting periods of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million for the year ended december  as of december   all deferred stock based compensation recorded by the company has been fully amortized 
we do not expect in the future to issue options below their fair market value  and therefore expect no further expenses associated with stock based compensation 

table of contents we incurred net losses of million for the year ended december  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
due to the high costs associated with continued research and development programs  expanded clinical research programs and increased sales and marketing efforts  we expect to incur net losses for the full year  but losses should diminish through the first three quarters of the year  and we expect to be modestly profitable around the end of or the first part of profitability beyond this time frame will depend on our success in expanding product usage in our current market and in developing new markets 
to the extent current or new markets do not materialize in accordance with our expectations  our sales and profitability could be lower than expected and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
we are currently involved in patent proceedings and may become a party to additional patent or product liability proceedings 
the costs of such lawsuits or proceedings are expected to be material and could affect our earnings  financial position and cash flows 
an adverse outcome in a patent lawsuit could require us to cease sales of affected products or to pay royalties and or license fees  which could harm our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we believe the following accounting policies have been critical in the preparation of our financial statements because they involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe users of our financial statements  including potential and current investors  will find an explanation of these policies important to understanding our discussions of financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
a more extensive review of all accounting policies considered to be significant in the preparation of our financial statements appears in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our customers  who are primarily private companies in the united states  europe and asia 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and past transaction credit worthiness and generally require no collateral 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on our assessment of the likelihood of collection of individual accounts 
this allowance may prove to be inadequate if collections fail to meet current estimates  which could occur as a result of general economic conditions or the insolvency of specific key customers 
inventories and inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
we maintain a reserve for obsolete  unmarketable or excess product based on assumptions regarding future demand or market conditions 
we may be required to make further provisions to our reserve if market conditions prove less favorable than our current expectations  or if the introduction of new products renders existing products obsolete 
litigation costs in august  we filed a complaint in the united states district court for the northern district of california against radiotherapeutics corporation 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k  the complaint alleges that radiotherapeutics radiofrequency ablation products infringe six of our patents 
the litigation costs thereby incurred in defense of our patents  approximately million as of december   have been capitalized 
amortization of this asset has been matched to the remaining life of the six patents  approximately years as of december  although we expect a favorable outcome in this matter  an unsuccessful outcome would require an immediate charge to earnings of any remaining unamortized costs 
it is probable that additional litigation costs will be capitalized in future periods 
contingencies in addition to routine legal matters arising in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in several matters relating to the defense of our patent rights or alleged infringement of the patent rights of others 
while we believe that the outcome of our outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows  such matters involve complex questions of fact and law and could involve significant costs and the diversion of resources to defend 
additionally  the results of litigation are inherently uncertain  and an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible 
we record loss contingencies in the financial statements when it is determined that we have incurred a loss that is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable  in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
as of december   we have not recorded any liabilities for legal contingencies because we do not believe we have probable potential losses 
this assessment could change in the future based on changes in the status of these matters and or their ultimate outcomes 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon receipt of a customer purchase order and subsequent product shipment provided no significant obligations remain and collection of the associated receivable is deemed reasonably assured 
this policy is applied to all of our customers  including our distributors  who have no price protection and no return rights on product purchased 
should changes in conditions or the status of obligations cause us to determine that our criteria are not met for certain 
table of contents future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we do not generally engage in bundling transactions that would call for the deferral of revenue 
through december   all of our billings have been denominated in us dollars  although we expect relatively minor billings in foreign currencies in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and respectively years ended december  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses loss from operations interest and other income expense  net net loss years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  an increase of from million in we experienced growth in our domestic market  with domestic sales increasing by over  reflecting increased physician awareness of our technology and increased coverage from our domestic sales group  which was larger in than in sales in our international markets decreased by  as our global distributor network reduced inventories and coped with weak economic conditions 
for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total revenue  compared to in sales of our disposable products grew by and generator sales increased by compared with results 
also  for the year ended december   disposable sales accounted for of total revenue  compared to in results in in our domestic business were constrained by supply issues relating to accessory infusion pumps used with our starburst xli line of disposable products 
we believe that these issues have been addressed and should have no further significant impact on revenues  but in the event that supply issues recur  our revenues and results could be negatively impacted 
our generator placements increased compared with  reflecting both the expansion of our customer base and the introduction of newer technology to our existing customers 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in costs associated with increased unit shipments of generators and other hardware components of the rita system increased by million over  but lower unit shipments of disposables resulted in a million reduction in costs associated with these products 
also  cost of goods sold was affected by charges for obsolete inventory  which totaled million for  but were only nominal in further  amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  was included in cost of goods sold  down from  in excluding the effect of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation  our gross margin was in compared with in  reflecting the higher percentage of sales accounted for by relatively low margin hardware sales and the increase in charges for obsolete inventory 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to reductions in new product development costs and clinical trial costs  as the large development expenses associated with the introduction of our starburst xli product line in were not matched by similarly scaled programs in also  amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from  in we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development  and accelerating legal costs associated with defense of patent litigation matters may result in substantial increases in our research and development expenses in and beyond 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our domestic sales organization  which resulted in higher compensation and travel expenses in also  we made additional investments in market development and public relations  and recognized higher administrative expenses relating to provisions to our allowance for uncollectible accounts 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from  in we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will stabilize for  as further significant growth in selling expenses is not expected for at 
table of contents least twelve months  and because we believe that future provisions to our allowance for uncollectible accounts will not be as large as those made in interest income was million for the year ended december   down from million in  because average daily cash balances fell during as we utilized cash for operations 
interest expense for was  down from  in  as we carried no bank debt in and recognized only nominal amounts of interest expense associated with capital lease payments 
years ended december  and for the year ended december   sales totaled million  an increase of from million in we experienced growth in both domestic and international markets  with domestic sales increasing by and international sales increasing by over the previous year 
for the year ended december   domestic sales represented of total revenue  as compared to in sales of our disposable products grew by and generator sales decreased by compared with results 
also  for the year ended december   disposable sales accounted for of total revenue  up from in higher unit shipments of generators and disposables resulted from increased physician awareness of our technology  a major expansion of our domestic sales force  increased geographical representation through the appointment of new international distributors and the launch of our starburst xli family of disposable devices 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million as compared to million in the growth in cost of goods sold was attributable primarily to higher material  labor  and overhead costs associated with increased unit shipments 
included in cost of goods sold was amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  down from  in excluding the effect of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation  gross margins improved to in from in the improvement was due to higher average selling prices of our disposable devices  related to the launch of our premium priced five and seven centimeter starburst xli electrodes  and to the increasing proportions of domestic business and disposable products in our sales mix 
gross margins also benefited from manufacturing efficiencies attained through higher volume production of our disposable devices 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in this increase was due to expenses associated with the development of our next generation technology  increased clinical program spending  and increased spending related to the growth and protection of our patent portfolio 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from  in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million in the increase was primarily attributable to the major expansion of our domestic sales organization  additional investments in market development and public relations  and administrative expenses relating to provisions to our allowance for uncollectible accounts 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  for the year  down from million in interest income was million for the years ended december  and although average daily cash balances were higher in than in  lower market interest rates resulted in no growth in interest income 
interest expense for was  down from  in  as a result of repayment during the year of bank debt  all of which had been eliminated by june liquidity and capital resources prior to august  we financed our operations principally through private placements of convertible preferred stock  raising approximately million net of expenses 
on august   we completed our initial public offering of million common shares at a price of per share  raising approximately million net of expenses 
all outstanding convertible preferred shares were converted to common shares at that time 
to a lesser extent  we also financed our operations through equipment financing and other loans see below  which were fully repaid as of december  as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of marketable securities  million in investments intended for resale and million of working capital 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million principally due to our net loss of million  offset by non cash charges of million  including depreciation and amortization  provisions to reserves for uncollectible accounts and inventory  and amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
approximately million in cash was provided by changes in working capital accounts  particularly reduced accounts receivable balances that resulted from the shift to domestic accounts  which are generally collected much faster than international accounts 
our investing activities for the year were limited to the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of million and capitalization of certain patent defense litigation costs in the amount of million 
maturities and net sales of investment instruments provided million in cash in support of operations 
financing activities for the year provided million in cash  including million from the issuance of common stock offset by million in capital lease payments 

table of contents for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million principally due to our net loss and increases in accounts receivable and inventory resulting from higher revenues  a lengthened collection cycle and the introduction of our starburst xli product line 
our investing activities for the year were limited to the purchase of property and equipment in the amount of million and net purchases or sales of short term investment instruments 
net cash used by financing activities for the year was million  as payments on bank debt and lease obligations exceeded the proceeds received from issuance of common stock 
we have  from time to time  financed equipment through capital and operating leases 
as of december   we had no future minimum payments due under capital leases  future minimum payments due under operating leases were as follows total of future minimum operating lease payments our capital requirements depend on numerous factors including our research and development expenditures  expenses related to selling  general and administrative operations and working capital to support business growth 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  based on our cash burn rate of approximately million per month in  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  including cash raised in the securities offering described below  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us or  if available  that such financing will be available on terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
recent development private placement of securities in january of  the company issued  shares of unregistered common stock at a price of per share  netting approximately million after issuance fees and expenses 
the issuance was deemed to be exempt from registration under the securities act in reliance upon section thereof as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering 
on february   the company s registration statement on form s  which registered the shares of common stock sold to sf capital partners ltd  riverview group  llc  baystar capital ii  lp  and baystar international ii  lp  was declared effective by the sec 
income taxes as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  available to offset future regular taxable income 
we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets  however  because realization of favorable tax assets in future returns is very uncertain 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  and the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire between and  if not utilized 
the tax reform act of limits the use of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in certain situations where changes occur in the stock ownership of the company  and our utilization of our carryforwards could be restricted

factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company s business and prospects 
due to our dependence on the rita system  failure to achieve market acceptance in a timely manner could harm our business 
because all of our revenue comes from the sale of the rita system  our financial performance will depend upon physician adoption and patient awareness of this system 
if we are unable to convince physicians to use the rita system  we may not be able to generate revenues because we do not have alternative products 
we are currently involved in a patent interference action and a patent opposition action involving radiotherapeutics corporation  a division of boston scientific corporation and if we do not prevail in these actions  we may be unable to sell the rita system 
in july  the united states patent and trademark office declared an interference involving us  which was provoked by radiotherapeutics corporation  a competitor of ours and a division of boston scientific corporation  in which the validity of a patent claim previously issued to us was called into question 
the claims at issue in the interference cover a radiofrequency ablation device having an array of deployable electrodes effective  in a deployed state  to define a tissue ablation volume 
in february  the patent and trademark office issued a decision on preliminary motions filed in the patent interference proceeding 
the decision found that one of the claims in our united states patent no 
 claim no 
is invalid 
on september   the patent and trademark office board of patent appeals and interferences issued a final decision finding that radiotherapeutics had failed to establish priority of invention over rita s established invention date and  therefore  were not themselves entitled to any patent claims in the interference 
it also affirmed the earlier preliminary decision  described above  regarding claim no 
on october   radiotherapeutics filed an action in the united states district court for the northern district of california seeking to reverse the patent and trademark office board of patent appeals priority decision  to affirm its decision regarding claim no 
 and to initiate a new interference between certain issued patent claims licensed to radiotherapeutics and certain of rita s patent claims 
final determination of these patent interference proceedings may take several years 
if the united states district court reverses the decision of the patent and trademark office board of patent appeals as to radiotherapeutics entitlement to priority  and we were found to infringe radiotherapeutics patent claims and were unable to obtain a license to use the relevant patent or successfully modify our disposable device  we could be unable to sell our system and our business could suffer 
if the district court affirms the patent and trademark board s decision regarding claim no 
or if radiotherapeutics prevails on its new interference  we could lose one or more of our issued patent claims 

table of contents in march  radiotherapeutics filed an opposition to our european patent no 
before the european patent office 
this patent covers the curvature of the array at the tip of our disposable devices 
in this opposition  the validity of our issued patent is being questioned 
in february  the european patent office determined that we were entitled to european patent no 
both parties have appealed this ruling and a final decision is not expected in this proceeding for several years 
if we do not prevail in the opposition proceeding  we could lose our only currently issued patent in europe 
we have been sued for patent infringement by boston scientific corporation and two of its divisions  unemed corporation and their respective licensors 
if we do not prevail in these lawsuits or any that may be brought in the future  we could be prevented from selling our products and our business could suffer 
on april   radiotherapeutics corporation and scimed life systems  inc two divisions of boston scientific corporation  the board of regents of the university of nebraska  and unemed corporation filed a complaint against us alleging that certain of our products infringe a patent assigned to the university of nebraska and licensed by unemed and radiotherapeutics and a patent owned by scimed 
radiotherapeutics filed a first amended complaint on october  adding to the litigation a second patent assigned to the university of nebraska and licensed to radiotherapeutics 
also  in a separate action initiated on july   boston scientific corporation and the university of kansas filed a complaint against us alleging that certain of our products infringe a patent assigned to the university of kansas and licensed by boston scientific 
in addition  we are aware of the existence of patents held by competitors in our market  which could result in additional patent lawsuits against us 
in the event that we do not prevail in the boston scientific lawsuits or if we are subject to additional patent litigation and we are found to infringe  we could be prevented from selling our products unless we could obtain a license or were able to redesign our products to avoid infringement 
if we were unable to obtain a license or successfully redesign our products  we may be prevented from selling our products and our business could suffer 
we have a history of losses  anticipate significant increases in our operating expenses over the next several years and may never achieve profitability 
although we anticipate that our operating expenses will begin to stabilize in absolute dollars over the next several quarters  to become profitable we must continue to increase our sales and manage our operating expenses 
if sales do not continue to grow  we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
in particular  we incurred net losses of million in  million in  million in and million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in addition  we have incurred significant expenses related to disputes concerning our intellectual property position  including a lawsuit filed by us against radiotherapeutics corporation and anticipate that these expenses will continue to be significant while these actions are ongoing 
if our current patent actions are not resolved in the near term  the timeframe to achieve profitability may be delayed 
because we face significant competition from companies with greater resources than we have  we may be unable to compete effectively 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants 
we compete directly with two companies in the domestic and international markets radiotherapeutics corporation  a division of boston scientific corporation  and radionics  inc  a division of tyco healthcare  which is a division of tyco international 
boston scientific corporation and tyco international are publicly traded companies with substantially greater resources than we have 
both radiotherapeutics and radionics sell products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
we are also aware of several companies in international markets which sell products that compete directly with ours 
these companies are affecting our international market share and may erode that share in the future 
in addition  one of these companies  berchtold corporation  has recently received fda clearance for using radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
alternative therapies could prove to be superior to the rita system  and physician adoption could be negatively affected 
in addition to competing against other companies offering products that use radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue  we also compete against companies developing  manufacturing and marketing alternative therapies that address both cancerous and benign tumors 
if these alternative therapies prove to offer treatment options that are perceived to be superior to our system  physician adoption of our products could be negatively affected and our revenues could decline 

table of contents we currently lack long term data regarding the safety and efficacy of our products and may find that long term data does not support our short term clinical results or that further short or long term studies do not support the safety and efficacy of our products in various applications 
our products are supported by clinical follow up data in published clinical reports or scientific presentations covering periods from five months to three years after radiofrequency ablation 
if additional studies in liver cancer or in other applications fail to confirm or demonstrate the effectiveness of our products  our sales could decline 
if longer term patient follow up or clinical studies indicate that our procedures cause unexpected  serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects  we could be subject to significant liability 
further  because some of our data has been produced in studies that were retrospective  not randomized or included small patient populations and because  in certain circumstances  we rely on clinical data developed by independent third party physicians  our clinical data may not be reproduced in wider patient populations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the rights of others  we may lose market share to our competitors and our business could suffer 
our success depends significantly on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our products  and yet we may be unable to do so 
a number of companies in our market  as well as universities and research institutions  have issued patents and have filed patent applications that relate to the use of radiofrequency energy to ablate soft tissue 
that could result in additional lawsuits against us 
our pending united states and foreign patent applications may not issue or may issue and be subsequently successfully challenged by others 
in addition  our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products that are not currently protected by issued patents 
both the patent application process and the process of managing patent disputes can be time consuming and expensive 
in the event a competitor infringes on our patent or other intellectual property rights  enforcing those rights may be difficult and time consuming 
even if successful  litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against challenge could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention 
we may not have sufficient resources to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend our patents against a challenge 
in addition  confidentiality agreements executed by our employees  consultants and advisors may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights we could lose market share to our competitors and our business could suffer 
our dependence on international revenues  which account for a significant portion of our revenues  could harm our business 
because our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to grow product sales in international markets  we are exposed to risks specific to business operations outside the united states 
these risks include the challenge of managing international sales without direct access to the end customer  the risk of inventory build up by our distributors which could negatively impact sales in future periods for example  our distributor in japan has built up a significant inventory of product in anticipation of the receipt of product and reimbursement approvals  obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our devices in some foreign markets  the burden of complying with complex and changing foreign regulatory requirements  longer accounts receivable collection time  significant currency fluctuations  which could cause our distributors to reduce the number of products they purchase from us because the cost of our products to them could increase relative to the price they could charge their customers  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some foreign countries  and contractual provisions governed by foreign laws 
we are substantially dependent on two distributors in our international markets  and if we lose either distributor or if either distributor significantly reduces its product demand  our international and total revenues could decline 
we are substantially dependent on a limited number of significant distributors in our international markets  and if we lose these distributors and fail to attract additional distributors  our international revenues could decline

it accounted for percent of our international revenues in and percent of our international revenues in mdh mdh forniture ospedaliere  our distributor in italy  accounted for percent of our international revenues for and percent of our international revenues for because international revenues accounted for percent of our total revenues for and these two distributors represented percent of that total  the loss of either distributor or a significant decrease in unit purchases by either distributor could cause revenues to decline substantially 
if we are unable to attract additional international distributors  our international revenues may not grow 
our relationships with third party distributors could negatively affect our sales 
we sell our products in international markets through third party distributors over whom we have limited control  and  if they fail to adequately support our products  our sales could decline 
if our distributors or we terminate our existing agreements  finding companies to replace them could be an expensive and time consuming process and sales could decrease during any transition period 
we are aware that some of our international distributors have built up inventory of our products 
as a result  future sales to these distributors could be negatively impacted 
in addition  while these distributors have no price protection and no right of return relating to purchased products  if we permit the return of any of these products  we will have to adjust our revenues relating to these products which may also impact our revenue recognition policy on future distributor sales 
in recent quarters we have significantly increased our allowance for uncollectible accounts to address the risk associated with longer collection periods that have arisen principally with our european distributors 
if difficult economic conditions persist  and our collection experience worsens as a result  we may need to further adjust our allowance for uncollectible accounts in future periods  thereby reducing profits 
if customers in markets outside the united states experience difficulty obtaining reimbursement for procedures using our products  international sales could decline 
certain of the markets outside the united states in which we sell our products require that specific reimbursement codes be obtained before reimbursement for procedures using our products can be approved 
as a result  in countries where specific reimbursement codes are strictly required and have not yet been issued  reimbursement has been denied on that basis 
for example  itx  our distributor in japan  is seeking to obtain reimbursement coverage in japan  but to date has not yet received this approval 
if we are unable to either obtain the required reimbursement codes or develop an effective strategy to resolve the reimbursement issue  physicians may be unwilling to purchase our products which could negatively impact our international revenues 
if third party payors do not reimburse health care providers for use of the rita system  purchases could be delayed and our revenues could decline 
physicians  hospitals and other health care providers may be reluctant to purchase our products if they do not receive substantial reimbursement for the cost of the procedures using our products from third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and private health insurance plans 
even though in february of we were successful in establishing a new cpt code related to liver procedures with the american medical association  a payor still may not reimburse adequately for the procedure or product 
we are aware of cases in which reimbursement for liver procedures using our system has been denied 
in addition  there is no specific reimbursement code for radiofrequency ablation of tumors in other organs 
further  we believe the advent of fixed payment schedules has made it difficult to receive reimbursement for disposable products  even if the use of these products improves clinical outcomes 
fixed payment schedules typically permit reimbursement for a procedure rather than a device 
if physicians believe that our system will add cost to a procedure but will not add sufficient offsetting economic or clinical benefits  physician adoption could be slowed 
in addition  reimbursement levels are highest when our products are used in an inpatient setting 
if there is a trend toward the use of our products on an outpatient basis  reimbursement levels could be lower and physician use could decline 
we depend on key employees in a competitive market for skilled personnel and without additional employees  we cannot grow or achieve profitability 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management  operations and research and development staff  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
our future success will depend in part on the continued service of these individuals and our ability to identify  hire and retain additional personnel  including sales and marketing staff 
the market for qualified management personnel in northern california  where our offices are located  is competitive and is expected to continue to be competitive 
because the environment for good personnel is so competitive  costs related to compensation may increase significantly 
if we are unable to attract and retain both the management team and key personnel we need to support and grow our business  our business will suffer 

table of contents we may be subject to costly and time consuming product liability actions 
we manufacture medical devices that are used on patients in both minimally invasive and open surgical procedures and  as a result  we may be subject to product liability lawsuits 
to date  we have not been subject to a product liability claim  however  any product liability claim brought against us  with or without merit  could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future 
in addition  we could have to pay any amount awarded by a court in excess of policy limits 
finally  even a meritless or unsuccessful product liability claim could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could result in the diversion of management s attention from managing our core business 
any failure in our physician training efforts could result in lower than expected product sales 
it is critical to our sales effort to train a sufficient number of physicians and to instruct them properly in the procedures that utilize our products 
we have established formal physician training programs and rely on physicians to devote adequate time to understanding how and when our products should be used 
if physicians are not properly trained  they may misuse or ineffectively use our products 
such use may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes  patient injury and related liability or negative publicity that could have an adverse effect on our product sales 
we may incur significant costs related to a class action lawsuit due to the likely volatility of our stock 
our stock price may fluctuate for a number of reasons including failure of the public market to support the valuation established in our initial public offering  our ability to successfully commercialize our products  announcements regarding patent litigation or the issuance of patents to us or our competitors  quarterly fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of technological or competitive developments  regulatory developments regarding us or our competitors  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  and general market conditions  particularly for companies with small market capitalizations 
securities class action litigation is often brought against a company after a period of volatility in the market price of its stock 
if our future quarterly operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the price of our common stock would likely decline 
stock price fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low 
any securities litigation claims brought against us could result in substantial expense and divert management s attention from our core business 
we have limited experience manufacturing our disposable devices in substantial quantities  and if we are unable to hire sufficient additional personnel or to purchase additional equipment or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand  our business could suffer 
to be successful  we must manufacture our products in substantial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements at acceptable costs 
if we do not succeed in manufacturing quantities of our disposable devices that meet customer demand  we could lose customers and our business could suffer 
at the present time  we have limited high volume manufacturing experience 
our manufacturing operations are currently focused on the in house assembly of our disposable devices 
as we increase our manufacturing volume and the number of product designs for our disposable devices  the complexity of our manufacturing processes will increase 
because our manufacturing operations are primarily dependent upon manual assembly  if demand for our system increases we will need to hire additional personnel and may need to purchase additional equipment 
if we are unable to sufficiently staff and equip our manufacturing operations or are otherwise unable to meet customer demand for our products  our business could suffer 
we are dependent on one supplier as the only source of a component that we use in our disposable devices  and any disruption in the supply of this component could negatively affect our business 

table of contents to date  there has been only one supplier available to provide us with a component that we include in our disposable devices 
recently  we have identified a second supplier  but we have not yet fully qualified them 
however  a disruption in the supply of this component is still possible and could negatively affect revenues 
if we were unable to remedy a disruption in supply of this component within twelve months  we could be required to redesign the handle of our disposable devices  which could divert engineering resources from other projects or add to product costs 
in addition  a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities may require clearance prior to our marketing a product containing new materials 
this clearance process may take a substantial period of time  and we may be unable to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for any new material to be used in our products on a timely basis  if at all 
this could also create supply disruptions that could negatively affect our business 
we are dependent on two suppliers as our only sources of an accessory device used in conjunction with our starburst xli line of disposable devices  and any disruption in the supply of these devices could negatively affect our revenues 
until december of  we had only one supplier available to provide us with accessory infusion pumps used in conjunction with our starburst xli line of disposable devices 
during the quarters ended september  and december   we experienced shortages in the supply of accessory infusion pumps 
in december of  we qualified a new accessory infusion pump from our existing supplier for which we now have approval from ul and conditional approval from tuv for use in the united states and europe 
also in december of  we qualified a second supplier of an accessory infusion pump  although we have not yet shipped this product to our customers commercially 
although we were able to remedy this supply disruption  future disruptions in the supply of this component are still possible and  in that event  our business could suffer through lower revenues or higher costs 
additionally  we have limited experience with both the primary and alternative pump and if either pump fails to perform as desired  revenues could be negatively affected 
we are dependent on third party contractors for the supply of our generators  and any failure to deliver generators to us could result in lower than expected revenues 
we are dependent on two third party suppliers to produce our generators 
while we have agreements with both of these suppliers  any delay in shipments of generators to us could result in our failure to ship generators to customers and could negatively affect revenues 
complying with the fda and other domestic and international regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
we are subject to a host of federal  state  local and international regulations regarding the manufacture and marketing of our products 
in particular  our failure to comply with fda regulations could result in  among other things  seizures or recalls of our products  an injunction  substantial fines and or criminal charges against our employees and us 
the fda s medical device reporting regulations require us to report any incident in which our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury  or in which our products malfunctioned in a way that would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction recurred 
sales of our products outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary from country to country 
the time required to obtain approvals from foreign countries may be longer than that required for fda approval or clearance  and requirements for foreign licensing may differ from fda requirements 
for example  some of our newer products have not received approval in japan 
any failure to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our new products in foreign countries could negatively affect revenues 
product introductions or modifications may be delayed or canceled as a result of the fda regulatory process  which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
unless we are exempt  we must obtain the appropriate fda approval or clearance before we can sell a new medical device in the united states 
obtaining this approval or clearance can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
to date  all of our products have received clearances from the fda through premarket notification under section k of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
however  if the fda requires us to submit a new premarket notification under section k for modifications to our existing products  or if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we now expect  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled which could cause our revenues to be below expectations 
the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain premarket approval process 
in addition  modifications to medical device products cleared via the k process may require a new k submission 
we have made minor modifications to our system 
using the guidelines established by the fda  we have determined that some of these modifications do not require us to file new k submissions 
if the fda disagrees with our determinations  we may not be able to sell the rita system until the fda has cleared new k submissions for these modifications  or they may require us to recall previously sold products 
in addition  we intend to request additional label indications  such as approvals or clearances for the ablation of tumors in additional organs  including lung  uterus and breast  for our current products 
the fda may either deny 
table of contents these requests outright  require additional extensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of approval or clearance 
therefore  obtaining necessary approvals or clearances for these additional applications could be an expensive and lengthy process 
in addition  in the course of the fda process leading to clearance or approval for a new indication  fda may request an advisory panel meeting or meetings to discuss the clinical data  the appropriate study design or other criteria for clearance or approval 
in the event that the advisory panel advises fda that the clinical data are inadequate or the study design or other criteria are inappropriate  and fda concurs  the fda clearance or approval process could be lengthened and anticipated revenues from that new indication would be delayed 
we may need to raise additional capital in the future resulting in dilution to our stockholders 
we may need to raise additional funds for our business operations and to execute our business strategy 
we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights that are senior to holders of common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
any additional financing may not be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our executive officers and directors own a large percentage of our voting stock and could exert significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval 
because our executive officers and directors  and their respective affiliates  own approximately percent of our outstanding common stock as of december   these stockholders may  as a practical matter  be able to exert significant influence over matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combinations 
this concentration of voting stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition or other change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws  delaware law and our stockholder rights plan contain provisions that may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition or other change of control that a stockholder may consider favorable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk at december  is related to our investment portfolio  we have no interest rate sensitive borrowings as of that date 
fixed rate investments and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted from changes in interest rates 
floating rate investments may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall  and floating rate borrowings  should we acquire any  will lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations  and our interest expense may be above our expectations 
further  we may suffer losses in investment principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the united states government and its agencies and in high quality corporate issuers 
the average contractual duration of our investments in was less than one year 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
all of our sales and purchases have historically been denominated in united states dollars 
in the future  we may begin to make sales in other currencies such as the euro 
we believe we currently have no significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and that such risk in the future will be minimal
