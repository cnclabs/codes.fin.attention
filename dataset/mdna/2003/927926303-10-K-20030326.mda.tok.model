item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the corporation for the three years ended december  and the related notes thereto  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in canada 
differences from united states gaap are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations summary the corporation s net loss was million per share  compared to the net loss of million per share 
the improvement in is a result of reduced holding costs at the hycroft mine  lower depreciation and amortization costs  and a non recurring charge of million for settlement of a law suit  net of related million cost recoveries in  offset by an expense to increase the provision for reclamation at hycroft 
gold production and revenue the hycroft mine is on care and maintenance 
mining activities were suspended at hycroft in and  as expected  gold production has declined steadily since that time 
currently  solution is being circulated over the heap leach pads to enhance evaporation 
as the solution is circulated over the heap leach pads  it is passed through a carbon plant  where small amounts of gold are adsorbed onto activated carbon 
subsequently the gold is stripped from the carbon  refined and sold 
effective at the beginning of fiscal  gold production was considered incidental to the activities at the hycroft mine and reporting the associated sales proceeds as revenue was no longer warranted 
accordingly  gold sales proceeds of approximately million in have been accounted for as an offset to exploration  property evaluation and holding costs 
gold revenues in therefore were nil  compared to million in the gold revenues were a result of  ounces of gold production 
gold production in was  ounces compared to  ounces in  gold revenues of million were down  as expected  from million in the decline in gold revenues in reflects the decrease in gold production from of this million reduction in revenue  substantially the entire difference resulted from lower gold production in slightly lower gold prices in per ounce average vs 
average in accounted for approximately  of the million reduction in revenue 
costs and expenses as discussed above  effective at the beginning of fiscal  gold production was considered incidental to the activities at the hycroft mine  accordingly gold production costs  which approximately offset the million proceeds received from gold sales  are no longer recorded as production costs  but are accounted for as exploration  property evaluation and holding costs 
recorded production costs are therefore nil 
production costs at the hycroft mine decreased to million per ounce in from million per ounce in the decrease in costs was primarily due to the progressive reduction of leach solution volume processed at the hycroft mine  with related reductions in manpower  in consumption of materials and supplies  and in electrical power 
the increase in per ounce costs was due to the reduction in gold production 
depreciation  depletion and amortization costs at hycroft were million in compared to million in and million in this downward trend reflects the fact that a significant portion of the hycroft property plant and equipment has been sold  and a substantial portion of the remaining equipment has been fully depreciated 
consistent with bureau of land management  nevada state office mandated procedures  in the corporation commissioned a third party comprehensive review of the estimated reclamation costs at the hycroft mine 
based on this review  the corporation increased by million its obligation accrued to december  no such adjustments were made in and exploration  property evaluation and holding costs were million in  compared to million in holding costs at hycroft comprise substantially all of the million exploration  property evaluation and holding costs in  and it accounts for million of the costs  amayapampa accounted for the remaining million in the hycroft cost reductions resulted principally from manpower reductions and generally lower levels of activity at the hycroft site 
net holding costs at amayapampa are negligible as a result of the collection of royalties accruing from the sale in of the capa circa mine 
exploration  property evaluation and holding costs of million in compared to million in of these amounts  hycroft accounted for million in  and a similar amount in holding costs for amayapampa were million  compared to million in this reduction is mainly a result of manpower reductions effected in april  and resulting reduced office and administration costs in bolivia 
corporate administration and investor relations costs were million in  slightly higher than the million in the increase reflects investor relations and business development programs  consistent with its increased level of gold project acquisition and private placement financings in corporate administration and investor relations costs were million in  similar to the million incurred in  as expected 
the corporation incurred  in interest expense in  in connection with its convertible debenture issuance  which closed on march  the debentures had an annual interest rate of and were converted automatically  pursuant to their terms  on september  see consolidated financial statements note 
interest expense of  was lower than million incurred in because the corporation repaid most of its debt in the first quarter of net gains from disposals of hycroft equipment in totalled  compared to net gains of million in net gains from disposals of assets include a gain of  from the disposal of canadian exploration claims 
net gains from disposal in were  a gain on the sale of marketable securities of million was realized in  no similar gain was realized or realizable in in  the corporation recorded a non recurring provision of million for the settlement of the usf g lawsuit as discussed in consolidated financial statements note there was no similar provision in the corporation received from golden phoenix minerals  inc gpmi  the current owner of the mineral ridge mine   common shares in consideration for benefits gpmi received as a direct result of the corporation s facilitation of the usf g settlement 
these shares had a fair value of  when received 
in addition  the final settlement amount for the usf g lawsuit was approximately  less than provided for 
an  write down to fair value has been made to reflect an estimated  fair value of the gpmi shares 
management regularly reviews the carrying values of its long lived assets 
in  based on these reviews  management wrote down the amayapampa property in bolivia by million  and certain hycroft assets by million 
no similar write downs were deemed necessary in and the million write down of the amayapampa project in bolivia in resulted from a carrying value review wherein the previously assumed long term gold price of per ounce  as assumed in  was reduced to per ounce in  consistent with industry practice 
the per ounce change in the gold price assumption resulted in a reduction of approximately million in expected future cash flows from the amayapampa project 
accordingly an impairment loss was recognized 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the corporation had million in working capital compared to a working capital deficiency of million as of december  the principal component of working capital is cash 
the corporation s consolidated cash balance at december  was million  an increase of million from the end of this increase resulted from the two private placement financings  which provided million in net proceeds see consolidated financial statements note 
in addition  the corporation raised million from the sale of hycroft mining equipment and canadian mining claims 
the corporation used million as partial consideration in acquiring gold projects see consolidated financial statements note  million to settle the usf g lawsuit see consolidated financial statements note  and million was used in operating activities 
in the corporation raised no cash from financings  used million to repay debt  made no acquisitions of property  plant and equipment  raised from the sale of idle mining equipment and used million in operating activities 
subsequent to december   the corporation completed a private placement equity unit financing for net proceeds of million see consolidated financial statements note 
cash consumed in operating activities in was million  compared to million in the million improvement in is comprised mainly of the reduction in reclamation and mine closure costs million compared to million in and respectively 
the remainder of the cash improvement reflects the corporation s successful cost reduction efforts  offset by a reduction in gold revenues 
the corporation made no capital expenditures in  and no material capital expenditures in outlook management has estimated that the corporation s million of working capital as of december   will be adequate to meet its corporate administrative and property obligations for the coming year 
in  the corporation is committed to approximately  in capital expenditures relating to exploration and land holding costs for those projects acquired in the corporation expects that emphasis on gold project acquisition will continue in the future 
in support of this strategy  the corporation has available  in addition to its current working capital  approximately million net proceeds  from a financing completed subsequent to december  the corporation does not currently generate operating cash flows 
subject to sustained higher gold prices  management expects that it can generate revenues and cash flows  in the future  from its portfolio of gold projects by several means  including  but not limited to options or leases to third parties  joint venture arrangements with other gold producers  outright sale for cash and or royalties 
the corporation does not have adequate cash to begin development of any its projects  and would need to seek additional financing in order to construct and operate a gold mine 
although the corporation has been successful in obtaining such financing in the past  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so in the future 
the corporation has provided a surety bond in the amount of million to ensure reclamation obligations under an approved reclamation plan at the hycroft mine 
the bureau of land management  nevada state office  has requested an additional bond of  for interim fluid management and it is probable that the state will request that the corporation increase the total surety bond amount to an estimated million  inclusive of the interim fluid management bond 
furthermore  the corporation has been requested to pledge collateral in order to provide this surety bond 
the amount and the nature of the collateral will be subject to negotiation 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will be successful in providing acceptable collateral and thus posting the surety bond
