these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict  therefore  actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in any such forward looking statements 
investors should carefully review the risk factors set forth in other reports or documents we file with the sec  including forms q  k and k 
some of the other risks and uncertainties that should be considered include  but are not limited to  the following international  national and local general economic and market conditions  the size and growth of the overall athletic footwear and apparel markets  the size of our competitors  intense competition among designers  marketers  distributors and sellers of athletic footwear and apparel for consumers and endorsers  market acceptance of our training shoe line  market acceptance of new limited edition product  market acceptance of non performance product in europe  market acceptance of national geographic footwear  market acceptance of royal elastics footwear  demographic changes  changes in consumer preferences  popularity of particular designs  categories of products  and sports  seasonal and geographic demand for our products  the size  timing and mix of purchases of our products  fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results  including  without limitation  the fact that advance futures orders may not be indicative of future revenues due to the changing mix of futures and at once orders  potential cancellation of future orders  our ability to continue  manage or forecast our growth and inventories  new product development and commercialization  the ability to secure and protect trademarks  patents  and other intellectual property  including  without limitation  our ability to successfully defend against trademark cancellation claims made by swiss army brands  inc  difficulties in implementing  operating and maintaining our increasingly complex information systems and controls  concentration of production in china  potential earthquake disruption due to the location of our domestic warehouse and headquarters  performance and reliability of products  customer service  adverse publicity  the loss of significant customers or suppliers  dependence on distributors  business disruptions  increased costs of freight and transportation to meet delivery deadlines  changes in business strategy or development plans  general risks associated with doing business outside the united states  including  without limitation  import duties  tariffs  quotas and political and economic instability  the effects of terrorist actions on business activities  customer orders and cancellations  and the united states and international governments responses to these terrorist actions  changes in government regulations  liability and other claims asserted against us  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and other factors referenced or incorporated by reference in this report and other reports 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors can arise and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 

table of contents investors should also be aware that while we do communicate  from time to time  with securities analysts  it is against our policy to disclose to them any material non public information or other confidential commercial information 
accordingly  investors should not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report 
furthermore  we have a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others 
thus  to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain any projections  forecasts or opinions  such reports are not our responsibility 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record the estimated income reductions from estimated sales returns and allowances 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances 
in the past  actual returns and allowances have not exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase in the period in which we made such determination 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers  as well as an assessment of the overall conditions at retail 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were 
table of contents to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record a charge to cost of sales 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of certain items in the consolidated statements of earnings relative to revenues 
year ended december  revenues cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses interest income  net earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings compared to total revenues increased to  in from  in this increase was attributable to an increase in the volume of footwear sold partially offset by a decrease in the average underlying wholesale price per pair

royal elastics and national geographic brands sales were  in domestic and  in we believe that the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased domestic sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday seasons 
we present full line offerings for the easter and back to school seasons  for delivery during the first and third quarters  respectively  but not for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  and higher  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  increased to in from in gross profit margins increased primarily due to achievement of target costing objectives and higher levels of at once business than in the prior year 
overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the increase in the amounts for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily the result of increases in advertising  payroll and related expenses approximately half of which related to payroll due to the royal elastics and national geographic brands  bonus expense for an employee incentive program and development expenses resulting from an increase in product development activities 
overall net interest income was  of revenues in compared to  of revenues in  a decrease of  or

the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  was due primarily to these expenses increasing at a slower rate than revenues during net interest income was  of revenues in compared to  of revenues in  a decrease of  or 
this decrease in net interest income was the result of decreased rates earned on commercial paper investments partially offset by higher average balances on commercial paper investments 
also  during we recorded interest expense related to the  and internal revenue service examinations

net earnings increased to  or per share diluted earnings per share in from  or 
per share diluted earnings per share in liquidity and capital resources we experienced a net cash inflow of approximately   and  from our operating activities during  and  respectively

cash provided by operating activities for the year ended as compared to  decreased due primarily to differences in the amounts of changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by an increase in net earnings 

table of contents we had a net outflow of cash from our investing activities during and due to the net purchase of property  plant and equipment  and for due to a cash payment for the acquisition of royal elastics and a cash payment for interest in a licensing agreement 
in and  the net cash provided by operating activities was used for the purchase of treasury stock and to pay cash dividends  partially offset by proceeds from stock options exercised 
also  in  cash provided by operating activities was used for the repayment of borrowings under bank lines of credit and subordinated debentures 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to any borrowings under our lines of credit facilities 
in addition  depending on our future growth rate  additional funds may be required by operating activities 
finally  at december   approximately  of foreign subsidiary earnings which are not considered indefinitely invested may eventually be remitted to the parent company as circumstances warrant 
upon receipt of these funds  we will use approximately  in cash to pay income taxes previously accrued on these foreign subsidiary earnings 
our intention is to repatriate earnings of foreign operations as cash needs and other circumstances require 
no other material capital commitments exist at december  with continued use of our revolving credit facility as discussed below  we believe our present and currently anticipated sources of capital are sufficient to sustain our anticipated capital needs for the remainder of in october  we announced the completion of our september million stock repurchase program and a new authorization by the board of directors for us to repurchase through december up to an additional million of our class a common stock from time to time on the open market  as market conditions warrant 
we adopted this program because we believe repurchasing our shares can be a good use of excess cash depending on our array of alternatives 
currently  we have made purchases under all stock repurchase programs from august through february  the day prior to the filing of the form k of  shares at an aggregate cost totaling approximately  in june  we were notified by counsel representing the trustee appointed to oversee the liquidation of assets of a previous customer of ours  which filed for bankruptcy protection in  that they are seeking reimbursement of all payments made to us during the day period prior to the bankruptcy filing 
the aggregate amount of these payments  which the trustee s counsel is claiming to be preferential transfers  is approximately  while the trustee is seeking the court s permission to add a further  in claimed preferential transfers 
we believe these payments were received in the ordinary course of business and that we have meritorious defenses against the trustee s claims 
in november  the trustee filed suit against us and other creditors to recover payments made to us during the days prior to the customer s bankruptcy filing 
we continue to believe that we have a meritorious ordinary course of business defense against these claims and will assert that defense in detail at the appropriate time in the litigation 
no provision for this claim has been made in our financial statements as of december  in july  we signed a new agreement with a bank whereby we may borrow  in the form of an unsecured revolving credit facility  up to  the unused portion of this credit facility  which includes letters of credit and bankers acceptances  was  at december  this facility currently expires in july the credit facility provides for interest to be paid at the prime rate less or  at our discretion and with certain restrictions  other market based rates 
we pay a commitment fee of of the unused line for availability of the credit facility 
we must meet certain restrictive financial covenants as agreed upon in the facility 

table of contents our european offices have agreements with a bank whereby they can borrow up to  in the form of unsecured revolving credit facilities 
the unused portion of these credit facilities was  at december  these facilities are made available until terminated by either party 
there was no debt at december  and december  excluding outstanding letters of credit of  and  at december  and  respectively 
our working capital increased  to  at december  from  at december  we have historically maintained higher levels of inventory relative to sales compared to our competitors because we do not ship directly to our major domestic customers from our foreign contract manufacturers to the same extent as our larger competitors  which would reduce inventory levels and increase inventory turns  and unlike many of our competitors  we designate certain shoes as core products whereby we commit to our retail customers that we will carry core products from season to season and  therefore  we attempt to maintain open stock positions on our core products in our mira loma  california distribution center to meet at once orders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential change in an instrument s value caused by  for example  fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
our primary market risk exposure is the risk of unfavorable movements in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro 
monitoring and managing these risks is a continual process carried out by senior management  which reviews and approves our risk management policies 
market risk is managed based on an ongoing assessment of trends in foreign exchange rates and economic developments  giving consideration to possible effects on both total return and reported earnings 
foreign exchange rate risk sales denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which are primarily sales to customers in europe  expose us to market risk from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates between the us dollar and the foreign currency 
our historical primary risk exposures have been from changes in the rates between the us dollar and the euro 
this trend is expected to continue 
to fix the us dollar amount we will receive on sales denominated in euros  we enter into forward exchange contracts to sell the foreign currency denominated in that currency 
the extent to which forward exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to our management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation 
the use of derivative financial instruments allows us to reduce our exposure to the risk that the eventual dollar net cash inflow resulting from the sale of products to foreign customers will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
the foreign exchange contracts are designated for firmly committed or forecasted sales 
these contracts are generally expected to occur in less than one year 
gains and losses of foreign exchange contracts that are designated for forecasted transactions are recognized as the exchange rates change 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for us dollars at maturity  at rates agreed at the inception of the contracts 
the counter party to derivative 
table of contents transactions is a major financial institution with investment grade or better credit rating  however  we are exposed to credit risk with this institution 
the credit risk is limited to the unrealized gains in such contracts should this counter party fail to perform as contracted 
the table below provides information as of december  and about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts by currency 
the information is presented in us dollars december  europe euro notional amount fair value average contractual exchange rate 
euro we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position relating to these foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a change in currency rates would not have had a material effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inflation we believe that distributors of footwear in the higher priced end of the footwear market  including ours  are able to adjust their prices in response to an increase in direct and general and administrative expenses  without a significant loss in sales 
accordingly  to date  inflation and changing prices have not had a material adverse effect on our revenues or earnings
