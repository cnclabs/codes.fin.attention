critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and such differences may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following significant accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the useful lives of the assets are based upon management s expectations for the period of time that the asset will be used for the generation of revenue 
management periodically reviews the assets for changes in circumstances that may impact their useful lives 
impairment of long lived assets 
management periodically reviews property and equipment for impairment using historical cash flows as well as current estimates of future cash flows 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions that are subject to a high degree of judgment 
in addition  management periodically assesses the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets which requires assumptions regarding the future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the assets 
if these assumptions change in the future  management may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
income taxes 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred assets will not be realized 
management has considered all available evidence both positive and negative  including the company s historical operating results  estimates of future taxable income and ongoing feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance 
this could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
other estimates 
management is required to make judgments and or estimates in the determination of several of the accruals that are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that the following accruals are subject to a higher degree of judgment 
management uses estimates in the determination of the required accruals for general liability  workers compensation and health insurance 
these estimates are based upon a detailed examination of historical and industry claims experience 
the claim experience may change in the future and may require management to revise these accruals 
the company is periodically involved in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
management is required to assess the probability of any adverse judgments as well as the potential ranges of any losses 
management determines the required accruals after a careful review of the facts of each legal action 
the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in these matters 
management continually reassesses its assumptions and judgments and makes adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report

actual results may differ materially 
quick service 
the quick service segment of the restaurant industry is a very mature and competitive segment  which is dominated by several national chains 
market share is gained through national media campaigns promoting specific sandwiches  usually at a discounted price 
the national chains extend marketing efforts to include nationwide premiums and movie tie ins 
during fiscal  fierce price competition in the quick service segment negatively affected the company s burger king results 
to date in fiscal  the price competition that prevailed in the latter part of fiscal has continued 
if quick service restaurants continue to rely on price discounting to increase customer traffic  the company will either have to continue competing on price or concede market share 
either circumstance would adversely affect the company s results 
the company should benefit from capital improvements made in fiscal and fiscal specifically  the transformational initiatives and the early renewal program remodeling should enhance the image of the company s restaurants and therefore have a positive impact on sales 
additionally  the company believes that its acquisition of burger king restaurants in the grand rapids  michigan  market should continue to bolster the performance of its burger king division in fiscal through the improvement of the grand rapids profit margins 
full service 
the full service segment of the restaurant industry is also mature and competitive 
this segment has a few national companies that utilize national media efficiently 
this segment also has numerous regional and local chains that provide service and products comparable to the national chains but which cannot support significant marketing campaigns 
the company operates three restaurant concepts that compete in the full service segment 
during fiscal  the company experienced strong results in its chili s division 
these results were achieved by the application of the company s disciplined operating systems and successful marketing and menu strategies 
the company also believes that the results in its chili s division were aided by effective product and marketing support from the franchisor 
during fiscal  the company intends to continue to emphasize the operational and marketing initiatives that contributed to the success of its chili s division in fiscal and therefore expects steady financial results in fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced a slight deterioration in its italian dining division s profitability

the company believes that the results in this division were negatively affected by competitive intrusion in the company s markets and limitations in the company s ability to efficiently market its grady s american grill restaurants 
during fiscal  the company sold or closed restaurants 
the company will continue to consider opportunities to divest under performing or non strategic restaurants in fiscal the company expects the grady s american grill division s operating performance to continue to decline during fiscal liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the company s principal sources and uses of cash dollars in thousands fiscal year ended october  october  october  net cash provided by operating activities    cash flows from investing activities acquisition of business  net of cash  purchase of property and equipment    purchase of other assets   proceeds from the sale of assets   other  net cash flow from financing activities borrowings repayment of long term debt  net    purchase of common stock   loan financing fees repayment of capitalized lease the company requires capital principally for building or acquiring new restaurants  replacing equipment and remodeling existing restaurants

the company had a net repayment of  under its revolving credit agreement during fiscal as of october   the company s revolving credit agreement had an additional  available for future borrowings 
the company s average borrowing rate on october  was 
the revolving credit agreement is subject to certain restrictive covenants that require the company  among other things  to achieve agreed upon levels of cash flow 
under the revolving credit agreement the company s funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio could not exceed and its fixed charge coverage ratio could not be less than on october  the company was in compliance with these requirements with a funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio of and a fixed charge coverage ratio of 
the company s primary cash requirements in fiscal will be capital expenditures in connection with the opening of new restaurants  remodeling of existing restaurants  maintenance expenditures  and the reduction of debt under the company s debt agreements 
during fiscal  the company anticipates opening one or two new quick service restaurants and two or three full service restaurants 
the company also plans to replace five existing quick service buildings with new buildings at the same locations 
the actual amount of the company s cash requirements for capital expenditures depends in part on the number of new restaurants opened  whether the company owns or leases new units and the actual expense related to remodeling and maintenance of existing units 
while the company s capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to range from  to  if the company has alternative uses or needs for its cash  the company believes it could reduce such planned expenditures without affecting its business plan 
the company has debt service requirements of approximately  in fiscal  consisting primarily of the principal payments required under the mortgage facility 
the company anticipates that its cash flow from operations  together with the  available under its revolving credit agreement as of october   will provide sufficient funds for its operating  capital expenditure  debt service and other requirements through the end of fiscal as of october   the company had a financing package totaling  consisting of a  revolving credit agreement the bank facility and a  mortgage facility the mortgage facility  as described below 
the mortgage facility currently includes separate mortgage notes  with initial terms of either or years 
the notes have fixed rates of interest of either or 
the notes require equal monthly interest and principal payments 
the mortgage notes are collateralized by a first mortgage deed of trust and security agreement on the real estate  improvements and equipment on of the company s chili s restaurants nine of which the company mortgaged its leasehold interest and of the company s burger king restaurants three of which the company mortgaged its leasehold interest 
the mortgage notes contain  among other provisions  certain restrictive covenants including maintenance of a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio for the financed properties 
on june   the company refinanced its bank facility with a  revolving credit agreement with jp morgan chase bank  as agent  and four other banks 
the bank facility is collateralized by the stock of certain subsidiaries of the company  certain interests in the company s franchise agreements with brinker and burger king corporation and substantially all of the company s personal property not pledged in the mortgage facility 
the bank facility contains restrictive covenants including maintenance of certain prescribed debt and fixed charge coverage ratios  limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  limitations on consolidated capital expenditures  cross default provisions with other material agreements  restrictions on the payment of dividends other than stock dividends and limitations on the purchase or redemption of shares of the company s capital stock 
the bank facility provides for borrowings at the adjusted libor rate plus a contractual spread which is as follows ratio of funded debt to cash flow libor margin greater than or equal to less than x but greater than or equal to less than x but greater than or equal to x less than x the bank facility also contains covenants requiring maintenance of funded debt to cash flow and fixed charge coverage ratios as follows maximum funded debt to cash flow ratio covenant fiscal q q q fiscal q through q q fiscal q through q q fiscal q through q thereafter fixed charge coverage ratio the company s funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio is required to be by the end of fiscal the company s funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio on october  was 
to maintain at least the required ratio of the company plans to continue to dispose of under performing restaurants and use the proceeds to reduce debt 
should the company not be able to sell under performing restaurants the company believes it could reduce its capital spending 
its principal opportunities to reduce capital spending would be to scale back its new unit development and or its planned remodel budget 
the company could also increase consolidated cash flow through reductions in general and administrative expenses 
if the company were not successful in meeting the required funded debt to consolidated cash flow ratio it would experience an event of default 
the company would then need to seek waivers from its lenders or amendments to the covenants 
the company has long term contractual obligations primarily in the form of lease and debt obligations

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provides updated guidance concerning the recognition and measurement of an impairment loss for certain types of long lived assets  expands the scope of a discontinued operation to include a component of an entity and eliminates the current exemption to consolidation when control over a subsidiary is likely to be temporary 
the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material affect on future results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
it nullifies the guidance in emerging issues task force  which recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date an entity committed itself to an exit plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company plans on early adopting the provisions of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material affect on future results

however  the company has early adopted the disclosure provisions for the current fiscal year and included this information in note to the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the company s operations during the past several years 
increases in labor  food  and other operating costs could adversely affect the company s operations 
in the past  however  the company generally has been able to modify its operating procedures or increase menu prices to substantially offset increases in its operating costs 
many of the company s employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws and various laws that allow for credits to that wage 
although the company has been able to and will continue to attempt to pass along increases in labor costs through food and beverage price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increases can be reflected in its prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by customers without diminishing  to some degree  customer spending at the company s restaurants
