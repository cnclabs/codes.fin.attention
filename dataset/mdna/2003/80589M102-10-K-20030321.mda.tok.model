competition electric operations in south carolina  electric restructuring efforts remain stalled  and consideration of electric restructuring legislation is unlikely in further  while several companies have announced their intent to site merchant generating plants in the company s service territory  economic events  environmental concerns and other factors have slowed those efforts 
in view of the potential for deregulation  the company has continued efforts to renew franchise agreements with municipalities within its current service area 
effective october  sce g secured a year franchise to provide the city of columbia  south carolina  with electric and natural gas services 
columbia is one of the largest cities in sce g s service area 
previously  sce g reached franchise agreements with the cities of north charleston franchise expires in  charleston franchise expires in and numerous other municipalities 
in addition  in may sce g signed an electric supply contract with north carolina electric membership corporation to supply mw in each of and and mw annually in through these energy sales are recallable for sce g s native load  if necessary 
at the federal level  energy legislation passed both houses of congress in  though significant differences between the house and senate versions were not reconciled before the legislative session adjourned 
some of the more stringent provisions of this legislation would have required  among other things  that one percent of the electric energy sold by retail electric suppliers  beginning in  escalating to ten percent in  be generated from renewable energy resources 
renewable energy resources  as defined in some versions of the legislation  would have excluded hydroelectric generation 
substantial penalties would have been levied for failure to comply 
electric cooperatives and municipal utilities would have been exempt from these requirements 
the company expects similar legislation will be introduced in congress in the company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted  and if it is  the conditions it would impose on utilities 
in june implementation of gridsouth transco llc gridsouth was suspended pending the issuance and evaluation of new ferc directives 
in july ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr on standard market design which proposes sweeping changes to the country s existing regulatory framework governing transmission  open access and energy markets and will attempt  in large measure  to standardize the national energy market 
while it is anticipated that significant change to the nopr may occur and that implementation  presently scheduled for september  may be delayed  any rules standardizing the markets may have a significant impact on sce g s access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on sce g s marketing of power outside its service territory 
the company is currently evaluating this nopr to determine what effect it will have on sce g s operations 
additional directives from ferc are expected in gas distribution the company has secured franchise agreements with several municipalities within its current service areas to provide natural gas services 
see previous discussion at electric operations 
natural gas competes with electricity  propane and heating oil to serve the heating and  to a lesser extent  the other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers 
this competition is generally based on price and convenience 
large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel  such as propane or fuel oil 
natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price 
as a result  any significant disparity between supply and demand  either of natural gas or of alternate fuels  and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors  will affect the price and impact the company s ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers on a monthly basis 
gas transmission in september scg pipeline  inc scg received approval from ferc to acquire an interest in an existing pipeline and to build a pipeline from elba island  georgia to jasper county  south carolina 
when operational  scg will provide interstate transportation services for natural gas to markets in southeastern georgia and south carolina 
scg will transport natural gas from interconnections with southern natural at port wentworth  georgia  and from an import terminal owned by southern lng  inc at elba island  near savannah  georgia 
the endpoint of scg s pipeline will be at the site of the natural gas fired generating station that sce g is building in jasper county  south carolina 
construction of the pipeline is expected to begin in the first half of  with completion expected in the fall of scpc supplies natural gas to sce g  for its resale to gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs 
gas transmission also sells natural gas to large commercial and industrial customers in south carolina  and it faces the same competitive pressures as gas distribution for these classes of customers 
retail gas marketing in april georgia s natural gas consumer s relief act of the act became law 
the act attempts to resolve many of the consumer protection and other public policy issues surrounding georgia s natural gas market with the following significant provisions o creates a regulated provider selected through a bidding process to serve low income and high credit risk customers  o allows georgia s non profit electric membership corporations emcs to establish natural gas affiliates that may seek certification as marketers of natural gas  o establishes new service quality standards and assignment of interstate assets  and o grants to the gpsc the authority to temporarily regulate rates if more than of customers in a specific area of the state are served by three or fewer marketers 
in june scana energy won gpsc approval to become the state s regulated provider 
in this capacity  scana energy serves low income customers generally at below market rates  subsidized by georgia s universal service fund  and extends service generally at above market rates to high credit risk customers who have been denied service by other marketers 
scana energy began serving these customers on september   and at december   approximately  customers were being served by scana energy under this program 
in june the fourth largest marketer in georgia s natural gas market declared bankruptcy 
in july a subsidiary of southern company completed its purchase of the bankrupt marketer s georgia operations 
southern company  through another subsidiary  sells electricity to approximately two million customers in georgia 
in addition  affiliates of two emcs have been certified by the gpsc as gas marketers 
these new entrants to georgia s natural gas market may help stabilize the market  although it is unclear what impact these entrants may have on the company s competitive position 
at december  the three largest marketers which include scana energy served approximately of georgia s natural gas market 
scana energy and scana s other natural gas distribution  transmission and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments  including futures contracts and options  to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a part of this risk management process  at any given time a portion of scana s projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract 
this factor and others eg  the level of bad debts experienced are  in the aggregate  used to establish retail pricing levels at scana energy 
as a result of the regulatory actions discussed above and other downward pricing pressures inherent in the competitive market  scana energy may be unable to sustain its current level of customers and or pricing  thereby reducing expected margins and profitability 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirements arise primarily from the operational needs of scana subsidiaries  the company s construction program  the investments of scana s subsidiaries and payment of dividends 
the ability of scana s regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment  as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas  will depend upon their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms 
scana s regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers 
rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs 
as customer growth and inflation occur and the regulated subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs  the company expects to seek increases in rates 
the company s future financial position and results of operations will be affected by the regulated subsidiaries ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief  if requested 
in january the scpsc issued an order granting sce g an increase in retail electric rates of which is designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately million based on a test year calculation 
the scpsc authorized a return on common equity of 
the new rates were effective for service rendered on and after february  as a part of the order  the scpsc extended through its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for sce g s cope generating station 
under the plan  sce g may increase depreciation of its cope generating station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates  not to exceed million annually  without the approval of the scpsc 
any unused portion of the million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year 
the estimated primary cash requirements for and the actual primary cash requirements for  excluding requirements for non nuclear fuel purchases  short term borrowings and dividends  are as follows millions of dollars property additions and construction expenditures  net of afc nuclear fuel expenditures investments maturing obligations  redemptions and sinking and purchase fund requirements  total   approximately of total cash requirements was provided from internal sources in as compared to in the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  are summarized as follows contractual cash obligations less than after december  total year years years years millions of dollars long term and short term debt including interest    preferred stock sinking funds capital leases operating leases other commercial commitments   included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases 
many of these forward contracts for natural gas purchases include customary make whole or default provisions  but are not considered to be take or pay contracts 
certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses  therefore  the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates 
at september   other commercial commitments included amounts for a take and pay natural gas contract with a year term beginning in that contract was terminated in december  and amounts due under the contract totaling billion over the year term have been removed from contractual cash obligations 
see note e of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to these commercial commitments  the company is party to certain new york mercantile exchange nymex futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements through december  are funded in cash 
these derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until such time as the anticipated sales transactions occur 
in addition to the above contractual cash commitments  the company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees 
the pension plan has been adequately funded  with no contributions having been required since cash benefit payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan have been approximately million per year in recent years  and similar payments are expected in the future 
the company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness 
sales of additional equity securities may also occur 
the company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
financing limits and related matters the company s issuance of various securities  including long term and short term debt  is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and the sec 
the following describes the financing programs currently utilized by the company 
scana corporation scana has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities 
while issuance of these securities requires customary approvals discussed above  the indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued 
at december  scana had million of unused lines of credit  comprised of million of committed lines  expiring in  and million of uncommitted lines 
there were no amounts outstanding under scana s lines of credit at december  and on january  scana obtained an additional million committed line of credit  expiring in on january   scana renegotiated an existing million uncommitted line of credit to allow sce g to share in this line of credit 
the company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
these swap agreements provide for the company to pay variable and receive fixed interest payments  and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments 
the company may terminate a swap agreement  and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge

other information sce g placed in service a million gas turbine generator project in aiken county  south carolina in june two combined cycle turbines burn natural gas to produce mw of new electric generation and use exhaust heat to replace coal fired steam that powers two existing mw turbines at the urquhart generating station 
in may sce g began construction of an mw generation facility in jasper county  south carolina  to supply electricity to its south carolina customers 
the facility will include three natural gas combustion turbine generators and one steam turbine generator 
the million facility is expected to begin commercial operation in mid scg will transport natural gas to the facility 
in october ferc mandated that sce g reinforce its lake murray dam in order to comply with new federal safety standards and maintain the lake in case of an extreme earthquake 
construction for the project and related activities  which began in the third quarter of  is expected to cost approximately million and be completed in costs incurred through december  totaled approximately million 
in sce g entered into an agreement with the south carolina transportation infrastructure bank the bank and the south carolina department of transportation scdot that allows sce g to borrow funds from the bank to construct a roadbed for scdot in connection with the above lake murray dam remediation project 
the loan agreement provides for interest free borrowings for costs incurred not to exceed million  with such borrowings being repaid over ten years from the initial borrowing 
at december  sce g had not yet borrowed under the agreement 
environmental matters electric operations the clean air act amendments of caa required electric utilities to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides nox substantially by the year the company remains in compliance with these requirements 
in the epa required the state of south carolina  among other states  to modify its state implementation plan sip to address the issue of nox pollution 
the state s sip requires additional emissions reductions in and beyond 
further  the epa has indicated that it will propose regulations by december for stricter limits on mercury and other toxic pollutants generated by coal fired plants 
to comply with these state and federal regulations  sce g and genco expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million over the period to retrofit existing facilities  with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately million per year 
to meet compliance requirements for the years through  the company anticipates additional capital expenditures of approximately million 
the epa has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry  and the department of justice has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the caa 
prior to the suits  those utilities had received requests for information under section of the caa and were issued notices of violation 
the basis for these suits is the assertion by the epa that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly best available control technology bact 
the company and sce g have received and responded to section requests for information related to canadys  wateree and williams stations 
the regulations under the caa provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications  including an exemption for routine repair  replacement or maintenance 
the company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the epa s requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair  replacement and maintenance 
the regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth 
it is possible that the epa will commence enforcement actions against sce g  and the epa has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to  per day for each violation 
the epa also could seek installation of bact or equivalent at the three plants 
the company believes that any assertions relative to the company s and sce g s compliance with the caa would be without merit 
however  if successful  such assertions could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
the clean water act  as amended  provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges 
under this act  compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program 
discharge permits have been issued for all and renewed for nearly all of sce g s and genco s generating units 
concurrent with renewal of these permits  the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling thermal discharges and strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams 
the company is developing compliance plans for these initiatives 
congress is expected to consider further amendments to the clean water act in such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones  the implementation of technology based standards for main condenser cooling water including intake and discharge structures and toxicity based standards 
these provisions  if passed  could have a material impact on the results of operations and cash flows of sce g and genco 
gas distribution the company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates 
amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates 
deferred amounts for sce g  net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters 
o sce g owns a decommissioned mgp site in the calhoun park area of charleston  south carolina 
the site is currently being remediated for benzene contamination in the intermediate aquifer on surrounding properties 
sce g anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed in  with certain monitoring and retreatment activities continuing until as of december   sce g has spent approximately million to remediate the calhoun park site 
total remediation costs are estimated to be million 
o sce g owns three other decommissioned mgp sites in south carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals 
two of these sites are currently being remediated under work plans approved by dhec 
sce g is continuing to investigate the remaining site and is monitoring the nature and extent of residual contamination 
sce g anticipates that major remediation activities for these three sites will be completed before sce g has spent approximately million related to these sites  and expects to incur an additional million 
in addition  psnc energy owns  or has owned  all or portions of seven sites in north carolina on which mgps were formerly operated 
intrusive investigation including drilling  sampling and analysis has begun at two sites and the remaining sites have been evaluated using historical records and observations of current site conditions 
these evaluations have revealed that mgp residuals are present or suspected at several of the sites 
psnc energy s actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors  such as actual site conditions  third party claims and recoveries from other prps 
in september an allocation agreement was reached relieving psnc energy of liability for two of the seven sites 
psnc energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of million  which reflects the estimated remaining liability at december  amounts incurred to date that have not been recovered through gas rates are approximately million 
management believes that all mgp cleanup costs incurred will be recoverable through gas rates 
regulatory matters state regulated public utilities are allowed to record as assets some costs that would be expensed by other enterprises 
if deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment occur  the company may no longer be eligible to apply this accounting treatment and may be required to eliminate such regulatory assets from its balance sheet 
although the potential effects of deregulation cannot be determined at present  discontinuation of the accounting treatment could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the period the write off would be recorded 
it is expected that cash flows and the financial position of the company would not be materially affected by the discontinuation of the accounting treatment 
the company reported approximately million and million of regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  including amounts recorded for deferred income tax assets and liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively  on its balance sheet at december  the company s generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market 
if market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs  the company could be required to write down its investment in these assets 
the company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and  if they are  the extent to which they would adversely affect the company s results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded 
as of december  the company s net investment in fossil and hydro and nuclear generation assets was approximately  million and million  respectively 
south carolina electric gas company sce g is subject to the jurisdiction of the scpsc as to retail electric and gas rates  service  accounting  issuance of securities other than short term borrowings and other matters 
electric in january the scpsc issued an order granting sce g an increase in retail electric rates of which is designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately million based on a test year calculation 
the scpsc authorized a return on common equity of 
the new rates were effective for service rendered on and after february  as a part of the order  the scpsc extended through its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for sce g s cope generating station 
under the plan  sce g may increase depreciation of its cope generating station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates  not to exceed million annually  without the approval of the scpsc 
any unused portion of the million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year 
on december  the scpsc issued an order approving sce g s request to capitalize the cost of fuel consumed in the production of test power for the gas turbines installed at urquhart generating station in as a result  sce g transferred approximately million from fuel used in electric generation to electric utility plant 
in may the scpsc issued an order approving sce g s request to increase the fuel component of rates charged to electric customers from cents per kwh to cents per kwh 
the increase reflects higher fuel costs projected for the period may through april the increase also provided continued recovery for under collected actual fuel costs through april  including short term purchased power costs necessitated by outages at two of sce g s base load generating plants in winter the new rates were effective as of the first billing cycle in may in january in conjunction with the approval of the retail rate increase  the scpsc approved sce g s request to reduce the fuel component to cents per kwh 
gas sce g s rates are established using a cost of gas component approved by the scpsc which may be modified periodically to reflect changes in the price of natural gas purchased by sce g 
sce g s cost of gas component in effect during the years ended december  and was as follows rate per therm effective date rate per therm effective date

per therm to 
per therm  effective with the first billing cycle in march in the scpsc issued an order approving sce g s request to recover through a billing surcharge to its gas customers the costs of environmental cleanup at the sites of former mgps 
the billing surcharge is subject to annual review and provides for the recovery of substantially all actual and projected site assessment and cleanup costs and environmental claims settlements for sce g s gas operations that had previously been deferred 
in october  as a result of the annual review  the scpsc reaffirmed sce g s billing surcharge of cents per therm  which is intended to provide for the recovery  prior to the end of the year  of the balance remaining at december  of million 
transit on october  sce g transferred its transit system to the city of columbia  south carolina city 
as part of the transfer agreement  sce g will pay the city million over eight years in exchange for a year electric and gas franchise  has conveyed transit related property and equipment to the city and has conveyed the mw columbia canal and hydroelectric plant to the city 
sce g will continue to operate the plant for the city until sce g will also pay the central midlands regional transit authority up to million as matching funds for federal transit administration grants for the purchase of new transit coaches and a new transit facility 
the cost of the franchise agreement is recorded in other regulatory assets 
public service company of north carolina  incorporated psnc energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the ncuc as to gas rates  issuance of securities other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less  accounting and other matters 
psnc energy s rates are established using a benchmark cost of gas approved by the ncuc  which may be modified periodically to reflect changes in the market price of natural gas 
psnc energy revises its tariffs with the ncuc as necessary to track these changes and accounts for any over or under collections of the deferred cost of gas in its deferred accounts for subsequent rate consideration 
the ncuc reviews psnc energy s gas purchasing practices annually

per therm effective march  in april the ncuc issued an order permanently approving psnc energy s request to establish its commodity cost of gas for large commercial and industrial customers on the basis of market prices for natural gas 
this mechanism allows psnc energy to collect from its customers amounts approximating the amounts paid for natural gas 
a state expansion fund  established by the north carolina general assembly in and funded by refunds from psnc energy s interstate pipeline transporters  provides financing for expansion into areas that otherwise would not be economically feasible to serve 
in june the ncuc approved psnc energy s requests for disbursement of up to million from psnc energy s expansion fund to extend natural gas service to madison  jackson and swain counties in western north carolina 
psnc energy estimates that the cost of this project will be approximately million 
the madison county and jackson county portions of the project were completed by the end of at december  approximately million had been spent on this project 
the unused portion of psnc energy s expansion fund is recorded in prepaid assets 
in december the ncuc issued an order approving scana s acquisition of psnc energy 
as specified in the order  psnc energy reduced its rates by approximately million in each of august and august  and agreed to a moratorium on general rate cases until august general rate relief can be obtained during this period to recover costs associated with materially adverse governmental actions and force majeure events 
south carolina pipeline corporation scpc s purchased gas adjustment for cost recovery and gas purchasing policies are reviewed annually by the scpsc 
in an august order  the scpsc found that for the period january through march scpc s gas purchasing policies and practices were prudent and that scpc properly adhered to the gas cost recovery provisions of its gas tariff 
regulatory matters federal scana is a registered public utility holding company under puhca 
scana and its subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec as to financings  acquisitions and diversifications  affiliate transactions and other matters 
a customary three year renewal of the company s financing and other authorizations under puhca was received on february  the company s regulated business operations were impacted by ferc order no 
and other related initiatives of the ferc 
order no 
required each utility under ferc jurisdiction that operates an electric transmission system to submit plans for the possible formation of a regional transmission organization 
in march ferc gave provisional approval to sce g and two other southeastern electric utilities to establish gridsouth as an independent regional transmission company  responsible for operating and planning the utilities combined transmission systems 
in june gridsouth implementation was suspended pending the issuance and evaluation of new ferc directives 
in july ferc issued a nopr on standard market design which proposes sweeping changes to the country s existing regulatory framework governing transmission  open access and energy markets and which will attempt  in large measure  to standardize the national energy market 
while it is anticipated that significant changes to the nopr may occur and that implementation  presently scheduled for september  may not occur for some time  any rules standardizing the markets may have significant impact on the company s access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on the company s marketing of power outside its service territory 
the company is currently evaluating this nopr to determine what effect it will have on its operations 
additional directives from ferc are expected later in critical accounting policies and new accounting standards following are descriptions of the company s accounting policies which are new or most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations 
sfas the company s regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated 
at december  the company had recorded approximately million and million of regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  including amounts recorded for deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
management believes the regulatory assets are recoverable through rates 
the state commissions which regulate the utilities have reviewed and approved most of the items shown as regulatory assets through specific orders 
other items represent costs which were not yet approved for recovery by the state commissions 
in recording these costs as regulatory assets  management believes the costs will be allowable under existing rate making concepts that are embodied in current rate orders received by the company 
however  ultimate recovery is subject to state commission approval 
in the future  as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment  the company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of sfas and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the company s electric distribution and gas distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded 
it is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected 
certain of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities arise from its environmental assessment program  which identifies and evaluates current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup 
as site assessments are initiated  estimates are made of the amount of expenditures  if any  deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site 
these estimates are refined as additional information becomes available  therefore  actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates 
regulatory assets and liabilities related to environmental cleanup affect primarily the gas distribution segment and are due to the costs associated with current and former mgp sites 
revenue recognition unbilled revenues revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers 
because customers of our utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters  we record estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period 
such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters 
such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class  the effects of different rate schedules  changes in weather and  where applicable  the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures 
the accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs 
as of december  and  accounts receivable include unbilled revenues of million and million  respectively 
total revenues for and were billion and billion  respectively 
allowance for funds used during construction afc afc  a noncash item  reflects the period cost of capital devoted to plant under construction 
this accounting practice results in the inclusion of  as a component of construction cost  the costs of debt and equity capital dedicated to construction investment 
afc is included in rate base investment and is depreciated as a component of plant cost in establishing rates for utility services 
the company s regulated subsidiaries calculated afc using composite rates of  and for  and  respectively 
these rates do not exceed the maximum allowable rate as calculated under ferc order no 
interest on nuclear fuel in process is capitalized at the actual interest amount incurred 
afc primarily affects the electric operations segment due to its capital intensive construction program  and to a lesser extent  afc affects the gas distribution and gas transmission segments 
afc represented approximately of income before income taxes  gains  losses  impairments and the cumulative effect of an accounting change in  in and in because the equity component of afc is not taxable  increased afc reduces the company s effective tax rate 
see results of operations for additional discussion 
provisions for bad debts and allowances for doubtful accounts as of each balance sheet date  the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of actual write offs which might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history 
the distribution segments of the company s regulated utilities have an established write off history  and the regulated service areas enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provision for bad debts 
the company s retail gas marketing segment operates in georgia s natural gas market 
as such  estimation of the provision for bad debts related to this segment is subject to greater imprecision 
in  the retail gas marketing segment expensed approximately million related to bad debt  which represents approximately of its gross revenue 
had an additional of gross revenues been reserved for bad debts  net income in would have been reduced by approximately million 
nuclear decommissioning accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
among the factors that could change sce g s accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology  changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements  as well as changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows 
see also the discussion of the company s adoption of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  below 
changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the company s financial position and cash flows although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral  because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers 
sce g s share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for summer station  including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination  totals approximately million  stated in dollars  based on a decommissioning study completed in santee cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station 
the cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the nrc under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use 
sce g s method of funding decommissioning costs is referred to as comrep cost of money reduction plan 
under this plan  funds collected through rates are used to pay premiums on insurance policies on the lives of certain company personnel 
sce g is the beneficiary of these policies 
through these insurance contracts  sce g is able to take advantage of income tax benefits and accrue earnings on the fund on a tax deferred basis 
amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates  insurance proceeds  and interest on proceeds  less expenses  are transferred by sce g to an external trust fund 
management intends for the fund  including earnings thereon  to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis 
pension accounting scana follows sfas  employers accounting for pensions  in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan 
scana s plan is fully funded and as such  net pension income is reflected in the financial statements see results of operations 
sfas requires the use of several assumptions  the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded 
among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets 
net pension income of million recorded in reflects the use of a discount rate and an assumed long term return on plan assets 
scana believes that these assumptions were  and that the resulting pension income amount was  reasonable 
due to poor performance in the stock market in recent years  the company has determined to adjust its assumed long term return on assets to for lower interest rates have also led to a reduction in the discount rate as of december  to 
had those assumptions been in place in  net pension income would have been reduced by approximately million 
in determining the appropriate discount rate  the company considers the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities 
as such  the company selected the above discount rate of as being within a reasonable range of moody s aa interest rate as of december  this same discount rate was also selected for determination of opeb liabilities discussed below 
the following information with respect to pension assets should also be noted the company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
in developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions  the company evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisors  including such advisors review of the plan s historical  and year cumulative actual returns of  and  respectively  which have all been in excess of related broad indices 
the company anticipates that investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 
the expected long term rate of return of is based on an asset allocation of with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
while management believes that the asset allocation will return to those levels  because of market fluctuations  the actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
while the recent investment performance and the decline in discount rate have significantly reduced the level of pension income  the pension trust has been and remains adequately funded  and no contributions have been required since as such  recent declines in pension income have had no impact on the company s cash flows 
based on stress testing performed by the company s actuaries  management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until at least accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions similar to its pension accounting  scana follows sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits 
this plan is unfunded  so no assumptions related to return on assets impact the net expense recorded  however  the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense 
scana used a discount rate of and recorded a net sfas cost of million for had the selected discount rate been  the expense for would have been approximately million higher 
sfas in connection with the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performed a valuation analysis of its investment in scpc gas transmission segment using a discounted cash flow analysis and of psnc energy gas distribution segment using an independent appraisal 
the analysis for scpc indicated that the fair value of related goodwill exceeded its carrying amount 
the independent appraisal made various assumptions related to cash flow projections  discount rates  weighted average cost of capital and market multiples for comparable companies 
the analysis indicated that the carrying amount of psnc energy s acquisition adjustment goodwill exceeded its fair value  and as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million as the cumulative effect of an accounting change  effective january  sfas requires the company to perform valuation analyses annually 
such analyses will incorporate updated assumptions similar to those used for the initial valuations 
sfas sfas provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to the future obligations to retire assets aro 
sfas applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from acquisition  construction  development and normal operations 
the company adopted sfas effective january  because such obligation relates solely to the company s regulated electric utility  adoption of sfas will have no impact on results of operations  however  the company will record an aro of approximately million  which exceeds the previously recorded reserve for nuclear plant decommissioning of approximately million 
in addition to the aro for summer station  the company believes that there is legal uncertainty as to the existence of environmental obligations associated with certain transmission and distribution properties 
the company believes that any aro related to this type of property would be insignificant and  due to the indeterminate life of the related assets  an aro could not be reasonably estimated 
the company s regulated operations record cost of removal as a component of accumulated depreciation for property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation 
as of december   the company estimates that approximately million of its accumulated depreciation balance is related to this regulatory liability 
other matters unconsolidated special purpose entities although scana invests in securities and business ventures  it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and it does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions other than incidental operating leases in the normal course of business  generally for office space  furniture and equipment 
synthetic fuel investments sce g holds two equity method investments in partnerships involved in converting coal to non conventional fuel  the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits 
the aggregate investment in these partnerships as of december  is approximately million  and through december   they had generated and passed through to sce g approximately million in such tax credits 
under a plan approved by the scpsc  any tax credits generated and ultimately passed through to sce g from synfuel produced and consumed by sce g have been and will be deferred and will be applied to offset the capital costs of projects required to comply with legislative or regulatory actions 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements 
nuclear license extension in august sce g filed an application with the nrc for a year license extension for its summer station 
if approved  the extension would allow the plant to operate through sce g estimates that it will incur approximately million in costs related to the application process 
radio service network in april sci sold its mhz radio service network within south carolina to motorola  inc claims and litigation in an unsuccessful bidder for the purchase of propane gas assets of scana filed suit against scana in south carolina circuit court  seeking unspecified damages 
the suit alleges the existence of a contract for the sale of assets to the plaintiff and various causes of action associated with that contract 
the company is confident in its position and intends to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
the company does not believe that the resolution of this issue will have a material impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in the company entered into  in the ordinary course of business  a year take and pay contract with an unaffiliated natural gas supplier supplier to purchase  dt of natural gas per day beginning in the spring of in december  as a result of the failure of supplier and its guarantor to meet contractual obligations related to credit support provisions  the company terminated the contract 
attempts to negotiate a new contract between the parties were not successful 
in february  the company received notification from supplier of its request for binding arbitration under the original contract 
the company is confident of the propriety of its actions and will vigorously pursue its position in such arbitration proceedings 
the company further believes that the resolution of these claims will not have a material adverse impact on its results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the company is also engaged in various other claims and litigation incidental to its business operations which management anticipates will be resolved without material loss to the company

instruments designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge risks associated with fixed price obligations in a volatile market and risks associated with price differentials at different delivery locations 
the basic types of financial instruments utilized are exchange traded instruments  such as nymex futures contracts or options  and over the counter instruments such as swaps  which are typically offered by energy and financial institutions 
policies and procedures and risk limits are established to control the level of market  credit  liquidity and operational and administrative risks assumed by the company 
the company s board of directors has delegated to a risk management committee the authority to set risk limits  establish policies and procedures for risk management and measurement  and oversee and review the risk management process and infrastructure 
the risk management committee  which is comprised of certain officers  including the company s risk management officer  and senior officers of the company  provides assurance to the board of directors with regard to the management of risk and brings to the board s attention any areas of concern
