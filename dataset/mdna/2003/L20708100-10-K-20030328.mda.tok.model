item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations herein 
minimum lease payments on the agreements  which have fixed payment terms are presented in note c to the group s consolidated financial statements 
total fees earned by the group from other managed container owners were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
owned containers cronos uses various forms of debt funding to finance its owned fleet including bank loans and capital leases 
container ownership provides the group with the ability to generate lease revenues over the life of the container  matched with related interest and depreciation expenses 
from time to time  cronos also owns containers on a temporary basis until such time that the containers are sold to its container equity programs and other managed container owner programs 
most containers targeted for transfer to managed programs are purchased new by cronos  and sold to a managed container owner within six months 
this strategy allows cronos more flexibility to negotiate and buy containers strategically  based on market conditions and later sell these containers after the initial lease profile is established for a particular group of containers 
environmental countries that are signatories to the montreal protocol on the environment agreed in november to restrict the use of environmentally destructive refrigerants  banning production but not use of chlorofluorocarbon compounds cfcs beginning in january cfcs are used in the operation  insulation and manufacture of refrigerated containers 
all of cronos refrigerated containers purchased since june use non cfc refrigerant gas in the operation and insulation of the containers  although a reduced quantity of cfcs are still used in the container manufacturing process 
the replacement refrigerant used in the group s new refrigerated containers may also become subject to similar governmental regulations 
during  cronos conducted a review of the majority of its owned containers that were manufactured in and earlier 
as a result of this review  a million impairment charge was recorded against the carrying value of  containers 
this review targeted owned off hire containers for immediate disposal 
owned containers that are currently on a lease will be disposed of when they are off hired 
in the past  the group has retrofitted certain refrigerated containers with non cfc refrigerants 
cronos has decided not to retrofit any additional containers 
in the unlikely event that any such further retrofitting expenses should be required  they would not be material to the financial position or results of operations of the group 
the environmental impact of refrigerant gases has become increasingly prominent 
on january   it became illegal for environmentally destructive refrigerants to be handled  other than for disposal  in most of the countries that are members of the european union 
employees as of december   cronos had employees worldwide  were located in europe  in the united states and in asia and australia combined 
none of cronos employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
insurance cronos lease agreements typically require lessees to obtain insurance to cover all risks of physical damage and loss of the equipment under lease  as well as public liability and property damage insurance 
however  the precise nature and amount of the insurance carried by each ocean carrier varies from lessee to lessee 
in addition  cronos has purchased secondary insurance effective in the event that a lessee fails to have adequate primary coverage 
this insurance covers liability arising out of bodily injury and or property damage as a result of the ownership and operation of the containers  as well as insurance against loss or damage to the containers  loss of lease revenue in certain cases and cost of container recovery and repair in the event that a customer goes into bankruptcy 
cronos believes that the nature and amounts of its insurance are customary in the container leasing industry and subject to standard industry deductions and exclusions 
item properties cronos leases approximately  square feet of office space near london  england  from where its container leasing operations are conducted 
cronos also leases approximately  square feet of office space of which approximately  square feet is sub let in san francisco  california  where its managed container owner activities are based 
cronos also conducts its container leasing operations from offices in new jersey  genoa  gothenburg  hamburg  hong kong  singapore and sydney generally under shorter term leases of varying durations

item legal proceedings disputes with the contrin group contrin s million claim 
the group manages containers for investment entities sponsored by or affiliated with contrin holding sa  a luxembourg holding company contrin 
approximately measured by teus of the group s fleet of containers is owned by contrin 
the group is in litigation with contrin over funds that contrin claims to have remitted to cronos for the purchase of containers 
contrin claims that in it transmitted million to cronos for the purchase of containers 
the group did not receive these funds and believes that the funds were diverted to an account controlled by stefan m 
palatin  a former chairman and chief executive officer of the company  and that this was known or should have been known by contrin 
on august   contrin  through its affiliate  contrin worldwide container leasing gmbh cwc  filed an action in the luxembourg district court against the company  seeking recovery of million  together with interest and costs 
on january   the company responded to cwc s complaint  i requesting that the district court dismiss the proceeding for lack of jurisdiction over the dispute  and ii denying contrin s claims on the merits 
since january   the parties have supplemented their pleadings and filed documentary evidence with the court to respond to assertions made and evidence submitted by the other party 
no date has been set for a final hearing on cwc s claims against the company 
on september   the company issued its intervening summons in the proceeding  naming mr 
palatin  his wife  and klamath enterprises sa klamath as cross defendants 
by its intervening summons  the company claims the right to indemnity from the palatins and klamath for any liability imposed upon the company in favor of contrin on contrin s claims against the company 
klamath is a panamanian company and the record owner of an estate located in amersham  england 
the company alleges that a substantial portion of the million transferred by contrin for the purchase of containers was diverted by the palatins to improve and furnish the amersham estate  in which they lived in  and that mr 
palatin is the beneficial owner of klamath 
the company has served the summons on klamath and is in the process of serving the summons on the palatins 
once served  the cross defendants will have the opportunity to file responsive pleadings and evidence 
klamath  through its austrian counsel  has indicated that it will challenge the jurisdiction of the luxembourg court over it 
in anticipation of the filing of contrin s claims against the company in luxembourg  the group  on june   filed a protective claim in the high court of justice  london  england  against mr 
palatin and his wife 
by this claim  the group seeks to establish that the palatins are liable to the group for any liability which the group may have to contrin arising out of the transfers 
on march   the group secured a freezing injunction from the high court of justice in aid of its uk claim against the palatins 
by the injunction  the palatins are prohibited from selling  charging  or otherwise disposing of their interest in the amersham estate 
the injunction also extends to klamath  the record owner of the estate 
the palatins and klamath contested the jurisdiction of the high court of justice over them  or  in the alternative  requested that the court exercise its discretion not to exercise jurisdiction over them 
in support of their application  the palatins filed an affidavit with the court asserting that the amersham estate is owned by pontino sa  a panamanian company  in which they disclaim any interest 
the group opposed the applications of the palatins and klamath 
a hearing was held on the defendants motion for dismissal on november   and on december   the court rendered its decision rejecting the defendants motion for dismissal 
a further hearing was held on february   at which time the court rejected the defendants motion for leave to appeal the court s decision  and awarded the company of its costs in opposing the motions  ordering the defendants to pay  on account of these costs 
the defendants have indicated they may petition the court of appeal for its consent to appeal the court s decision on jurisdiction 
in light of the company s issuance of its intervening summons against the palatins and klamath in the luxembourg proceeding  described above  the group sought a stay of prosecution of the uk proceeding pending the outcome of the luxembourg proceeding 
the court  by its decision of december   rejecting the defendants motion to dismiss  declined to stay prosecution of the uk proceeding pending the outcome of the luxembourg proceeding 
accordingly  depending upon whether the defendants appeal the court s ruling on jurisdiction  the group will have to decide whether to pursue its claim for indemnity against the palatins and klamath in luxembourg or in the uk 
on july   the group also filed a protective claim against barclays bank plc barclays in the high court of justice  london  england 
barclays was the bank that received the million from contrin 
by its claim  the group seeks a declaration that barclays is liable to the group for million  plus interest and costs  arising out of contrin s transfer to an account with barclays in the name of mrs 
palatin 
in february  the group obtained an order from the court requiring the production of documents by barclays 
the group and barclays have agreed to a stay of the action and that stay remains in place

the palatins filed their application for dismissal with the court on july   alleging that the court has no jurisdiction over them 
cnv opposed both applications  and both were heard by the court at the same time as klamath s and the palatins challenge to the jurisdiction of the uk court over them with respect to the group s million claim against them  discussed above 
the court  by its decision of december   rejected the defendants jurisdictional challenge to cnv s claim 
contrin s disposals claim 
on september   three austrian affiliates of contrin filed a claim against cnv in the high court of justice  london  england the disposals claim 
the claimants assert that cnv has breached container management agreements entered into in by selling containers without obtaining the consent of the claimants  in violation of the terms of the container management agreements 
the claimants assert that they are entitled to all sums received by cnv from the sale of containers wrongfully disposed of under the container management agreements or  alternatively  that cnv is liable for damages for wrongfully depriving the claimants of the use and possession of the containers sold 
claimants assert damages in excess of million  and request an accounting  interest  and costs 
cnv filed its defense to the disposals claim on december   denying the substantive allegations of the claim and that the claimants are entitled to the relief claimed or to any other relief

item submission of matters to a vote of security holders not applicable part ii item market for the company s common equity and related stockholder matters as of march   there were outstanding  common shares 
they were held of record by approximately holders 
prior to december  there was no trading market for the company s common shares 
subsequent to the company s public offering  the common shares were quoted and traded over the counter on the nasdaq national market system under the symbol crnsf 
in march  the company announced that it would comply with the reporting requirements applicable generally to us public companies and would therefore trade under the symbol crns 
there is no trading market for the common shares outside the united states 
the table below shows the high and low reported closing prices for the common shares on the nasdaq national market system for the last two years for the quarterly periods ending on the dates indicated 
closing prices are market quotations and reflect inter dealer prices  without retail mark up  mark down or commission and may not necessarily represent actual transactions 
price range high low march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  there are currently no luxembourg foreign exchange control restrictions on the payment of dividends on the common shares or on the conduct of cronos operations 
in addition  there are no limitations on holding or voting applicable to foreign holders of common shares  imposed by luxembourg law  by the company s articles of incorporation or otherwise  other than those restrictions which apply equally to luxembourg holders of common shares 
the following summary of the material luxembourg tax consequences is not a comprehensive description of all of the tax considerations that are applicable to the holders of common shares  and does not deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories of holders  some of which may be subject to special rules 
under present luxembourg law  as long as the company maintains its status as a holding company  no income tax  withholding tax including with respect to dividends  capital gains tax or estate inheritance tax is payable in luxembourg by shareholders in respect of the common shares  except for shareholders domiciled  resident or  in certain circumstances  formerly resident or having a permanent establishment in luxembourg 
the reciprocal tax treaty between the united states and luxembourg limiting the rate of any withholding tax is therefore inapplicable 
on december   the board of directors of the company resolved to commence the payment of quarterly dividends on the outstanding common shares of the company  subject to the company s ongoing ability to pay such dividends 
because under luxembourg law and the company s articles of association  dividends may not be declared during the first six months of the year unless a meeting of shareholders is held and the shareholders approve the financial statements for the prior calendar year  and because the annual meeting of shareholders is scheduled to be held during the second quarter of  the board of directors declared a dividend of cents per common share on the outstanding common shares of the company  cents per common share for the fourth quarter of which was paid january  to shareholders of record as of december   and cents per common share for the first calendar quarter of  payable april  to shareholders of record on march  in addition  on december   the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  of the company s common shares

depending on market conditions and other factors  share repurchases may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time  without prior notice 
the company has retained deutsche bank securities  inc to effect all repurchases under the program 
as of december   the company had repurchased  of its common shares at an aggregate price of  or  on average  per share

general the segment information presented in note to the group s consolidated financial statements relates to the portions of the group s fleet owned by the group itself  owned containers  or by the group s managed container programs managed container owners  which comprise container equity programs and other managed container owners 
owned containers include containers held for resale 
the group bears the risk of ownership with respect to containers in the owned containers segment  but not with respect to the majority of containers in the managed container owners segment  although the group bears the risk that the management agreements could be terminated  resulting in the removal of the corresponding managed containers from the fleet 
at december   approximately  and of the group s fleet by original equipment cost was owned by way of container equity programs  other managed container owners and owned containers  respectively 
all containers  whether owned or managed  are operated as part of a single fleet 
the group has discretion over which ocean carriers  container manufacturers and suppliers of goods and services it deals with 
since the group s management agreements with the managed container owners meet the definition of leases in sfas no 
sfas accounting for leases  they are accounted for in the group s financial statements as leases under which the container owners are lessors and the group is lessee 
in  of payments to managed container owners represented agreements which generally provided that the amounts payable to container owners were based upon the rentals to ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and a management fee

gross lease revenue is generated by leasing to ocean carriers  marine containers that are owned either by managed container owners or by the group itself and represents revenue from operating leases  excluding billings in advance 
these amounts are billed on a monthly basis 
amounts due under master leases are calculated by the group at the end of each month and billed approximately to days thereafter 
amounts due under term leases are set forth in the respective lease agreements and are generally billed and payable on a monthly basis 
changes in gross lease revenue depend primarily upon fleet size  utilization rates and per diem rates 
equipment trading revenue represents revenue earned from the sale of equipment to third parties 
equipment trading expenses are the costs of the equipment sold 
in equipment trading transactions  the group enters into an agreement in which it undertakes to supply equipment to a third party 
simultaneously  cronos enters into a separate agreement with a container manufacturer for the acquisition of the equipment 
the group acts as principal in such transactions and accordingly the revenue and expenses are reported gross 
this equipment does not enter the cronos fleet of managed containers 
commissions  fees and other operating income includes acquisition fees relating to the group s managed container programs  income from direct financing leases containers leased under lease purchase arrangements  fees earned in connection with equipment consultancy and design services  license fee income earned in connection with the patented cpcs see fleet profile herein  fees from the disposal of used containers  and miscellaneous other fees and income 
this item is affected by the size of managed programs and the contracted acquisition fee  the level of consultancy and design work undertaken  the quantity of cpcs acquired by third parties  the number and value of direct financing leases and income from disposals of used containers 
the quantity of cpcs acquired is in turn affected by the availability of financing to the third party purchasers 
although acquisition fees are generally received in cash at the inception of a managed container program and are non refundable  they are amortized in the statement of operations on a straight line basis over the period of the managed container agreement to which they relate 
direct operating expenses are direct costs associated with leasing both owned and managed containers 
these expenses may be categorized as activity related  inventory related  and legal and other expenses 
activity related expenses include agents costs and depot costs such as repairs  maintenance and handling 
inventory related expenses relate to off hire containers and comprise storage and repositioning costs 
these costs are sensitive to the quantity of off hire containers as well as the frequency at which containers are re delivered

material off balance sheet arrangements  transactions and obligations joint venture container purchase entity 
in september  cronos established the joint venture program with a major international financial services provider the bank  and a current lender to the company 
the purpose of the joint venture program is to acquire and lease to third party lessees marine cargo containers through a joint venture owned by a subsidiary of the company and owned by an affiliate of the bank 
the joint venture entity is a bankruptcy remote  special purpose company organized under the laws of bermuda and is accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the bank and another financial institution have committed a total of million in debt financing to the joint venture program  and the group and the bank have each committed approximately million in equity to the joint venture program 
the intention is to expand the joint venture program  as additional lenders become part of the lending group  with the lenders providing up to of the cost of acquiring the containers and the joint venture partners each providing one half of the equity to fund the balance of the capital requirements of the joint venture program 
interest in other managed container owner 
see critical accounting policies herein and note to the group s consolidated financial statements 
cronos holds a share in a managed container owner to which it sold million of containers in a series of transactions in prior years 
cronos manages the containers in return for a management fee and holds non interest bearing loan notes and an option to acquire of the container owning company in august for one us dollar 
the loan notes  which had a carrying value of million at december   are subordinate to other loan notes due to third parties and fall due for repayment after the other loan notes have been repaid from funds generated from the containers 
fixed non cancellable operating leases 
cronos  as lessee  has entered into fixed operating lease contracts for container equipment  computer equipment and office space 
in the rental expense was million of which the fixed operating lease rental expense for container equipment was million

guarantee to us limited partnership 
during  the group provided a guarantee under a million third party loan note the note  with a maturity date  to a us limited partnership 
under the terms of the guarantee  the group may be liable for any principal and interest outstanding under the terms of the note in the event of a default by the us limited partnership 
at december   the balance outstanding under the note was million 
guarantee of third party loan rent support agreement 
during and  the group sold a total of million of equipment  which was under a direct financing lease with a major shipping line  to a third party 
the third party financed the acquisition of this equipment with a loan of million  with a maturity date  to which the group provided a first loss guarantee for of the outstanding debt 
the group can collateralize up to of the guarantee with a first security interest in additional equipment 
at december   the balance outstanding under the loan was million 
in addition  under the terms of a rent support agreement for which cronos earns a fee of million per annum  the group is required to deposit an amount equal to the aggregate of all rental charges scheduled to be paid under the direct financing lease for the next twelve months or until the end of the lease  if sooner  upon the occurrence of a continuing event of default by the shipping line 
annual rental charges under the lease  with a scheduled maturity date  approximate million 
guarantee under a purchase  assignment and agency agreement 
during  the group entered into a term lease with a lessee in the ordinary course of business 
during  the containers held under the lease were sold  and the lease assigned  to a financial institution 
the transaction was accounted for as a sale 
as part of this contract  the group continues to manage the containers held under the term lease and invoices the lessee and collects monies on behalf of the financial institution 
rental under the lease is approximately million per annum of which the group remits million to the financial institution as rent and million to a retention account held as security by the institution 
as compensation for this service  the group earns an agency fee 
under the terms of the contract with the financial institution  if the lessee fails to make payments  other than in the event of being declared bankrupt  the group has guaranteed that it will continue to make payments to the financial institution 
the guarantee and agreement with the financial institution will expire in agreements with other managed container owners early termination options 
approximately based on original equipment cost of the agreements with other managed container owners contain early termination options  whereby the container owner may terminate the agreement if certain performance thresholds are not achieved 
at december   approximately based on original equipment cost of total agreements were eligible for early termination 
cronos believes that early termination of these agreements by the other managed container owners is unlikely 
agreements with other managed container owners change of control provisions 
approximately based on original equipment cost of agreements with other managed container owners provide that a change in ownership of the group  without the prior consent of the container owner  may constitute an event of default under the agreement 
in substantially all of these agreements  the consent of the container owners may not be unreasonably withheld 
in the event that consent is not obtained  of total agreements may require the group to transfer possession of the equipment to another equipment manager 
such transfer of possession may result in the group incurring certain costs 
the remaining of total agreements may require the group to purchase the equipment from the container owners pursuant to the terms of their respective agreements  generally a stipulated percentage determined by age of the equipment of the original cost of the equipment

in  and  the group sold containers to a third party container owner for a total of million 
the total consideration for the container sales comprised cash  management fees receivable on revenues earned by the containers  non interest bearing loan notes and an option to acquire of the container owning company in august for one us dollar 
the loan notes  which are subordinate to other loan notes due to third parties  fall due for repayment after the other loan notes have been repaid from funds generated from the containers  which are managed by the group 
the four elements of the transactions were essential and integral parts of the consideration 
collectively  they gave the group the right to receive management fees and certain proceeds on the disposal of the containers 
management periodically discounts the projected future net cash flows to be generated by the containers based on historic and projected trends for per diem revenues  utilization  container disposal proceeds and funding costs over the expected remaining life of the containers 
the discounted value of the future cash flows is used to support the combined carrying value of the loan note and management fees receivable from the third party container owner 
the group recorded an impairment charge against the carrying value of the receivables from the third party container owner in the second quarter of due to the global economic downturn  management revised the projections for per diem revenues and utilization downwards 
based on the revised projected trends  the group considered that the carrying value of the loan notes due from the third party container owner exceeded the discounted value of the future cash flows by million 
under current projections  gross lease revenue is forecast to increase in by approximately over the level reported in and remain at this level until the fleet size decreases due to container disposals 
projected gross lease revenue is based on current per diem and utilization rates 
the underlying leasing and disposal assumptions are consistent with year historical information including available information for comparable us limited partnerships and other managed programs 
the maximum estimated remaining life for the containers is years 
although the projected trends are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgement for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values  cash collections and interest rates 
container equipment depreciable lives 
refrigerated container equipment is depreciated over a useful life of years to a residual value of 
dry cargo and other container equipment is depreciated over a useful life of years to a residual value of 
management re evaluates the period of amortization and residual values to determine whether subsequent events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives and residual values 
container equipment valuation 
the group reviews container equipment when changes in circumstances require consideration as to whether the carrying value of the equipment has become impaired  pursuant to guidance established in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management considers assets to be impaired if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the future projected cash flows from related operations undiscounted and without interest charges 
when impairment is deemed to exist  the assets are written down to fair value or projected discounted cash flows from related operations 
the group periodically evaluates future cash flows and potential impairment of its fleet by container type rather than for each individual container 
therefore  future losses could result for individual container disposals due to various factors including age  condition  suitability for continued leasing  as well as geographic location of the containers where disposed 
deferred taxation 
under sfas no 
sfas accounting for income taxes  the group is required to record a valuation allowance if realization of a deferred tax asset is not more likely than not 
substantial weight must be given to recent historical results and near term projections  and management must assess the availability of tax planning strategies that might impact either the need for  or the amount of  any valuation allowance 
based on the recent history of operating losses in its us subsidiaries  the near term outlook and management s evaluation of available tax planning strategies  the group has maintained a valuation allowance for its deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards in the us since as of december   the group s valuation allowance aggregated million 
in the event the group were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax asset  a reversal of part or all of the valuation allowance would be recorded 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
cronos continually tracks its credit exposure to each customer using specialist third party credit information services and reports prepared by local staff to assess credit applications 
cronos credit committee meets quarterly to analyze the performance of existing customers and to recommend actions to be taken in order to minimize credit risks 
over the last years  bad debts have approximated of lease revenues 
based on this information  cronos has calculated an allowance for doubtful accounts comprising specific amounts provided against known probable losses plus an additional amount based on loss experience 
however  the group may be subject to unexpected loss in rental revenue from container lessees that default under their container lease agreements 
intangibles 
intangible assets consist of goodwill and patents 
on january   the group adopted sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over that life and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
patents will continue to be amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  to a residual of zero 
in addition to market valuations  the annual impairment test uses cash flow discounting techniques to determine the fair value of respective reporting units 
management discounts the projected future net cash flows to be generated by the reporting units based on historic and projected trends for per diem revenues  utilization  container disposal proceeds and funding costs over the expected remaining life of the unit 
although the projected trends are based on historical and current available information  they require subjective management judgement for projections relating to utilization rates  per diem rates  the disposal age of the containers  equipment residual values  cash collections and interest rates 
results of operations improved market conditions for all container types and the implementation of several cronos marketing initiatives during resulted in a reduction in off hire container inventories 
utilization increased by from at the beginning of the year to by the end of december 
lower levels of new worldwide container production in and the first half of addressed  to some extent  the problems of container over supply caused by higher levels of production in and as a result  demand increased for the existing container fleets of leasing companies and shipping lines 
in many parts of asia and particularly in the south eastern ports  demand exceeded supply 
in addition  in  imports to europe and the us declined thereby slowing the build up in container inventories in these locations 
to exploit such opportunities  the group repositioned off hire equipment to locations of greatest demand and pursued leasing opportunities through its global network of marketing resources 
since december  the combined per diem rate for the cronos fleet of dry cargo containers declined by approximately 
most of this decline occurred in the first three months of and is attributable to three main factors 
per diem rental rates decreased in line with the reduction in container prices and interest rates 
cronos converted lease agreements with several shipping lines from master to long term lease 
these conversions provide greater revenue stability but at lower lease rates than master leases 
cronos initiated new long term leases for older equipment which  while resulting in lower per diem rates  significantly lowered inventory levels 
the combined effect of the reduction in per diem rates resulted in reduced gross lease revenue  but also significantly lowered direct operating expenses due to the reduction in storage and other inventory costs 
the following chart summarizes the combined utilization of the cronos fleet based on approximate original equipment cost utilization at december average utilization during the year cronos uses debt and capital leases to finance the acquisition of container equipment and investments in direct financing leases 
the primary facilities include financial covenants that are tested on a quarterly basis relating to minimum tangible net worth  maximum level of total liabilities to tangible net worth  maximum level of debt and capital lease obligations to tangible net worth  interest expense coverage and debt service coverage 
in  the group was in compliance with these covenants 
future compliance with the covenants will depend on the ability of the group to report a minimum level of income before income taxes for each quarter equal to of interest expense for that quarter  and to generate sufficient cash from operations and other activities to maintain the current portion of borrowings within financial covenant limits 
the breach of a covenant constitutes an event of default 
the group operates a diversified fleet of containers  including refrigerated containers  tanks  cpcs and rolltrailers 
specialized containers account for over of the cronos owned fleet based on original equipment cost 
due to their specialized nature  demand for certain of these containers is less likely to be affected by global economic downturns 
cronos reported net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the following chart represents certain key performance measurements  expressed as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  gross lease revenue payments to managed container owners direct operating expenses depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative expenses interest expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross lease revenue of million for the year ended december   was million  or  lower than for the year ended december  revenue from dry cargo and refrigerated containers accounted for all of the decline as the effect of the increase in utilization reported during was more than offset by the effect of reduced per diem rates and the disposal of older dry cargo equipment 
equipment trading revenue of million in represented transactions undertaken in which the group used its relationships with equipment manufacturers to assist third parties to design and acquire their own equipment and organize delivery to designated locations 
equipment trading expenses represented equipment and related costs for this activity 
the group earned million from equipment trading activity during  compared with million in commissions  fees and other operating income of million in was million  or  lower than in reductions of million in cpc license fee income due to lower third party demand for new cpc containers during  million in amortized acquisition fee income reflecting a maturing portfolio of managed container programs  million on fees earned on the disposal of managed container program containers  million in design and consultancy fee income  million in property rental income and in other items were partly offset by an million increase in income earned on direct financing leases 
interest income of million for the year ended december  was unchanged when compared to the prior year

equity in earnings of affiliate of million in represents the recognition of the cronos share of earnings from the joint venture program entity that was set up in september of direct operating expenses were million in  a decrease of million  or  compared to reduced storage costs accounted for almost all of the decline and reflected lower inventory levels due to increased demand for dry cargo containers during the year 
payments to managed container owners were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this is due primarily to the decline in dry cargo container net lease revenue for each of the managed segments 
depreciation and amortization was million for  compared with million for depreciation expense for leasehold and computer assets was million lower than in this is due to certain computer assets reaching the end of their useful life and the relocation of the uk office to new leasehold premises in the second quarter of this was offset by a million increase in container depreciation expense reflecting the addition of new container equipment 
the amortization of intangible assets declined by million in due to the adoption of sfas no 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million  when compared to reductions of million in information technology costs and million in occupancy costs were more than offset by increased manpower costs of million  increased professional services expenses of million and increased business insurance and other costs of million 
the decrease in occupancy costs was mainly due to an office relocation in the uk during during  the decline in the us dollar relative to the uk pound and to the euro had the effect of increasing the cost of overheads in these economic areas 
interest expense of million in  was million  or  lower than in the decline in interest expense was attributable to the reduction in interest rates and lower total debt balances in income taxes 
during the second quarter of  the group agreed to a settlement with a foreign taxation authority 
this followed a review that focused primarily on the transfer prices under the terms of the principal trading agreements between cronos group companies prior to december  the group had previously recorded a charge of million in this regard 
as a result of the settlement  the group reversed million of the tax liability and recorded a tax benefit of the same amount

year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross lease revenue of million for the year ended december   was million  or  lower than for the year ended december  gross lease revenue for dry cargo containers decreased by million due to the combined effect of lower utilization and per diem rates together with equipment disposals 
revenue for refrigerated containers was million lower than in due to the combined effect of lower utilization and per diem rates  product obsolescence and equipment disposals 
this downward trend was reversed to some extent by the addition of approximately million of new term lease equipment to the fleet during the year 
revenue for tank containers declined by million due primarily to a reduction in per diem rates 
gross lease revenue for dry freight specials was million higher than in the prior year 
equipment trading revenue of million in represented transactions undertaken in which the group used its relationships with equipment manufacturers to assist third parties to design and acquire their own equipment and organize delivery to designated locations 
after deducting equipment trading expenses of million for the year  the group earned million from this activity in commissions  fees and other operating income of million in was million  or  higher than in increases of million earned in connection with equipment design services  million in license fee income earned in connection with the purchase of the patented cpcs and million in direct financing lease income were partly offset by a million reduction in acquisition fees 
during  a gain of million was recorded on the sale of a building 
investment gains of million for the year ended december  represented the sale of shares that had been held in escrow as security for a tax indemnification agreement 
this agreement expired on december   and the shares were released during the first quarter of the gain of million for the year ended december   represented profit realized pursuant to the receipt of shares from two escrow accounts that had been held pending post closing reports and adjustments related to the agreement and plan of merger between transamerica corporation and trans ocean limited in interest income was million in  compared to million in interest income earned in included million of income earned on cash on deposit in investment related escrow accounts  and interest income earned on other cash deposits 
in  a general decline in interest rates and lower cash balances reduced the amount of interest income earned 
direct operating expenses were million in  an increase of million  or  compared to an increase of million in inventory related costs  reflecting a larger off hire fleet  together with an increase in activity related costs of million  was partly offset by a total reduction of million in legal costs and in provisions for doubtful accounts 
payments to managed container owners were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  when compared to the prior year 
this was a result of a decline in net lease revenue due to the global economic environment for those agreements where the amounts payable to container owners were based upon the rentals to ocean carriers after deducting direct operating expenses and a management fee 
payments to us limited partnerships were million lower than the prior year 
payments to other managed container owners were million in  a decrease of million  or  from depreciation and amortization decreased by million  to million during a million increase in container depreciation due to the addition of new equipment during was more than offset by a million reduction in depreciation for non container assets and a reduction in goodwill amortization expense of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  a decline of million  or  when compared to this was primarily due to reductions of million in non operating legal and related expenses  million in manpower costs  million in professional services costs and million in each of occupancy and information technology 
non operating legal and related expenses were million in in  manpower costs included a total of million for bonus and termination costs 
there were minimal expenses for these items in interest expense of million in  was million  or  lower than in this decrease was primarily due to the effect of lower interest rates

these shares have been recorded as common shares in treasury 
the valuation of million was based on the estimated fair value of the shares received 
impairment charges of million for the year ended december   were recorded against certain refrigerated containers and against loan notes receivable from a third party container owner 
in the second quarter of  the group undertook a review of its refrigerated container equipment and identified a number of issues that have had an impact on the carrying value of certain equipment  which uses the r refrigerant gas 
as a result of the review  management concluded that inventories of r equipment would be targeted for immediate sale and that containers with a carrying value of million exceeded fair value 
additionally  a review was conducted of containers with a carrying value of million that were on lease at june  it was concluded that the carrying value of these assets exceeded the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
as a result of these reviews  an impairment charge of million was recorded 
the group also reviewed the carrying value of loan notes receivable from a third party container owner in the second quarter of the carrying value of the loan notes are measured in terms of the discounted value of projected future net cash flows to be generated based on historical and projected trends on per diem revenues  utilization  container disposal proceeds and funding costs over the expected useful life of the containers 
due to the global economic downturn  management revised the projections for per diem revenues and utilization downwards 
based on the revised projected trends  the group considered that the carrying value of the loan notes due from the third party container owner exceeded the discounted value of the future cash flows by million 
accordingly  an impairment of million was recorded see discussion of critical accounting policy herein 
liquidity and capital resources the funding sources available to the group and its consolidated subsidiaries include operating cash flow and borrowings 
the group s operating cash flow is derived from lease revenues generated by the group s container fleet and fee revenues from its managed container programs and other parties 
operating cash flow is utilized to meet costs relating to day to day fleet support  payments to managed container owners  selling  general and administrative expenses  interest expense  servicing the current portion of long term borrowings and financing a portion of certain debt funded equipment acquisitions 
operating cash flow is largely dependent upon the timely collections of lease revenues from shipping lines 
based on loss experience for the last ten years  bad debts have approximated of lease revenues 
the group monitors the aging of lease receivables  collections and the credit status of existing and potential customers 
in the current economic climate there is a risk that some shipping lines may experience financial difficulty 
any resultant material increase in the level of bad debts could potentially impair the ability of the group to meet its operating commitments

on september   cronos established the joint venture program with a major international financial services provider  and a current lender to the company 
the purpose of the joint venture program is to acquire and lease to third party lessees marine cargo containers through a joint venture owned by a subsidiary of the company and owned by an affiliate of the bank 
the joint venture entity is a bankruptcy remote  special purpose company organized under the laws of bermuda 
the group sold approximately million of containers to the joint venture program and transferred an additional million of containers as a capital contribution 
the group utilized the proceeds from the sale of containers to repay approximately million of indebtedness outstanding under its existing revolving line of credit with the bank 
in addition  an initial distribution from the joint venture program of approximately million was utilized to further reduce the existing revolving line of credit with the bank 
the sale of the containers by the group to the joint venture program did not result in a material gain or loss

this facility was for a term of three years with an interest rate of london inter bank offered rate libor plus  payable monthly in arrears 
the first drawdown under the facility was utilized to refinance existing loan facilities and to fund new container additions 
in connection with the establishment of the joint venture program and the repayment of a portion of the outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility with the bank  the group has amended its revolving line of credit agreement with the bank to reduce the maximum commitment of the bank thereunder from million to million  and has agreed to amortize the balance outstanding under the revolving line of credit  as of september   over five years

sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposals activities 
the company does not consider the provisions of sfas to have any effect on the results from operations presented herein 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the method used to report results 
the company has already adopted the disclosure requirements under sfas  and will adopt the interim disclosure requirements from the first quarter of in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires i that for financial statements issued after the issuance of fin  certain disclosures be made by the guarantor in its financial statements and ii that for guarantees issued after december  a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
accounting for guarantees issued prior to the initial application of fin shall not be revised or restated to reflect the recognition or measurement provisions of fin in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the group has not yet completed the process of identifying whether it has variable interests in any variable interest entities 
the group is evaluating the impact that will result from adopting fin and is therefore unable to disclose the impact that adopting fin will have on its financial position and results of operation when such statement is adopted 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material adverse effect on the group s results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following table sets forth principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for debt and capital lease obligations at december  expected maturity date of debt and capital lease obligations and total thereafter us dollar equivalent  in thousands long term debt and capital lease obligations fixed rate us average interest rate variable rate us average interest rate interest rate risk outstanding borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
at december   of total borrowings had floating interest rates 
the group conducted an analysis of borrowings with variable interest rates to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this analysis  the same change was applied to the current balance outstanding  leaving all other factors constant 
it was found that if a increase were applied to market rates  the expected effect would be to reduce annual cash flows by million 
exchange rate risk in  over of the group s revenues were billed and paid in us dollars 
the group believes that the proportion of us dollar revenues may decrease in future years  reflecting a more diversified customer base and lease portfolio 
approximately of costs in were incurred and paid in us dollars 
of the remaining costs  approximately are individually small  unpredictable and were incurred in various denominations 
thus  such amounts are not suitable for cost effective hedging 
as exchange rates are outside of the control of the group  there can be no assurance that such fluctuations will not adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
by reference to  it is estimated that for every incremental decline in value of the us dollar against various foreign currencies  the effect would be to reduce cash flows by million in any given year
