overview we provide high speed data communications  internet access  and related services to small and medium sized businesses  primarily using digital subscriber line  or dsl  technology 
we primarily target select second and third tier cities  as well as some first tier cities  for the deployment of our own local dsl and t equipment 
we began offering commercial service in may and  as of march   we operated equipment in approximately cities 
in certain other markets where we have not deployed our own equipment  we utilize the local facilities of other carriers to provide service 
we have incurred operating losses and net losses for each month since our formation 
for the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash outflows from operating and investing activities 
as of december  and  we had accumulated deficits of approximately  and  respectively 
in an effort to increase revenue from our installed network and conserve capital  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to suspend the build out of additional central offices and focus our efforts on increasing revenue through targeted marketing to increase penetration in our existing service areas and by introducing more services 
in addition  in order to reduce costs  we i suspended network connections by shutting off the power and communication connections to approximately central offices  which were not being used to service customers at the time  ii consolidated operating facilities and vacated certain leased premises and iii significantly reduced staff 
we also began actively pursuing opportunities for additional equity financing 
near the end of the second quarter of  since we still had not received additional financing and were continuing to incur significant operating losses  we initiated further cost reduction actions including i additional reductions in force  ii closing our santa cruz office and vacating unused office space in our headquarters building and iii closing the non active central offices discussed above  together with approximately then active central offices  which required removal of our equipment and vacating the premises 
closure of the active central offices also required re routing a number of customers and ultimately resulted in our losing approximately customers  or approximately of our customer base 
we also had another significant staff reduction during the fourth quarter of all of the above described actions were designed to significantly reduce operating costs and cash outflows  but necessitated significant restructuring charges related to i closing of our central offices and resulting asset write offs  ii costs related to vacated facilities and iii severance costs 
in addition  we incurred impairment write offs of goodwill pertaining to our tycho and trusted net acquisitions 
these restructuring and impairment charges are more fully discussed below 
in november and december of  we were successful in securing additional equity financing from existing and new investor groups in accordance with two purchase agreements which provided for the sale of up to an aggregate of million in series x and y mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
in accordance with those purchase agreements  in november  we sold an aggregate of  shares of series x preferred stock and in december  we sold an additional  shares of series x preferred stock and  shares of series y preferred stock for gross proceeds of  before direct issuance costs 
in addition  during december  we issued promissory notes to the series y investors in the aggregate principal amount of  in exchange for proceeds of  the promissory notes provided for an annual interest rate of 
in march  in accordance with the terms of the series x purchase agreement  we sold an additional  shares of series x preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of  in may  in accordance with the terms of the series y purchase agreement  we sold  additional shares of series y preferred stock for net proceeds of  in cash and delivery of the promissory notes for cancellation 
in accordance with the terms of the series y purchase agreement  all accrued interest on the promissory notes  of approximately  was forgiven 
in december of  the us bankruptcy court for the district of delaware approved our bid to purchase network assets and associated subscriber lines of network access solutions corporation nas for  consisting of  in cash and  in a note payable to nas 
we closed the transaction on january   whereby we acquired the majority of nas s operations and network assets  associated equipment in approximately central offices and approximately  associated subscriber lines 
the cash portion of the purchase price was paid from our existing cash 
in connection with the closing of the nas transaction  on january   we hired approximately former nas employees 
no pre closing liabilities were assumed with the nas transaction 
we expect that the acquired nas assets and operations will have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in connection with the integration of the nas business  on january   we had a reduction in force of approximately employees at our headquarters facility in new haven  ct 
we paid approximately  in severance to the terminated employees 
subsequent to the reduction in force  our headcount approximated employees 
on february   we borrowed  under our revolving credit and term loan agreement discussed below 
the loan bears interest  payable monthly in arrears at the bank s base rate and any unpaid principal balance will automatically convert to a term loan on december   after which principal payments together with accrued interest on the unpaid principal balance will be made in equal installments payable at the end of each calendar quarter commencing on december  amounts borrowed under the bank credit line are guaranteed by the principal holders of our series x and series y preferred stock  with whom we have signed a reimbursement agreement discussed below 
in addition to our internal sales and marketing efforts  we have grown our customer base by acquiring end users of other internet service providers and companies offering broadband access 
we continuously identify and evaluate acquisition candidates  and in many cases engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions 
acquisition candidates include both subscriber lines and whole businesses 
our discussions and negotiations may not result in an acquisition 
further  if we make any acquisitions  we may not be able to operate any acquired assets or businesses profitably or otherwise successfully implement our expansion strategy 
we intend to continue to seek additional opportunities for further acquisitions  which we believe represents a distinct opportunity to accelerate our growth 
our independent accountants have noted in their report that our sustained operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash expected to be generated from operations  and funds available under our bank credit agreement  will be sufficient to fund our operating losses  capital expenditures  lease payments and working capital requirements into the third quarter of we intend to use our cash resources to finance our capital expenditures and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we may also use a portion of our cash resources to acquire complementary businesses  subscriber lines or other assets 
the amounts actually expended for these purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our services  revenue growth  planned capital expenditures  cash generated from operations  improvements in operating productivity  the extent and timing of entry into new markets and availability and prices paid for acquisitions 
additional financing will be required during we do not believe that our operations will generate sufficient cash to finance our requirements 
as a result  we will need to raise additional financing through some combination of borrowings  leasing  vendor financing and the sale of equity or debt securities 
these capital requirements may vary based upon the timing and the success of implementation of our business plan or if o demand for our services or our cash flow from operations is less than or more than expected  o our plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate  o we make acquisitions  o we alter the schedule or targets of our business plan implementation  or o we curtail  reorganize  discontinue or shut down our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional debt  equity or other capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds  we may not be able to continue to operate our network  respond to competitive pressures or fund our operations 
as a result  we may be required to significantly reduce  reorganize  discontinue or shut down our operations 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
our financial performance will vary  and when we achieve profitability or become cash flow positive will depend on a number of factors  including o development of the high speed data communications industry and our ability to compete effectively  o amount  timing and pricing of customer revenue  o availability  timing and pricing of acquisition opportunities  and our ability to capitalize on such opportunities  o commercial acceptance of our service and attaining expected penetration within our target markets  o our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  o up front sales and marketing expenses  o cost and utilization of our network components which we lease from other telecommunications providers  including other competitive carriers  o our ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners  o successful implementation and management of financial  information management and operations support systems to efficiently and cost effectively manage our growth  and o favorable outcome of federal and state regulatory proceedings and related judicial proceedings  including proceedings relating to the telecommunications act 
critical accounting policies  estimates and risks financial reporting release no 
 which was released in december  by the securities and exchange commission the sec  requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements and the estimates and judgments that are used by management in applying those accounting policies and methods 
in addition  financial reporting release no 
 which was released in december by the sec  requires all companies to include a discussion to address  among other things  liquidity  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including the recoverability of tangible and intangible assets  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the markets for our services are characterized by intense competition  rapid technological development  regulatory and legislative changes  and frequent new product introductions  all of which could impact the future value of our assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
the most significant estimates relate to revenue recognition  goodwill and other long lived assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods and the judgments and estimates used by us in their application 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements  which requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
revenue is recognized pursuant to the terms of each contract on a monthly service fee basis  which vary based on the speed of the customer s internet connection and the services ordered by the customer 
the monthly fee includes phone line charges  internet access charges  the cost of the equipment installed at the customer s site and the other services we provide  as applicable 
revenue that is billed in advance of the services provided is deferred until the services are rendered 
revenue related to installation charges is also deferred and amortized to revenue over months 
related direct costs incurred up to the amount of deferred revenue are also deferred and amortized to expense over months 
any excess direct costs over installation charges are charged to expense as incurred 
in certain instances  we negotiate credits and allowances for service related matters 
we establish a reserve for such credits based on historical experience 
we seek to price our services competitively 
the market for high speed data communications services and internet access is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
while many of our competitors and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us  we are pursuing a significant market that  we believe  is currently under served 
although pricing is an important part of our strategy  we believe that direct relationships with our customers and consistent  high quality service and customer support will be key to generating customer loyalty 
during the past several years  market prices for many telecommunications services and equipment have been declining  a trend that might continue 
goodwill and other long lived assets we account for our long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  which requires that long lived assets and certain intangible assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets  an impairment loss is to be recognized based on the fair value of the assets 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that the amortization of goodwill be discontinued and instead an impairment approach be applied 
the impairment tests were performed during the first and last quarters of and will be performed annually hereafter or more often if adverse events occur and are based upon a fair value approach rather than an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows 
if impairment exists  under sfas no 
 the resulting charge is determined by the recalculation of goodwill through a hypothetical purchase price allocation of the fair value and reducing the current carrying value to the extent it exceeds the recalculated goodwill 
we did not record any goodwill impairment adjustments resulting from our impairment reviews during other long lived assets  such as identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets  are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances provide evidence that suggests that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable  with impairment being based upon an evaluation of the identifiable undiscounted cash flow 
if impaired  the resulting charge reflects the excess of the asset s carrying cost over its fair value 
if market conditions become less favorable  future cash flows the key variable in assessing the impairment of these assets may decrease and as a result we may be required to recognize impairment charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we primarily sell our services directly to end users mainly consisting of small to medium sized businesses 
we believe that we do not have significant exposure or concentrations of credit risk with respect to any given customer  as no customer accounted for more than of annual revenues for the years ended december   or  respectively 
however  if the country or any region we service  experiences an economic downturn  the financial condition of our customers could be adversely affected  which could result in their inability to make payments to us 
this could require additional provisions for allowances 
in addition  a negative impact on revenue related to those customers may occur 
with the acquisition of the nas assets on january   we acquired a number of subscribers  some of whom we service indirectly through various internet service providers isp s 
we sell our services to such isp s who then resell such services to the end user subscriber 
we expect to have some increased exposure and concentration of credit risk pertaining to such isp s during  however  we currently expect that no single customer or isp will account for more than of annual revenues 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes  as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss carryforwards  all calculated using presently enacted tax rates 
we have not generated any taxable income to date and  therefore  have not paid any federal income taxes since inception 
our state and federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and  respectively 
use of our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant annual limitations resulting from a change in control due to our recent sales of series x and series y preferred stock 
we are currently assessing the potential impact resulting from these transactions 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset since management has not determined that these future benefits will more likely than not be realized 
litigation from time to time  we may be involved in litigation concerning claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including claims brought by former employees and claims related to acquisitions 
we record liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
these estimates are based on an analysis made by internal and external legal counsel who consider information known at the time 
we believe we have made reasonable estimates in the past  however  court decisions could cause liabilities to be incurred in excess of estimates 
results of operations the following table depicts our results of operations data and the components of net loss as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue operating expenses network excluding stock compensation operations excluding stock compensation general and administrative excluding stock compensation sales and marketing excluding stock compensation stock compensation depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating loss interest income expense  net other expense income  net net loss net loss applicable to common stockholders net loss dividends on preferred stock accretion of preferred stock net loss applicable to common stockholders revenue 
revenue is recognized pursuant to the terms of each contract on a monthly service fee basis  which varies based on the speed of the connection and the services ordered 
the monthly fee includes all phone line charges  internet access charges  the cost of the modem installed at the customer s site and the other services we provide  as applicable 
revenue that is billed in advance of the services provided is deferred until the services are rendered 
revenue related to installation charges is deferred and amortized to revenue over months 
revenue increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  and approximately  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenue increased primarily due to the expansion of our network  the increased number of customers subscribing for our services and contributions from acquisitions  primarily vector internet services  inc visi  tycho networks  inc 
tycho and certain assets and subscriber lines of exario networks  inc exario during  certain subscriber lines of covad communications  inc covad under their safety net program  and certain subscriber lines of zyan communications  inc zyan during and certain subscriber lines of broadslate networks  inc broadslate and abacus america  inc 
abacus during the revenue attributable to contributions from acquired businesses was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect revenue to increase in as a result of our acquisition of the nas assets and associated subscriber lines  and as we continue our sales and marketing efforts in our new expanded service areas  introduce additional services and  possibly  acquire additional businesses and or subscriber lines 
network expenses 
our network expenses include costs related to network engineering and network operations personnel  costs for telecommunications lines between customers  central offices  network service providers and our network  costs for rent and power at our central offices  costs to connect to the internet  costs of customer line installations and the costs of customer premise equipment when sold to our customers 
we expect our network expenses  including costs for subscriber lines  to increase as a result of our acquisition of the nas assets and associated subscriber lines and as we add customers 
we lease high speed lines and other network capacity to connect our central office equipment and our network 
in addition  costs incurred to connect to the internet are expected to increase as the volume of data communications traffic generated by our customers increases 
network expenses increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december   and then decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase in network expenses between and was primarily due to increased telecommunication expenses of approximately  due to the expansion of our network during and the increased number of customers subscribing for our services during and  which were partially offset by reductions of approximately  in salaries and benefits due to reductions in force  reductions of approximately  in professional and consulting services  and reductions of approximately  in travel and entertainment  recruiting costs  equipment and other expenses  resulting from our cost reduction initiatives 
reductions during were primarily attributable to decreased telecommunications expenses resulting from our restructuring and cost containment efforts during see restructuring and impairment charges 
operations expenses 
our operations expenses include costs related to customer care  customer provisioning  customer billing  customer technical assistance  purchasing  headquarters facilities operations  operating systems maintenance and support and other related overhead expenses 
we expect our operations expenses to increase in as a result of our acquisition of the nas assets and associated subscriber lines 
operations expenses increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december   and then decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase in operations expenses between and was primarily due to increases in restructuring charges explained below of approximately  which were partially offset by reductions of approximately  in salaries and benefits due to reductions in force  reductions of approximately  in professional and consulting services  reductions of approximately  in taxes and reductions of approximately  in travel and entertainment  recruiting costs and other expenses due to our cost containment efforts 
reductions during were primarily attributable to decreased expenses resulting from our cost containment efforts during these included reductions in restructuring charges of approximately  reductions of approximately  in salaries and benefits  reductions of approximately  in professional and consulting services  reductions of approximately  in equipment costs and reductions of approximately  in travel and entertainment and other expenses due to our cost containment efforts 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs relating to human resources  finance  executive  administrative services  recruiting  insurance  legal and auditing services  leased office facilities rent and bad debt expenses 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in as a result of our acquisition of the nas assets and associated subscriber lines 
general and administrative expenses increased from approximately  for the year ended december  to approximately  for the year ended december   and then decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  the increase from to was primarily attributable to increases of approximately  in restructuring and impairment charges discussed below and approximately  in bad debt expenses  which was partially offset by reductions of approximately  in facilities costs  professional and consulting services  recruiting costs and other expenses resulting from our cost reduction initiatives 
the increase in bad debt expenses was primarily due to i a significant increase in customers and associated revenue  ii increased write offs associated with customer line acquisitions and iii increased loss of customers due to our closure of approximately central offices and various brief outages and service interruptions in the latter part of  including service interruptions associated with the aftermath of the september th events 
reductions during in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to decreases resulting from our restructuring and cost containment efforts during and included reductions in restructuring and impairment charges of approximately  professional fees of approximately  salaries and benefits of approximately  sales  use  property and other taxes of approximately  as further discussed below  bad debt expense of approximately  and other expenses of approximately  these reductions were partially offset by increased insurance costs of approximately  in march  we filed an application with the connecticut department of revenue services for research and development expenditure credits for the and calendar years 
the credits were approved as a reduction against our corporation business tax 
with regard to credits approved for the calendar year  we were entitled to elect a cash refund at percent of the approved credit 
we elected to receive the calendar year credit as a cash refund of approximately  the calendar year credit of approximately  is available as a carryforward offset to future state of connecticut business taxes 
in july of  we received the first installment of the cash refund pertaining to the calendar year of approximately  with the  balance payable in two equal installments in july and upon receipt of the research and development credits  we were obligated to pay approximately  to a professional service provider as a result of a contingent fee arrangement for professional services in connection with obtaining such credits 
for the year ended december   we recorded the  refund as a reduction in our state corporate franchise tax expenses which are included in general and administrative expenses  and the  contingent fee as professional services expenses  also included in general and administrative expenses 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of expenses for personnel  the development of our brand name  promotional materials  direct mail advertising and sales commissions and incentives 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in as a result of our acquisition of the nas assets and associated subscriber lines 
sales and marketing expenses decreased from approximately  for the year ended december   to approximately  and approximately  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
reductions during were primarily due to approximately  in lower salaries and benefits due to reductions in force  approximately  in lower marketing and advertising costs  approximately  in lower professional and consulting services costs  approximately  in lower travel and entertainment costs  approximately  in lower recruiting costs and approximately  in lower office and other expenses 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses during was primarily due to decreased costs that resulted from our restructuring and cost containment efforts during  including reductions in advertising and direct mail marketing expenses of approximately  salaries and benefits of approximately  professional and consulting services of approximately  and other expenses of approximately  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is primarily attributable to the following i depreciation of network and operations equipment and company owned modems and routers installed at customer sites  ii depreciation of information systems and computer hardware and software  iii amortization and depreciation of the costs of obtaining  designing and building our collocation space and corporate facilities and iv amortization of intangible capitalized costs pertaining to acquired businesses and customer line acquisitions 
we expect our depreciation and amortization expenses to increase in as a result of our acquisition of the nas network assets and associated subscriber lines 
depreciation and amortization expenses were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
increases in such expenses during primarily resulted from the significant expansion of our network and infrastructure and acquired businesses during  partially offset by reduced depreciation and amortization in from assets written off due to our restructuring and impairment provisions discussed below 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during primarily resulted from restructuring write offs of central office equipment and impairment write offs of intangible assets taken during during december and calendar year  we wrote off approximately million of network equipment and other capitalized costs as part of our restructuring efforts  and incurred approximately million in impairment charges pertaining to goodwill of acquired companies see restructuring and impairment charges 
also  in accordance with sfas no 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements  discussed below  we discontinued amortization of goodwill beginning january   and completed an impairment review during the first and last quarters of we did not record any impairment adjustments resulting from these impairment reviews and will continue to make annual reviews  unless a change in circumstances requires a review in the interim 
consequently  amortization expense related to our goodwill was approximately  higher for the year ended december  than for the year ended december  depreciation expense pertaining to assets for our network and operations was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expenses pertaining to assets related to general and administrative expenses was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
stock compensation 
we incurred non cash stock compensation expenses as a result of the granting of stock and stock options to employees  directors and members of our former board of advisors with exercise prices per share subsequently determined to be below the fair values per share of our common stock for financial reporting purposes at the dates of grant 
the stock compensation  if vested  was charged immediately to expense  while non vested compensation is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options or stock  which is generally months 
unvested options for terminated employees are cancelled and the value of such options are recorded as a reduction of deferred compensation with an offset to additional paid in capital 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded  of non cash compensation expense relating to the vesting of stock options held by members of our former advisory board 
non cash stock compensation expenses were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the unamortized balance as of december  and  of approximately  and  respectively  is being amortized over the remaining vesting period of each grant  and is expected to be fully amortized by june  as of december  and  options to purchase  and  shares of common stock  respectively  were outstanding  which were exercisable at weighted average exercise prices of and per share  respectively 
interest income expense  net 
for the year ended december   net interest income of approximately  included  of interest income partially offset by  of interest expense 
net interest income of approximately  for the year ended december  included  of interest income  partially offset by  of interest expense 
for the year ended december   net interest expense of approximately  included approximately  in interest expense  partially offset by  in interest income 
the decrease in interest income in and was caused by lower interest rates on significantly lower cash and investment balances 
lower interest expense in and was caused by reductions in debt and capital lease obligations 
we expect interest expense to increase in due to our incurrence of increased debt associated with the acquisition of the nas assets and associated subscriber lines  and borrowings under our bank credit line 
restructuring and impairment charges 
in december  we initiated a new business plan strategy designed to conserve our capital  reduce our losses and extend our cash resources 
this strategy included the following actions i further network expansion was curtailed  ii network connections to central offices were suspended  iii certain facilities were vacated and consolidated  iv operating expenses were reduced  and v headcount was reduced by approximately employees 
these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of approximately  the components of the restructuring charge were i approximately  relating to severence expense for the employees  ii approximately  for estimated costs resulting from the consolidation of our office facilities by vacating office space located in milford  connecticut  santa cruz  california  atlanta  georgia and chantilly  virginia  and iii approximately  for termination costs and write offs associated with our decision to not accept certain central office collocation applications previously applied for  and to forego the completion of our build out of certain other central offices 
at december   approximately  of severance costs and approximately  of capitalized collocation application fees had been charged against the restructuring reserves 
the remaining reserve balance of approximately  was included in our accrued liabilities at december  in march  we re evaluated our restructuring reserve and booked an increase in the reserve of approximately  which was primarily related to delays in subleasing our vacated facilities and additional estimated costs pertaining to our suspended central offices 
in june  due to the lack of liquidity in the financial markets  we further re evaluated our business plans and determined that additional actions were necessary to further reduce our operating losses  cash burn rate and total funding requirements 
these actions included i closure of approximately non active and active central offices  and ii an additional reduction in force of approximately employees 
these actions resulted in additional restructuring and impairment charges of approximately  included in this amount were i approximately  relating to severance expenses for the employees  ii approximately  for the costs associated with the our decision to close central offices  which includes approximately  relating to termination and equipment removal fees and approximately  in write off of fixed assets  iii approximately  for additional estimated costs resulting from delays and expected losses in subleasing vacated office space located in santa cruz  california  atlanta  georgia  milford  connecticut  and chantilly  virginia  iv  for write downs of additional equipment no longer in use  and v  for impairments of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment analysis was accomplished by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the expected future net cash flows generated over the remaining useful life of the assets 
since the carrying value was more than the expected future net cash flows  the goodwill was reduced to the net present value of the expected future net cash flows 
of this amount   related to a reduction in the goodwill for our acquisition of tycho networks  inc tycho and  related to a reduction in the goodwill for our acquisition of certain assets of trusted net media holdings  llc trusted net 
these reductions in goodwill resulted in decreases in monthly amortization expense from approximately  to approximately  for tycho  and from approximately  to approximately  for trusted net 
during the third quarter  due to limited available financing for our operations and other factors  we again re evaluated our business plans and determined that additional actions were necessary to further reduce our operating losses  cash burn rate and total funding requirements 
these actions included closure of the tycho and trusted net facilities in santa cruz  ca and atlanta  ga  respectively  and our decision not to install equipment in new central offices 
these actions resulted in additional restructuring and impairment charges of approximately  included in this amount were i increases of approximately  relating to the write off of equipment  ii approximately  for additional estimated costs relating to the delays and losses in subleasing vacated office space located in santa cruz  california and milford  connecticut  iii approximately  in additional costs for equipment removal fees associated with our previous decision to close certain central offices  and iv approximately  for impairments of goodwill 
these increases in the restructuring reserve were partially offset by a reduction of approximately  in previously reserved amounts relating to estimated termination fees associated with our previous decision to close certain central offices  as we were successful in negotiating significantly reduced fees at many of the closed central office locations 
the goodwill impairment analysis was accomplished by comparing the carrying value of the assets with the expected future net cash flows generated over the remaining useful life of the assets 
as a result of this analysis  expected future net cash flows were determined to be insignificant and  as the carrying value was more than these expected future net cash flows  the balance of goodwill was written off 
of this amount  approximately  related to a reduction in the goodwill for the acquisition of tycho and approximately  related to a reduction in the goodwill for our acquisition of certain assets of trusted net 
during the fourth quarter  we had an additional reduction in force of approximately employees 
this resulted in an additional restructuring charge for severance of approximately  which was partially offset by a reduction of approximately  in previously reserved amounts related to the write down of certain fixed assets 
in addition  we re classified amounts previously reserved for equipment removal to estimated termination fees as we were successful in negotiating reduced fees for equipment removal at many of the closed central office locations 
in addition  our impairment analyses of long lived assets resulted in a  impairment write off of a long term investment

the remaining reserve balance of approximately  was included in our accrued liabilities at december  the restructuring reserve additions for the year ended december  of approximately  included approximately  in network and operations expenses  approximately  in general and administrative expenses  and approximately  in sales and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
the remaining reserve balance of approximately  was included in our accrued liabilities at december  there were no additions to restructuring reserves for the year ended december  the remaining restructuring reserve balance at december   of approximately  was included in our accrued liabilities and represents approximately  for anticipated costs pertaining to our vacated facilities and approximately  for anticipated costs pertaining to our closed central offices which we have been disputing 
net loss 
net loss of approximately  for the year ended december  increased to approximately  for the year ended december  and then decreased to approximately  for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our capital expenditures and operations primarily with the proceeds from the sale of stock and from borrowings  including equipment lease financings 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  and working capital of approximately  net cash provided by financing activities in the years ended december   and  was approximately   and  respectively 
this cash primarily resulted from the sale of our capital stock 
we have used  and intend to continue using  the proceeds from these financings primarily to implement our business plan and for working capital and general corporate purposes

the development and expansion of our business has required significant capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including collocation fees  were approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the actual amounts and timing of our future capital expenditures will vary depending on the speed at which we expand our network and implement service for our customers 
as a result of our decision to suspend further deployment of our network  our planned capital expenditures for are currently expected to be primarily for the purchase and installation at our customers sites of the equipment necessary for us to provide our services  as well as for the continued development of our network and operational support systems 
we currently anticipate spending approximately  to  for capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  during the year ending december  the actual amounts and timing of our capital expenditures could differ materially both in amount and timing from our current plans 
our independent accountants have noted in their report that our sustained operating losses raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern

the amounts actually expended for these purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors  including market acceptance of our services  revenue growth  planned capital expenditures  cash generated from operations  improvements in operating productivity  the extent and timing of entry into new markets and availability and prices paid for acquisitions 
additional financing will be required during we do not believe that our operations will generate sufficient cash to finance our requirements 
as a result  we will need to raise additional financing through some combination of borrowings  leasing  vendor financing and the sale of equity or debt securities 
these capital requirements may vary based upon the timing and the success of implementation of the our business plan or if o demand for our services or our cash flow from operations is less than or more than expected  o our plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate  o we make acquisitions  o we alter the schedule or targets of our business plan implementation  or o we curtail  reorganize  discontinue or shut down our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional debt  equity or other capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds  we may not be able to continue to operate our network  respond to competitive pressures or fund our operations 
as a result  we may be required to significantly reduce  reorganize  discontinue or shut down our operations 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
our financial performance will vary  and when we achieve profitability or become cash flow positive will depend on a number of factors  including o development of the high speed data communications industry and our ability to compete effectively  o amount  timing and pricing of customer revenue  o availability  timing and pricing of acquisition opportunities  and our ability to capitalize on such opportunities  o commercial acceptance of our service and attaining expected penetration within our target markets  o our ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel  o up front sales and marketing expenses  o cost and utilization of our network components which we lease from other telecommunications providers  including other competitive carriers  o our ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners  o successful implementation and management of financial  information management and operations support systems to efficiently and cost effectively manage our growth  and o favorable outcome of federal and state regulatory proceedings and related judicial proceedings  including proceedings relating to the telecommunications act

this explanatory paragraph includes the following language the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
as discussed in note to the financial statements  the company has have experienced sustained operating losses that raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern 
management s plans in regard to these matters are also described in note the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
the inclusion of this explanatory paragraph in the report of our independent accountants may have an adverse impact on our ability to raise additional capital and on our stock price 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue as a going concern 
because the high speed data communications industry is new and rapidly evolving  we cannot predict its future growth or ultimate size the high speed data communications industry is in the early stages of development and is subject to rapid and significant technological change 
since this industry is new and because the technologies available for high speed data communications services are rapidly evolving  we cannot accurately predict the rate at which the market for our services will grow  if at all  or whether emerging technologies will render our services less competitive or obsolete 
if the market for our services fails to develop or grows more slowly than anticipated  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
many providers of high speed data communication services are testing products from numerous suppliers for various applications 
our business model is unproven  and may not be successful we do not know whether our business model and strategy will be successful 
if the assumptions underlying our business model are not valid or we are unable to implement our business plan  achieve the predicted level of market penetration or obtain the desired level of pricing of our services for sustained periods  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we have adopted a different strategy than certain other broadband internet service providers and dsl providers 
we focus on selling directly to small and medium sized businesses 
our unproven business model makes it difficult to predict the extent to which our services will achieve market acceptance 
it is possible that our efforts will not result in significant market penetration  favorable operating results or profitability 
if our services fail to achieve or sustain market acceptance at desired pricing levels  our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow would be impaired prices for digital communication services have fallen historically 
accordingly  we cannot predict to what extent we may need to reduce our prices to remain competitive or whether we will be able to sustain future pricing levels as our competitors introduce competing services or similar services at lower prices 
if our services fail to achieve or sustain market acceptance at desired pricing levels  our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow would be impaired  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to risks associated with acquisitions we may not be able to compete successfully for acquisition opportunities  operate the acquired assets or businesses profitably or otherwise implement successfully our acquisition strategy 
we have made a number of asset and business acquisitions 
we intend to continue to seek additional opportunities for further acquisitions  which we believe represents a distinct market opportunity to accelerate growth 
we continuously identify and evaluate acquisition candidates and in many cases engage in discussions and negotiations regarding potential acquisitions 
our discussions and negotiations may not result in any acquisitions 
there is significant competition for acquisition opportunities in our business 
as the consolidation in our industry continues  this competition may intensify and increase the costs of capitalizing on such opportunities 
we compete for acquisition opportunities with companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
also  all or part of the purchase price of any future acquisition may be paid in cash  thus depleting our cash resources 
in addition  an acquisition  including our recent acquisition of assets and operations of network access solutions corporation  may not produce the revenue  earnings  cash flows or business synergies that we anticipate  and an acquired asset or business might not perform as we anticipated 
any such event may delay the time at which we expect to achieve profitability or positive cash flows 
further  if we pursue any future acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition and may be distracted from the operation of our business 
we will also have to devote a significant amount of management resources to integrating any acquired businesses  including the recently acquired network access solutions operations  with our existing operations  and that may not be successful 
our management team is critical and the loss of key personnel could adversely affect our business we depend on a small number of executive officers and other members of senior management to work effectively as a team  to execute our business strategy and business plan  and to manage employees located in several locations across the united states 
the loss of key managers or their failure to work effectively as a team could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers  so any of these individuals may terminate employment at any time 
our failure to maintain the necessary infrastructure to support our business and to manage our growth could strain our resources and adversely affect our business and financial performance we have had significant growth in the number of markets in which we provide service and the number of customers subscribing for our services 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our management  financial controls  operations  personnel and other resources 
we have deployed operations support systems to help manage customer service  bill customers  process customer orders and coordinate with vendors and contractors 
subsequent integration and enhancement of these systems could be delayed or cause disruptions in service or billing 
to efficiently and cost effectively manage our geographically dispersed business  we must continue to successfully implement these systems on a timely basis  and continually expand and upgrade these systems as our operations expand 
if we fail to retain our employees or recruit qualified personnel in a timely manner  we will not be able to execute our business plan and our business will be harmed to execute our business plan  we need to hire and retain qualified personnel  particularly sales and marketing  engineering and other technical personnel 
if we are unable to retain our employees or recruit qualified personnel in a timely manner  we will not be able to execute our business plan 
the reductions in workforce that we made in  and  and the competitive nature of our industry  may make it difficult to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis and to retain our employees 
disappointing quarterly revenue  operating results or operating statistics could cause the price of our common stock to fall our quarterly revenue  operating results and operating statistics are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
if our quarterly revenue  operating results or operating statistics fall below the expectations of investors or security analysts  the price of our common stock could fall substantially 
our quarterly revenue  operating results and operating statistics may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  including o the timing and success of acquisitions  if any  o the timing of the rollout of our services and any additional infrastructure  and the amount and timing of expenditures relating thereto  o regulatory developments  o the rate at which we are able to attract customers and our ability to retain these customers at sufficient aggregate revenue levels  o the availability of financing  o technical difficulties or network service interruptions  and o the introduction of new services or technologies by our competitors and resulting pressures on the pricing of our service 
the failure of our customers to pay their bills on a timely basis could adversely affect our cash flow our target customers consist mostly of small and medium sized businesses 
we bill and collect numerous relatively small customer accounts 
we may experience difficulty in collecting amounts due on a timely basis 
in addition  with the acquisition of the network access solutions business on january   we acquired a number of subscribers whom we service indirectly through various internet service providers 
we sell our services to such internet service providers who then resell such services 
we therefore expect to have increased exposure and concentration of credit risk pertaining to such internet service providers during and beyond 
our failure to collect accounts receivable owed to us by our customers on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and cash flow 
we depend on wholesale dsl and t providers  some of whom are competitors  to provide us with local facilites in areas where we have not deployed our own equipment in markets where we have not deployed our own local dsl and t equipment  we utilize local facilities from wholesale providers  including covad communications  in order to provide service to our end user customers 
in these cases  we are dependent upon these wholesale carriers to provide  or arrange the provision of  the equipment and on site wiring required to provide local dsl or t services to our end user customers  as well as to provide and maintain the local dsl or t line 
in general  these carriers may terminate the service they provide to us with little or no notice 
these carriers may not continue to provide us with acceptable local services for our customers on the scale  at the price levels and within the time frames we require  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain acceptable services from these wholesale carriers or they terminate the service they provide us  we may be required to install our own equipment in a central office and provide and install new equipment for our customers  or arrange for another wholesale carrier to do so 
obtaining space and provisioning equipment in a new central office is a lengthy and costly process 
we cannot assure you that we  or another carrier with whom we work  would be able to obtain the space required in a central office on a cost effective basis  if at all  or that we could provide services to such customers on a timely basis 
our failure to install and provide services to customers on a timely basis  or the disruption in the services provided to our customers  would likely result in the loss of many  if not all  of the customers in the affected locations  and could result in claims brought by these customers against us 
this could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  business  results of operations  financial position and prospects 
certain wholesale providers with whom we work offer services that compete with ours  or have other customers whose services compete with ours 
such competing interests may affect the ability or willingness of these providers to provide us with acceptable services on acceptable terms 
in addition  certain of these providers are relatively young companies that are facing substantial operational and financial challenges 
the operational success and abilities of these carriers to operate their businesses could materially affect our business 
the failure of any of these companies could cause us to lose customers and revenue  expose us to claims and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  business  results of operations  financial position and prospects 
our services are subject to federal  state and local regulation  and changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect the way we operate our business the facilities we use and the services we offer are subject to varying degrees of regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
changes in applicable laws or regulations could  among other things  increase our costs  restrict our access to the network elements and central offices of the traditional local telephone companies  or restrict our ability to provide our services 
for example  the telecommunications act  which  among other things  requires traditional local telephone companies to unbundle network elements and to allow competitors to locate their equipment in the traditional local telephone companies central offices  is the subject of ongoing proceedings at the federal and state levels  litigation in federal and state courts  and legislation in federal and state legislatures 
for example  the fcc voted in february to amend its regulations in many key respects that could have a significant adverse impact on our business  and it is also considering substantial reductions or even elimination of the obligation of the traditional local telephone companies to provide network elements to competitors such as us for use for high speed data services 
pending or expected legislative proposals in congress and state legislatures could  if adopted  also have the effect of reducing the obligations of the traditional local telephone companies on which we rely 
adoption of this legislation  or of some of the regulatory changes being considered by the fcc  could have severe adverse consequences for our business 
we cannot predict the outcome of the various proceedings  litigation and legislation or whether or to what extent these proceedings  litigation and legislation may adversely affect our business and operations 
decisions by the fcc and state telecommunications regulators will determine some of the terms of our relationships with traditional telecommunications carriers  including the terms and prices of interconnection agreements  and access fees and surcharges on gross revenue from interstate and intrastate services 
state telecommunications regulators determine whether and on what terms we will be authorized to operate as a competitive local exchange carrier in their state 
in addition  local municipalities may require us to obtain various permits that could increase the cost of services or delay development of our network 
future federal  state and local regulations and legislation may be less favorable to us than current regulations and legislation and may adversely affect our businesses and operations 
see item business governmental regulations 
our success depends on negotiating and entering into interconnection agreements with traditional local telephone companies we must enter into and renew interconnection agreements with traditional local telephone companies in each market in which we deploy our own dsl equipment 
these agreements govern  among other things  the price and other terms regarding our location of equipment in the offices of the traditional local telephone companies  known as central offices  and our lease of copper telephone lines that connect those central offices to our customers 
we have entered into agreements with bellsouth  cincinnati bell  frontier  sbc communications  qwest  sprint  verizon or their subsidiaries  which govern our relationships in states and the district of columbia 
delays in obtaining or renewing interconnection agreements would delay our entrance into new markets and could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
in addition  disputes have arisen  and will likely arise in the future  regarding the interpretation of these interconnection agreements 
these disputes have  in the past  delayed the deployment of our network 
our interconnection agreements generally have limited terms of one to two years and we cannot assure you that new agreements will be negotiated on a timely basis  if at all  or that existing agreements will be extended on terms favorable to us 
interconnection agreements must be approved by state regulators and are also subject to oversight by the fcc and the courts 
these governmental authorities may modify the terms or prices of our interconnection agreements in ways that could adversely affect our ability to deliver service and our business and results of operations 
failure to negotiate interconnection agreements with the traditional local telephone companies could lead to costly and lengthy arbitration which may not be resolved in our favor under federal law  traditional local telephone companies have an obligation to negotiate with us in good faith to enter into interconnection agreements 
if no agreement can be reached  either side may petition the applicable state telecommunications regulators to arbitrate remaining disagreements 
arbitration is a costly and lengthy process that could delay our entry into markets and could harm our ability to compete 
interconnection agreements resulting from arbitration must be approved by state regulators 
we cannot assure you that a state regulatory authority would resolve disputes in our favor 
our success depends on traditional local telephone companies providing acceptable transmission facilities and copper telephone lines we interconnect with and use the networks of traditional local telephone companies to provide services to our customers in the markets where we have deployed our own dsl equipment 
in markets where we utilize the local dsl facilities of other carriers to provide our service  those carriers must interconnect with and use the networks of traditional local telephone companies to provide this service 
we cannot assure you that these networks will be able to meet the telecommunications needs of our customers or maintain our service standards 
we also depend on the traditional local telephone companies to provide and maintain their transmission facilities and the copper telephone lines between our network and our customers premises 
the fcc s decision in february to exempt the traditional local telephone companies from their obligation to provide access to certain loop transmission facilities that use fiber or new technologies to competitors such as us may incent the traditional local telephone companies to modify  characterize or replace their facilities in ways that would qualify them for this exemption and thereby preclude us from accessing these facilities 
our dependence on traditional local telephone companies could cause delays in establishing our network and providing our services 
any such delays could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we  or the other carriers with which we work  lease copper telephone lines running from the central office of the traditional local telephone companies to each customer s location 
in many cases  the copper telephone lines must be specially conditioned by the telephone company to carry digital signals 
we may not be able to obtain a sufficient number of acceptable telephone lines on acceptable terms  if at all 
traditional telephone companies often rely on unionized labor and labor related issues have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect the services provided by the traditional telephone companies 
we compete with the traditional local telephone companies on which we depend most of the traditional local telephone companies  including those created by at t s divestiture of its local telephone service business  offer dsl based services 
in addition  these companies also currently offer high speed data communications services that use other technologies  including t services 
consequently  these companies have certain incentives to delay o our entry into  and renewals of  interconnection agreements with them  o our access to their central offices to install our equipment and provide our services  o providing acceptable transmission facilities and copper telephone lines  and o our introduction and expansion of our services 
any such delays would negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan and harm our competitive position  business and prospects 
in addition  the other carriers whose local facilities we utilize in markets where we have not deployed our own equipment also compete with the traditional local telephone companies and rely on these companies for the same facilities and services that we do 
any delay in the provision of acceptable transmission facilities and copper telephone lines provided by the traditional local telephone companies to these carriers which are used in the provision of our service could negatively impact our ability to implement our business plan and harm our competitive position  business and prospects 
competition from the traditional local telephone companies offering dsl  t or other competitive high speed data communications services in a specific market may adversely impact our ability to obtain customers in that area and harm our competitive position  business and prospects 
these companies have established brand names and reputations for high quality in their service areas  possess sufficient capital to deploy broadband equipment rapidly  have their own copper telephone lines and can bundle digital data services with their existing voice services to achieve a competitive advantage in serving customers 
in addition  we depend upon these traditional local telephone companies to provide us access to their central offices and to individual elements of their networks 
as a result  they can significantly influence the actual and perceived reliability  quality and timeliness of our services in their service areas 
the perceived relative stability of the traditional local telephone companies  particularly in light of the failure of certain competitive telephone companies and the financial and operational issues surrounding other such companies  provides the traditional local telephone companies a significant competitive advantage 
we depend on long distance carriers to connect our network data is transmitted across our network via transmission facilities that we lease from long distance carriers  including worldcom and at t 
failure of these carriers to provide service or to provide quality service may interrupt the use of our services by our customers 
the service provided by these carriers has been interrupted in the past  which has affected the services we provide to our customers 
we cannot be sure that this service will not be interrupted in the future 
in addition  worldcom has filed a voluntary petition to reorganize under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
while worldcom has continued with its current operations since filing its voluntary petition to reorganize in june  and has announced that it expects to continue with its current operations without adverse impact on its customers  it may not be able to do so 
we believe that we could transition the data transport services currently supplied by worldcom to alternative suppliers in thirty to sixty days  should worldcom announce discontinuance of such services 
however  were worldcom to discontinue such services without providing sufficient advance notice at least sixty days  we might not be able to transition such services in a timely manner  which could disrupt service provided by us to certain of our customers 
this could result in the loss of revenue  loss of customers  claims brought against us by our customers  or could otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 
even were worldcom to provide adequate notice of any such discontinuation of service  there can be no assurance that we would be able to transition such service without a material adverse impact on us or our customers  if at all  or that such discontinuation of service would not otherwise have a material adverse effect on us 
intense competition in the high speed data communication services market may negatively affect the number of our customers and the pricing of our services the high speed data communication services market is intensely competitive 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we expect the level of competition to intensify in the future  due  in part  to increasing consolidation in our industry 
our competitors use various high speed communications technologies for local access connections such as integrated services digital network  or isdn  frame relay  t  dsl services and wireless  satellite based and cable networks 
we expect significant competition from o other providers of dsl and t services  including covad communications  speakeasy  inc and new edge networks  o internet service providers  such as uunet  earthlink and megapath  which offer high speed access capabilities  as well as other related products and services  o traditional local telephone companies  including the traditional local telephone companies created by at t s divestiture of its local telephone service business  which deploy dsl and t services and which provide other high speed data communications services  o national long distance carriers  such as at t  sprint  williams and worldcom  some of which are offering competitive dsl and t services and other high speed data communications services  o cable modem service providers  such as at t  comcast and rcn  which are offering high speed internet access over cable networks  and o providers utilizing alternative technologies  such as wireless and satellite based data service providers 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  technical  marketing  management  service support and other resources than we do 
therefore  they may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities  technologies  standards or customer requirements 
see item business competition 
our failure to develop and maintain good relationships with marketing partners in a local service market could adversely affect our ability to obtain and retain customers in that market in addition to marketing through our direct sales force  we rely on relationships with local marketing partners  such as integrators of computer systems and networks and consultants 
these partners recommend our services to their clients  provide us with referrals and help us build a local presence in each market 
we may not be able to identify  and maintain good relationships with  quality marketing partners and we cannot assure you that they will recommend our services rather than our competitors services to their customers 
our failure to identify and maintain good relationships with quality marketing partners could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and retain customers in a market and  as a result  our business would suffer 
uncertain tax and other surcharges on our services may increase our payment obligations to federal and state governments telecommunications providers are subject to a variety of federal and state surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services 
these surcharges and fees may be increased and other surcharges and fees not currently applicable to our services could be imposed on us 
in either case  the cost of our services would increase and that could have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and results of operations 
a system failure could delay or interrupt service to our customers our operations depend upon our ability to support a highly complex network infrastructure and avoid damage from fires  earthquakes  floods  power losses  excessive sustained or peak user demand  telecommunications failures  network software flaws  computer worms and viruses  transmission cable cuts and similar events 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated interruption of service at our owned or leased facilities could cause interruptions in our services 
in addition  failure of a traditional telephone company  competitive telecommunications company or other service provider to provide communications capacity or other services that we require  as a result of a natural disaster  operational disruption or any other reason  could cause interruptions in our services 
any damage or failure that causes sustained interruptions in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a breach of our network security could result in liability to us and deter customers from using our services our network may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses and other disruptive problems 
any of the foregoing problems could result in liability to us and deter customers from using our service 
unauthorized access could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in the computer systems of our customers 
eliminating computer viruses and alleviating other security problems may require interruptions  delays or cessation of service to our customers  cause us to incur significant costs to remedy the problem  and divert management s attention 
we can provide no assurance that the security measures we have implemented will not be circumvented or that any failure of these measures will not have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and retain customers 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
our failure to adequately protect our proprietary rights may adversely affect our business we rely on unpatented trade secrets and know how to maintain our competitive position 
our inability to protect these secrets and know how could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects 
we protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants and business partners 
these agreements may be breached or terminated 
in addition  third parties  including our competitors  may assert infringement claims against us 
any such claims could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  and require us to pay damages and or to enter into license or similar agreements under which we could be required to pay license fees or royalties 
we may be exposed to liability for information carried over our network or displayed on web sites that we host because we provide connections to the internet and host web sites for our customers  we may be perceived as being associated with the content carried over our network or displayed on web sites that we host 
we do not and cannot screen all of this content 
as a result  we may face potential liability for defamation  negligence  copyright  patent or trademark infringement and other claims based on the content carried over our network or displayed on web sites that we host 
these types of claims have been brought against providers of online services in the past and can be costly to defend regardless of the merit of the lawsuit 
the protection offered by recent federal legislation that protects online services from some claims when the material is written by third parties is limited 
further  the law in this area remains in flux and varies from state to state 
we may also suffer a loss of customers or reputational harm based on this content or resulting from our involvement in these legal proceedings 
we may incur significant amounts of debt in the future to implement our business plan and  if incurred  this indebtedness will create greater financial and operating risk and limit our flexibility we established a  revolving line of credit in december availability of funds under this line is subject to the receipt by the bank of certain third party guarantees 
as of march   we had borrowed an aggregate of  under this line 
the terms of this line and certain agreements we entered into with guarantors of amounts borrowed under this line contain provisions that could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and place other restrictions on our business 
we may seek additional debt financing in the future 
we may not be able to repay any current or future debt 
if we incur additional debt  we will be required to devote increased amounts of our cash flow to service indebtedness 
this could require us to modify  delay or abandon the capital expenditures and other investments necessary to implement our business plan 
risks relating to ownership of our common stock our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to factors such as the following o actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results or operating statistics  o announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors or new competing technologies  o the addition or loss of customers  o changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  o conditions or trends in the telecommunications industry  including regulatory or legislative developments  o growth of internet and on line commerce usage and the internet and on line commerce industries  o announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  o additions or departures of our key personnel  o future equity or debt financings by us or our announcements of such financings  and o general market and economic conditions 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the market for internet  technology and telecommunications companies in particular  have experienced large price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these market and industry factors may materially and adversely affect our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 
our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  which may have a material adverse impact on the pricing and trading of our common stock on july   the nasdaq transferred the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
on october   nasdaq notified us that  while we had not regained compliance by october  with the bid price per share requirement generally required for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  we did continue to meet the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market under rule c a 
as a result  we had an additional calendar days  or until april   to comply with the minimum bid price of per share for consecutive trading days  or such greater number of trading days as nasdaq may determine  in order to remain listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
on march   the nasdaq amended its rules to provide that a company that satisfies the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market under rule c a would have an additional days over the days already contemplated by the nasdaq smallcap market rules to comply with the minimum bid price of per share 
as a result  if we do not satisfy the minimum bid price of per share on april   but satisfy the nasdaq smallcap market initial listing requirements  we will have until july  to satisfy the minimum bid price of per share 
as of march   we satisfied the initial listing requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market  but there can be no assurance that we will satisfy these requirements on april  if we can neither comply with the minimum bid price requirements nor satisfy the initial nasdaq smallcap listing requirements on april   nasdaq will provide us notice that our common stock will be de listed from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition  we if satisfy the initial nasdaq smallcap listing requirements on april  but are unable to satisfy the minimum bid price requirements by july   nasdaq will provide us notice that our common stock will be de listed from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in each case  we would have the opportunity to appeal such determination to a listings qualifications panel 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to comply with the minimum bid price requirement by april  or july   if at all  or that we will continue to satisfy the other listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
nasdaq has indicated that it intends to submit proposed rules changes to the sec which would  among other things  further extend the number of days during which a company that satisfies the initial listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market may continue to be listed on such market without complying with the minimum bid price requirement 
there can be no assurance that nasdaq will submit this proposed rule change to the sec or that the sec will approve this proposed rule change  if at all  in time to delay the possible delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the initial listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our common stock is delisted by the nasdaq  it will become more difficult to trade or to obtain accurate and timely quotations to trade our common stock 
furthermore  any delisting of our common stock could depress our stock price or result in a decline in the trading market of our common stock 
a stockholder group controls most matters requiring stockholder approval  which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
a group of private investment funds affiliated with vantagepoint venture partners owns of record approximately of our outstanding common stock  of our outstanding series x preferred stock and of the combined voting power of all issued and outstanding dsl 
net capital stock as of march  as long as at least of the series x preferred stock owned by vantagepoint remains outstanding  the holders of the series x preferred stock are entitled to elect a majority of our board of directors  subject to the provisions of a stockholders agreement relating to the election of directors 
as a result  subject to the special voting rights of our series y preferred stock and the provisions of the stockholders agreement  vantagepoint can control most matters requiring stockholder approval  including approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  preventing or deterring a change in control  could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale and might affect the market price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our charter  by laws and delaware law could make a takeover difficult our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a third party takeover 
these provisions include a staggered board of directors  limitations on persons authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders  advance notice procedures required for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders  and the right of the holders of series x preferred stock to elect a majority of our directors 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in control by a third party or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common stock as part of a sale
