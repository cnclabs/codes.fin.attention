general dialysis corporation of america provides dialysis services  primarily kidney dialysis treatments through outpatient dialysis centers  including one in which it holds a minority interest and one unaffiliated dialysis facility which it manages 
our company also provides dialysis treatments to dialysis patients of nine hospitals and medical centers through acute inpatient dialysis services agreements 
we also provide homecare services  including home peritoneal dialysis and method ii services  the latter relating to providing patients with supplies and equipment 
dialysis corporation of america also provides ancillary services associated with dialysis treatments  primarily the administration of epo 
approximately of our medical service revenues are derived from medicare and medicaid reimbursement with rates established by cms  and which rates are subject to legislative changes 
over the last two years  medicare rates have slightly increased  not relating to increased costs of operations 
dialysis is typically reimbursed at higher rates from private payors  such as the patient s insurance carrier  as well as higher payments received under negotiated contracts with hospitals for acute inpatient dialysis services 
our medical service revenues are derived primarily from four sources of medical services revenues for outpatient hemodialysis services home peritoneal dialysis services inpatient hemodialysis services ancillary services  primarily administration of epo see item  business  under the captions general and operations 
the healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulations of federal and state authorities 
there are a variety of fraud and abuse measures to combat waste  which include anti kickback regulations  extensive prohibitions relating to self referrals  violations of which are punishable by criminal or civil penalties  including exclusion from medicare and other governmental programs 
there can be no assurance that there will not be unanticipated changes in healthcare programs or laws or that we will not be required to restructure our practice and will not experience material adverse effects as a result of any such challenges or changes

dialysis corporation of america s future growth depends primarily on the availability of suitable dialysis centers for development or acquisition in appropriate and acceptable areas  and our ability to develop these new potential dialysis centers at costs within our budget while competing with larger companies  some of which are public companies or divisions of public companies with more personnel and financial resources  in acquiring and or developing facilities in areas targeted by us 
additionally  there is intense competition for retaining qualified nephrologists who are responsible for the supervision of the dialysis centers 
there is no assurance as to when any new centers or inpatient service contracts with hospitals will be implemented  or the number of stations  or patient treatments such may involve  or if such will ultimately be profitable 
it has been our experience that newly established dialysis centers  although contributing to increased revenues  have adversely affected our results of operations due to start up costs and expenses and a smaller patient base 
results of operations compared to medical service revenues increased approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects increased revenues of our pennsylvania dialysis centers of approximately  including revenues of  for our new pennsylvania facility which commenced operations in january  decreased revenues of  for our new jersey centers reflecting a reduction in patients at one of our new jersey facilities and termination of our two new jersey acute care contracts  and increased revenues of  for our georgia centers  two of which became operational during which contributed  additional revenues in and another being acquired in april for which revenues amounted to  and a decrease in consulting and license income of approximately  interest and other income decreased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this includes a decrease in interest from our parent of  for the year ended december  compared to the preceding year  consisting of interest on a note receivable and an advance receivable  primarily due to our parent s repayment of the note  a decrease in other interest income of  primarily due to a decrease in average interest rates  an increase in management fee income of  pursuant to a management services agreement with our owned toledo  ohio affiliate and an unaffiliated georgia center with which we entered a management services agreement effective september  a decrease in miscellaneous other income of  and an increase in rental income of  cost of medical services sales as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the preceding year as a result of decreases in both supply costs and payroll costs as a percentage of sales 
we receive approximately of our medical services revenues from the administration of epo to our patients 
this drug is only available from one manufacturer in the united states which raised its price for the product in january  continued price increases for this product without our ability to increase our charges will increase our costs and thereby adversely impact our earnings 
we cannot predict the price increases  if any  or the extent of such by the manufacturer  or our ability to offset any such increases 
selling  general and administrative expenses  those corporate and facility costs not directly related to the care of patients  including  among others  administration  accounting and billing  increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year 
this increase reflects operations of our new dialysis center in pennsylvania  the georgia center acquired in april and a full year s operations for the two georgia centers opened during  and increased support activities resulting from expanded operations 
although selling  general and administrative expenses increased  as a percent of medical service revenues these expenses remained relatively constant amounting to for the year ended december   and for the preceding year 
provision for doubtful accounts increased approximately  largely as a result of increased sales revenues 
the provision remained relatively constant amounting to of sales for the year ended december  and for the preceding year 
the provision for doubtful accounts is determined under a variety of criteria  primarily aging of the receivables and payor mix 
accounts receivable are estimated to be uncollectible based upon various criteria including the age of the receivable  historical collection trends and our understanding of the nature and collectibility of the receivables  and are reserved for in the allowance for doubtful accounts until they are written off 
although operations of additional centers have resulted in additional revenues  some are still in the developmental stage and  accordingly  their operating results will adversely affect results of operations until they achieve a sufficient patient count to sustain profitable operations 
the company experienced same center growth in total treatments of approximately in same center revenues grew in fiscal the company made an acquisition in may of a facility in georgia that added to revenue and to operating income 
overall  operating income grew approximately in fiscal  as our dialysis facilities continue to mature  especially the new dialysis centers added in and during this maturation process  management continues to search for ways to operate more efficiently and reduce costs through process improvements and improve our bottom line 
we are reviewing technological improvements as well  and will make the capital investment if we are confident such improvements will improve patient care and operating performance 
interest expense increased by approximately  for the year ended december   compared to the preceding year primarily as a result of additional equipment financing agreements with the increase tempered to some extent by decreased interest rates 
the prime rate was at december  and at december  accrued compensation of approximately  was bonused to the board of directors on a pro rata basis for exercise of a portion of their options  amounting to  shares at exercise prices ranging from to  representing approximately of the directors aggregate options and approximately of all outstanding options

in december  we paid off the remaining balances on first mortgages with a maryland bank on two of our buildings  one in lemoyne  pennsylvania and the other in easton  maryland  which had a combined balance of approximately  the maryland property has a mortgage to secure a development loan for our vineland  new jersey subsidiary  which loan is guaranteed by the company 
this loan had a remaining principal balance of  at december  and  at december  in april  we obtained a  five year mortgage on our building in valdosta  georgia  which had an outstanding principal balance of approximately  at december  and  at december  see item  properties and note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have an equipment financing agreement for kidney dialysis machines for our facilities  which had an outstanding balance of approximately  at december   and  at december  this included additional equipment financing of approximately  during see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
we opened our eleventh center in mechanicsburg  pennsylvania in january   acquired a center in georgia in april   and opened our th and th centers in cincinnati  ohio and chevy chase  maryland in february  capital is needed primarily for the development of outpatient dialysis centers 
the construction of a station facility  typically the size of our dialysis facilities  costs in the range of  to  depending on location  size and related services to be provided  which includes equipment and initial working capital requirements 
acquisition of an existing dialysis facility is more expensive than construction  although acquisition would provide us with an immediate ongoing operation  which most likely would be generating income 
we presently plan to expand our operations primarily through construction of new centers  rather than acquisition 
development of a dialysis facility to initiate operations takes four to six months and usually up to months or longer to generate income 
we consider some of our centers to be in the developmental stage  since they have not developed a patient base sufficient to generate and sustain earnings 
we are seeking to expand our outpatient dialysis treatment facilities and inpatient dialysis care 
we are in the developmental stage for a new center in indiana and a new center in virginia 
we are presently in different phases of negotiations with physicians for additional outpatient centers 
such expansion requires capital 
no assurance can be given that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy or that financing will be available to support such expansion

critical accounting policies and estimates in december   the sec issued a cautionary advice to elicit more precise disclosure in this item  md a  about accounting policies management believes are most critical in portraying the company s financial results and in requiring management s most difficult subjective or complex judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets and determining the recoverability of our long lived assets 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from the amounts estimated and recorded in our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized as services are rendered 
we receive payments through reimbursement from medicare and medicaid for our outpatient dialysis treatments coupled with patients private payments  individually and through private third party insurers 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from the medicare ersd program  which outpatient reimbursement rates are fixed under a composite rate structure  which includes the dialysis services and certain supplies  drugs and laboratory tests 
certain of these ancillary services are reimbursable outside of the composite rate 
medicaid reimbursement is similar and supplemental to the medicare program 
our acute inpatient dialysis operations are paid under contractual arrangements  usually at higher contractually established rates  as are certain of the private pay insurers for outpatient dialysis 
we have developed a sophisticated information and computerized coding system  but due to the complexity of the payor mix and regulations  we sometimes receive more which we reconcile quarterly 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our patients or their insurance carriers to make required payments 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
changes in general economic  business and market conditions could result in an impairment in the ability of our patients and the insurance companies to make their required payments  which would have an adverse effect on cash flows and our results of operations 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated based on actual collection experience 
we use a combination of percentage of sales and the aging of accounts receivable to establish an allowance for losses on accounts receivable 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the carrying value of deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  we may be required to adjust our valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which could result in additional income tax expense 
long lived assets we state our property and equipment at acquisition cost and compute depreciation for book purposes by the straight line method over estimated useful lives of the assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
these computations are complex and subjective 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this impairment test requires the determination of the fair value of the intangible asset 
if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment changes for these assets 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas effective january  and are required to analyze goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
impact of inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our operations 
a substantial portion of our revenue is subject to reimbursement rates established and regulated by the federal government 
these rates do not automatically adjust for inflation 
any rate adjustments relate to legislation and executive and congressional budget demands  and have little to do with the actual cost of doing business 
see operations medicare reimbursement  government regulation  and risk factors under item  business 
therefore  dialysis services revenues cannot be voluntary increased to keep pace with increases in nursing and other patient care costs 
increased operating costs without a corresponding increase in reimbursement rates may adversely affect our earnings in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we do not consider our exposure to market risks  principally changes in interest rates  to be significant 
sensitivity of results of operations to interest rate risks on our investments is managed by conservatively investing liquid funds in interest bearing accounts of which we held approximately  at december  interest rate risk on debt is managed by negotiation of appropriate rates for equipment financing and other fixed rate obligations based on current market rates 
there is an interest rate risk associated with our variable rate mortgage obligations  which totaled  at december  we have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
assuming a relative decrease in rates on our year end investments in interest bearing accounts and a relative increase in rates on our year end variable rate mortgage debt would result in a negative annual impact of approximately  on our results of operations 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes and do not currently use interest rate derivatives
