brazilian restructuring the brazilian printing and writing uncoated papers market experienced weakness in late and through the first half of  resulting in pressure on the company s operating margins for these products 
beginning in january  the company also reduced its sales of certain grades of these papers that had been negatively impacted by icms  a form of value added business tax 
in addition  in may  the brazilian government enacted an electricity rationing program which had an overall objective of a percent reduction in electricity consumption in brazil and mandated a percent reduction in electricity consumption by the paper industry in the most populated and industrialized regions of brazil 
in response to the brazilian government s electricity reduction directive  the company s brazilian business implemented an electricity reduction program  however  to achieve the required percent reduction  it was necessary to institute production curtailments 
machine downtime was taken to reduce production of the company s least profitable products 
the printing and writing uncoated papers business had been the company s least profitable product line in brazil while also being its largest electricity user 
the duration of the government s electricity reduction directive was uncertain  although it was expected to initially last at least six months through the traditional dry period in brazil 
the brazilian government s forced electricity reduction program was in response to unusually low water levels in the lakes and reservoirs supplying brazil s hydroelectric facilities that provide percent of that country s electricity 
as a result of these business conditions  the company decided during the second quarter of to exit the printing and writing uncoated papers business in brazil  which permitted the company s brazilian operations to comply with the government s electricity rationing program and to better focus on and service its other more profitable product lines 
this plan to restructure its brazilian operations resulted in the company recording a pre tax charge in of million  primarily for the non cash write down of assets related to the printing and writing uncoated papers business and employee termination and severance costs 
non operating expenses the decline in interest expense in compared with was due to a lower average amount of debt outstanding partially offset by a lower amount of interest capitalized to capital projects 
the decline in interest expense in compared with was primarily due to a larger amount of interest capitalized to capital projects as well as lower average interest rates 
the weighted average effective interest rates on the company s long term revolving debt facilities  and term loans for the periods prior to january   were approximately percent in  percent in and percent in other income  net consisted primarily of interest income  royalty income and foreign currency transaction gains and losses in each of the years presented  as well as a favorable settlement related to a prior period claim in income taxes the effective income tax rates for the years ended december   and were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
the effective income tax rate in compared with was impacted by a decrease in the french corporate income tax rate from percent for to percent for and net favorable deferred income tax adjustments of million 
the deferred income tax adjustments were recorded primarily as a result of changes in the company s expectations as to the realization of certain of these tax assets due to the results of recent income tax audits in foreign jurisdictions and changes in the company s estimates of future taxable income in each taxing jurisdiction 
these changes resulted in a net reduction in valuation allowances related to deferred income tax assets 
excluding this net favorable income tax adjustment of million  the effective income tax rate for would have been percent which was lower than due to the reduction in the french corporate income tax rate and due to decreased profitability in the united states which has the company s highest corporate income tax rate and increased profitability in brazil which has the company s lowest corporate income tax rate 
during  the united states internal revenue service irs conducted a review of the company s us federal income tax returns for the years through no adjustments were proposed by the irs auditors as a result of their review 
additionally  french tax authorities are in the process of auditing the company s consolidated french tax group for the years through  including companies formerly part of that tax group prior to the company s spin off from kimberly clark 
the french tax authorities have completed their work at most entities while work at other entities is still to be completed 
as a result of the work conducted to date  the company has received certain assessments and notifications of findings  to which the company has responded to the french tax authorities 
the company believes that any resulting adjustments related to the remaining audit work by the french tax authorities will not be material 
the effective income tax rate in compared with was impacted by a decrease in the french corporate income tax rate from percent for to percent for  which had been enacted in december the lower effective income tax rate in was due to several items  including a million favorable adjustment to reduce spanish deferred income tax valuation allowances  a favorable million tax benefit related to settlement of a prior period claim and million of income tax benefits associated with treatment of certain repatriations during the year 
excluding the effects of these three items  the effective income tax rate for would have been percent 
further affecting the comparison was a decrease in profitability in brazil which has the company s lowest corporate income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  us in millions cash provided by used for operations changes in operating working capital advance payments from customers capital spending changes in debt dividends to swm stockholders purchases of treasury stock the company s primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations  which is principally obtained through operating earnings 
while quarterly fluctuations occur  the company s annual cash flow from operations has been relatively stable historically  reflecting typically consistent demand for its products 
since the company s spin off from kimberly clark in  the company s annual cash flow from operations has exceeded its requirements for capital spending and dividends to stockholders by at least million each year 
the company s cash provided by operations decreased from million in and million in to million in due to million and million obtained in and  respectively  from advance payments from customers for future product purchases 
the company recorded these advance payments as deferred revenue  which is being amortized into net sales as earned and credited to customers based upon a mutually agreed upon amount per unit of product sales 
also impacting cash flow from operations are changes in operating working capital 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed favorably to cash flow by million due primarily to higher accrued expenses and lower accounts receivable  partially offset by higher inventories 
accrued expenses were higher in compared with as a result of increased liabilities at year end associated with employee compensation and benefit costs 
accounts receivable was lower at year end compared with primarily due to lower sales at the end of inventories were higher in due primarily to a significant reduction in customer orders in the latter part of in  changes in operating working capital contributed unfavorably to cash flow by million due primarily to lower accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses were lower in compared with as a result of decreased liabilities at year end associated with capital projects and maintenance costs 
in  changes in operating working capital contributed favorably to cash flow by million due primarily to higher accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by higher accounts receivable 
accounts payable and accrued expenses were higher in compared with as a result of recorded liabilities associated with capital projects and maintenance costs at december  accounts receivable was higher in compared with primarily because of increased french business unit export sales having longer payment terms

outlook except for north america  the markets for the company s products are expected to remain relatively stable during outside north america  trends of improvement are expected to continue in tobacco related paper sales in several key markets 
the restructuring program implemented in brazil in mid is expected to continue to support strong performance in the company s brazilian operations 
incremental cigarette paper capacity is being added by the company in its brazilian operations on existing equipment 
in addition to the new rtl production line being added at the company s spay  france mill for start up in early  the company is also adding incremental cigarette paper production capacity in france on existing equipment to support anticipated market requirements 
cigarette production in the united states continues to decline as a result of declines in domestic cigarette consumption and exports of cigarettes manufactured in the united states 
sales volumes of tobacco related papers of the company s us business segment appeared to have stabilized  with increased market share  until unplanned downtime became necessary late in as a result of reduced customer orders 
reduced orders by most of the company s north american customers reflected weakened demand for cigarettes and a reduction in inventory positions 
recent growth in the discount cigarette segment at the expense of the premium segment makes it unlikely there will be a cigarette price increase in the near term  removing an incentive for retailers to hold higher levels of cigarette inventory 
the unplanned downtime in the us operations extended through the first week of january  although in mid january  us sales returned to more normal levels 
the company did not have significant production or sale of banded or print banded cigarette papers during cigarette manufacturers have not yet finalized their plans for use of these products 
the company continues to work with its customers in their development of papers for reduced ignition propensity cigarettes 
the construction phase of the banded cigarette paper project at the company s spotswood mill has been completed and commercial capacity for producing print banded cigarette paper is being added 
the company currently expects that increased sales of banded and print banded cigarette papers for reduced ignition propensity cigarettes may occur in the latter part of  although there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the timing and volume requirements the company s customers will have for such paper 
selling prices for the company s tobacco related products are expected to be fairly stable during although there has been recent weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and certain other foreign currencies  the us dollar is still strong from an historical perspective  and the current level of wood pulp costs continues to exert some pressure on the company s selling prices  limiting the company s ability to implement price increases since several competitors have cost structures that are based upon those weaker currencies 
the per ton cost of wood pulp appeared to be near the bottom of the pulp price cycle in late and some market pulp producers announced price increases in february cost of products sold for the first half of is expected to be unfavorably impacted by higher per ton wood pulp costs compared with the first half of although the company s purchased energy costs were lower for the full year compared with  such costs increased during the fourth quarter of the company expects its energy costs to be higher in than in additionally  the company expects higher insurance expenses and increased compensation and benefit costs  mainly due to higher medical and pension expenses 
the company expects its consolidated effective income tax rate to be approximately percent for the company currently expects its capital spending to be approximately million for  with approximately million of this total expected to be spent on the rtl expansion project 
during  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of shares of the company s common stock during the period january  through december  in an amount not to exceed million 
through february  the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock under this authorization for million

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates that affect the amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities reported and disclosure of contingencies 
following are four critical accounting matters which are both very important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and required management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements 
the company s management discussed with the audit committee of its board of directors the estimates and judgments made for each of these items and the company s accounting for and presentation of these items in the accompanying financial statements 
the accounting for these matters was based on current facts and circumstances which  in management s judgement  hold potential for change which could affect management s future estimates such that future financial results could differ materially from financial results based on management s current estimates 
pension accounting estimates the company recognizes the estimated compensation cost of employees pension benefits over their approximate period of service to the company in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the company s earnings are impacted by amounts of expense recorded related to pension benefits  which primarily consist of us and french pension benefits 
each year s recorded expense is an estimate based on actuarial calculations of the company s accumulated and projected benefit obligations for its various plans 
these actuarial calculations utilize several key actuarial assumptions which require management judgement  the most significant of which are the discount rate  used to determine the present value of estimated future retirement benefit payments  and the long term rate of return on plan assets  which is the expected average rate of return on plan assets which are expected to pay future benefits 
the company believes that its selections for these key actuarial assumptions are reasonable estimates for its plans and experience 
the company s us employee pension plans accounted for approximately percent of both the company s total pension plan assets and total accumulated benefit obligation as of december  the discount rates used for the company s determination of projected benefit obligations and accumulated benefit obligations for its us employee pension plans were percent and percent at december  and  respectively 
the discount rate fluctuates from year to year based on current market interest rates for high quality fixed income investments 
the company also evaluates the expected average duration of its pension obligations in determining its discount rate 
a change in the discount rate assumption of percent would change the company s estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
the company s assumed annual long term rate of return on plan assets for its us employee pension plan was percent in  was lowered to percent for and will be lowered again to percent for  reflecting lower expected returns on plan assets 
the assumed long term rate of return is determined by evaluating historical and projected returns for benchmark equity and fixed income market indices as well as the projected investment mix of the company s pension assets 
the asset allocation policy of the company s us employee pension plan targets an allocation of percent in equity securities and percent in fixed income securities 
a change in the long term rate of return assumption of percent would change the company s estimated us pension expense by approximately million 
despite the company s belief that its estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results will likely differ from the company s estimates  and these differences could materially affect the company s future financial statements either unfavorably or favorably 
additionally  it is possible that assets of the company s plans could decline as a result of negative investment returns  which combined with increasing amounts of accumulated benefit obligations  could result in the company being required to make significant cash contributions to its plans in future periods 
for additional information regarding pension plan assets  benefit obligations and accounting assumptions  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income tax valuation allowances the company records and maintains income tax valuation allowances as necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount which is estimated more likely than not to be realizable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the company has available net operating loss carryforwards  excess foreign tax credit carryforwards  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and other various tax credits in the jurisdictions in which it operates  for which the company has recorded gross assets totaling million as of december  certain of these potential future benefits are not expected to be utilized in a manner beneficial to the company s financial results prior to their expiration or review by tax courts 
as a result  the company has valuation allowances against certain of the above mentioned assets which totaled million as of december   reducing the related net deferred tax asset to million  an amount which is estimated to be realizable 
while the company believes it is more likely than not that it will be able to realize this amount of estimated net deferred income tax benefits  it is possible that the facts and circumstances on which the company s estimates and judgements are based could change  which could result in additional income tax expense in the future to increase the associated valuation allowances 
however  the company continues to evaluate possible methods to favorably utilize those assets that are reserved and  therefore  it is also possible that changes in the facts and circumstances on which the company s estimates and judgements are based could benefit the company in the future by some of the million of deferred tax assets reserved as of december  for additional information regarding income taxes and valuation allowances  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment valuation paper manufacturing  which is the company s primary manufacturing process  is a mature and capital intensive process 
as a result  the company makes substantial investments in property  plant and equipment which are recorded at cost 
the cost of depreciable property  plant and equipment is depreciated on the straight line method for accounting purposes over the depreciable lives of the assets 
depreciable lives are based on the company s estimates of the useful lives of the assets  that is the period over which the company expects to benefit from the use of the asset 
paper machines and related equipment are not readily obsoleted and are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years 
banded cigarette paper production assets in the united states are generally depreciated over estimated useful lives of years  although that product has not yet been widely commercialized 
the company periodically assesses the likelihood of recovering the cost of long lived assets based on its expectation of future profitability and undiscounted cash flow of the related operations 
these factors  along with management s plans with respect to the operations  are considered in assessing the recoverability of property  plant and equipment 
facts and circumstances upon which management s estimates and plans are based could change  thus the possibility exists of a material adjustment to the company s financial statements in the future 
icms litigation the company evaluates contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  when a material loss contingency exists  the company accrues an estimated loss when the likelihood that the future event or events will confirm the loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if no accrual is made for a material loss contingency because both of the above conditions are not met  or if an exposure to loss exists materially in excess of an accrual that is made  disclosure regarding the contingency is made when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss or additional loss may have been incurred 
as described in detail under litigation in part i  item  legal proceedings  swm b received assessments from the taxing authorities of the state of rio de janeiro  brazil related to icms taxes 
as of december   the assessment totaled approximately million  of which approximately million is covered by an indemnification agreement with the former owner of the predecessor of swm b  for a net exposure to the company of approximately million 
the courts granted swm b relief from having to bond the potential tax liability while it challenges the assessment 
this matter is not currently expected to be resolved for several years 
swm b continues to vigorously contest the assessment and believes the matter will ultimately be resolved in its favor 
the company s current evaluation of the matter is that swm b is more likely than not to prevail in its challenge of the assessment under the facts and law as presently understood 
however  there is a reasonable possibility that swm b will ultimately be required to pay all or a portion of this contingent liability  which could adversely impact the company s future financial results or financial condition 
summary while a material impact to its future financial results or financial condition related to one or more of the above matters is possible  the company does not currently believe it is likely 
the company continually updates and assesses the facts and circumstances regarding these critical accounting matters and other significant accounting matters affecting estimates in its financial statements 
in addition to these accounting matters  other factors may affect the company s results  as described below 
factors that may affect future results many factors outside the control of the company could impact the company s results 
while not an exhaustive list  the following important factors could cause the company s actual results for and beyond to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
international business risks in addition to its us operations  the company has manufacturing facilities in france  brazil and canada 
the company  principally through its french and brazilian subsidiaries  markets and sells products in over countries  many of which are third world markets which are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political and economic conditions  expropriation  import and export tariffs  controls and restrictions  monetary exchange controls  inflationary economies  changes in currency value  changes in business and income tax regulations and risks related to restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
tax and repatriation matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to various business and income tax laws in each of the countries in which it does business through wholly owned subsidiaries and through affiliates 
although the company believes it complies with the many business and income tax requirements of each of its operations  the company is exposed to the possibility of changes in enacted laws and interpretations of laws which could have a material adverse impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
also  the company evaluates its overall financing plans in the various jurisdictions in which it operates and manages international movements of cash from and amongst its foreign subsidiaries in a tax efficient manner  however  an unanticipated international movement of funds due to unexpected changes in the company s business or in needs of the business could result in a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
market risk as a multinational entity  the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices 
the company utilizes a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including operating and financing activities and  where considered appropriate  utilizing derivative instruments 
the company uses derivative instruments only for risk management purposes and not for trading or speculation 
all derivative instruments used by the company are either exchange traded or are entered into with major financial institutions in order to reduce credit risk and risk of nonperformance by third parties 
foreign currency risk the company has subsidiaries located in france  brazil  canada and spain 
the company  together with its subsidiaries  conducts business in over countries worldwide transacting some of its business in foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the company s operating profit 
since the company and its subsidiaries transact business in many other countries  some of those sale and purchase transactions are denominated in a currency other than the local currency of the company s operations 
as a result  changes in exchange rates between the currency in which the transaction is denominated versus the local currency of the company s operations into which the transaction is being recorded can impact the amount of local currency recorded for such transaction 
this can result in more or less local currency revenue or cost related to such transaction  and thus have an effect on the operating profit of the company 
additionally  changes in foreign currency exchange rates may have an impact on the amount reported in other income expense  net 
once the above indicated receivables and payables from the sale and purchase transactions have been recorded  to the extent currency exchange rates change prior to settlement of the balance  a gain or loss on the non local currency denominated asset or liability balance may be experienced  in which case such gain or loss is included in other income expense  net 
the company utilizes forward and swap contracts and  to a lesser extent  option contracts to selectively hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk when it is practical and economical to do so 
the use of these contracts minimizes transactional exposure to exchange rate changes because the gains or losses incurred on the derivative instrument will offset  in whole or in part  the loss or gain on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
these instruments are entered into with well known money center banks  insurance companies or government agencies counterparties 
usually these contracts extend for no more than months 
the company believes that the foreign currency risks that would not be hedged were the counterparties to fail to fulfill their obligations under the contracts are minimal in view of the financial strength of the counterparties 
management of foreign currency transactional exposures was not changed during  and the company does not expect any significant change in such exposures or in the strategies it uses to manage such exposures in the near future 
as of december   a ten percent unfavorable change in the exchange rate of the functional currencies of the company and its subsidiaries against the prevailing market rates of non local currencies involving the company s transactional exposures would have resulted in a net pre tax loss of approximately million 
these hypothetical gains or losses on foreign currency contracts and transactional exposures are defined as the difference between the contract rates and the hypothetical exchange rates 
while the company believes the above loss resulting from the hypothetical unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be material to the company s results of operations  the company reduces this risk by selectively hedging its exposure when it is practical and economical to do so 
interest rate risk the company holds a combination of variable and fixed rate debt consisting of short and long term instruments 
the company selectively hedges its exposure to interest rate increases on its variable rate long term debt when it is practical and economical to do so 
the company utilizes various forms of interest rate hedge agreements  including interest rate swap agreements and forward rate agreements 
most often the company utilizes variable to fixed interest rate swap agreements  typically with contractual terms no longer than months 
the company s strategy to manage exposure to interest rate changes did not change during  and management does not expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate changes or in how such exposure is managed in the near future 
various outstanding interest bearing instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in gains or losses in fair market value of fixed rate debt due to differences between current market interest rates and the rates governing these instruments 
with respect to the company s fixed rate debt outstanding at december   a ten percent change in interest rates would not result in a material change in the fair market value of such debt and with respect to the company s variable rate debt outstanding at december   a ten percent change in interest rates would not result in a material impact to the company s future annual pre tax earnings 
commodity price risk the company is subject to commodity price risk  the most significant of which relates to the price of wood pulp  which is the company s largest single component of cost 
the per ton cost of wood pulp is cyclical in nature and more volatile than general inflation 
the company consumed approximately   and  metric tons of wood pulp in  and  respectively 
during the period from january through december  the us list price of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp  a representative pulp grade used by the company  ranged from a low of per metric ton in march and april of to a high of per metric ton in the latter half of and in january selling prices of the company s paper products are influenced  in part  by the market price for wood pulp  which is determined by worldwide industry supply and demand 
generally  over time  the company has been able to increase its selling prices in response to increased per ton wood pulp costs and has generally reduced its selling prices when wood pulp costs have significantly declined 
increases in prices of wood pulp could adversely impact the company s earnings if selling prices are not increased or if such increases do not fully compensate for or trail the increases in wood pulp prices 
derivative instruments have not been utilized by the company to manage this risk 
with respect to the company s commodity price risk  a hypothetical ten percent change in per ton wood pulp prices would impact the company s future annual pre tax earnings by approximately million  assuming no compensating change in the company s selling prices 
the company believes that  while its exposure to commodity price risk is material to its results of operations  such risk is understood by its customers and over time changes in the price of wood pulp are typically reflected in selling prices 
general inflation due to competitive pressures  the company is not always able to pass along its cost increases through increased selling prices 
the company s main costs impacted by general inflation are wages and salaries  energy  chemicals  employee benefit costs  primarily medical and pension expenses  and costs of insurance 
seasonality sales of the company s products are not subject to seasonal fluctuations  except in the united states and brazil 
in the united states  customer shutdowns typically occur in july and december and typically have resulted in reduced net sales and operating profit during those two months 
additionally  the us mills shut down equipment to perform additional maintenance during these months  resulting in higher product costs and reduced operating profit 
in brazil  customer orders are typically lower in december due to a holiday season through much of january and february 
environmental matters the company is subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to the environmental impact of air  water and other emissions from its mills as well as its disposal of solid waste generated by its operations 
the company believes it is operating in compliance with  or is taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with  such laws and regulations 
while the company has incurred in the past several years  and will continue to incur  capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with these laws and regulations  these costs are not expected to materially affect the company s business or results of operations 
however  there can be no assurance that a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements will not occur at some future time as a result of environmental matters 
additional information concerning environmental matters is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings environmental matters herein 
legal proceedings information concerning legal proceedings is disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and in part i  item legal proceedings herein 
in addition  the company and its subsidiaries are involved in legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and  while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against the company and its subsidiaries  management believes that such actions and claims will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the company s financial statements 
reliance on significant customers most of the company s customers are manufacturers of tobacco products located in more than countries around the world 
two such customers have accounted for a significant portion of the company s net sales in each of the last several years  and the loss of one or both such customers  or a significant reduction in one or both of these customers purchases  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
tobacco products and governmental actions in recent years  governmental entities around the world  particularly in the united states  have taken or have proposed actions that may have the effect of reducing consumption of tobacco products 
reports and speculation with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking and use of tobacco products have been publicized for many years and  together with actions to restrict or prohibit advertising and promotion of cigarettes or other tobacco products  to limit smoking in public places and to increase taxes on such products  are intended to discourage the consumption of cigarettes and other such products 
in the fourth quarter of  the major us cigarette manufacturers reached agreement with all us states and several commonwealths and territories to settle health care cost recovery and other claims 
in anticipation of these settlements and as a direct result of these settlements  most of the us cigarette manufacturers increased prices of cigarettes significantly 
domestic cigarette consumption has declined  in part due to these price increases which  in turn  decreases demand for the company s products 
during  the us department of justice filed a multi billion dollar civil suit against the tobacco industry 
in addition  litigation is pending against the major manufacturers of consumer tobacco products seeking damages for health problems allegedly resulting from the use of tobacco in various forms and for alleged violations of antitrust laws 
it is not possible to predict the outcome of such litigation or what effect adverse developments in pending or future litigation may have on the tobacco industry  its financial liquidity or relationships with its suppliers 
also in recent years  certain governmental entities  particularly in the united states  have considered or proposed actions that would require cigarettes to meet specifications aimed at reducing their likelihood of igniting fires when the cigarettes are not actively being smoked 
the state of new york has enacted a law directing that such a set of requirements be implemented which could take effect beginning as early as the fourth quarter of in december  the state of new york issued a proposed set of requirements for reduced ignition propensity cigarettes  which were subject to a day comment period 
subsequently  the comment period was extended an additional days through april  regulations are scheduled to be implemented days after final requirements are adopted 
cigarette manufacturers are in varying stages of development of cigarettes with such characteristics 
philip morris and the company previously announced the joint development of a banded cigarette paper that may make a cigarette less likely to ignite certain fabrics and have entered into a licensing and royalty agreement covering future commercialization of this new paper 
while the joint development effort with philip morris was undertaken in advance of legislative initiatives in certain states to make cigarettes less likely to ignite certain fabrics when left unattended  the banded cigarette paper product that resulted from the joint development program  marketed under the name paper select by philip morris  is directed toward the same objective as the legislation 
this joint development effort is also discussed in part i  item herein under the caption philip morris supply agreement 
the company also has patents related to alternative means  including print banded cigarette paper  for addressing ignition control and continues to work on other possible innovations with other customers and on its own as the cigarette industry faces these evolving requirements 
the fire safety standards currently proposed by the state of new york include a reference to banded cigarettes performing well in that state s testing 
the actual implementation of these new standards in new york will be dependent upon how quickly the standards are adopted following the comment period 
comments received during the comment period could possibly delay the adoption of these standards 
in december  health canada also indicated that it would evaluate the implementation of new standards that would require cigarette manufacturers to market reduced ignition propensity cigarettes in that country 
proposed fire safety standards were included in a consultation paper that is open for comment 
a potential implementation schedule for the new fire safety standards in canada was not provided in the proposal 
in january  the states of rhode island and massachusetts introduced bills in their respective legislative committees concerning cigarette fire safety standards 
there appears to be momentum building for reduced ignition propensity products  and the company currently anticipates that cigarette manufacturers will use banded and print banded cigarette papers to meet these regulatory requirements  however there is a high degree of uncertainty as to the timing and volume requirements the company s customers will have for such papers 
furthermore  it is not possible to predict what additional legislation or regulations relating to tobacco products will be enacted  or to what extent  if any  such legislation or regulations might affect the consumer tobacco products industry in general 
during  percent of the company s net sales were from products used by the tobacco industry in the making and packaging of cigarettes or other tobacco products 
management is unable to predict the effects that the above described legal and governmental actions might have on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
forward looking statements certain matters discussed in this report  particularly in the foregoing discussion regarding the outlook of the company  critical accounting policies and estimates and factors that may affect future results  constitute forward looking statements  generally identified by  but not limited to  phrases such as the company expects or the company anticipates  as well as by use of words of similar effect  such as appears  could  should  may and typically  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and are subject to the safe harbor created by that act 
this report contains many such forward looking statements  including statements regarding management s expectations of future selling prices for the company s products  the company s anticipated market shares  future market prices for wood pulp used by the company  expected sales volumes trends  new product introductions  anticipated energy  compensation  benefit and insurance costs  anticipated financial and operational results  anticipated capital spending  anticipated tax and other governmental actions  contingencies  anticipated common stock share repurchases and other expected transactions of the company 
forward looking statements are made based upon management s expectations and beliefs concerning future events impacting the company 
there can be no assurances that such events will occur or that the results of the company will be as estimated 
many factors outside the control of the company also could impact the realization of such estimates 
the above mentioned important factors  among others  in some cases have affected  and in the future could affect  the company s actual results and could cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company
