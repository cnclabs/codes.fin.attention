item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the appropriate application of accounting policies  many of which require the company to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from its estimates 
such differences could be material to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required by the policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are periodically reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
historically  the company has found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note a to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies that are described below 
merchandise inventory 
the company s merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of its customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
market development accruals 
the company estimates reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
finite long lived assets 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of finite lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
in making this assessment  management relies on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and marketplace data 
a change in these underlying assumptions may cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying value 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge which would impact earnings 
deferred taxes 
should the company determine that it becomes more likely than not that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
liquidity and capital resources the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended june  of  was the result of funds provided by operating activities totaling  offset by funds used in investing activities of  and by funds used in financing activities totaling  net cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from a decrease in inventory levels totaling  and an increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities of  net earnings provided another  to the increase in operating net cash provided from operations 
cash used in investing activities totaling  was for purchases of property and equipment 
funds used in financing activities were  for the most part  the result of payments of  to the company s bank lender under our credit facility  plus the remaining installment payments  totaling  for the topsville and the i 
appel acquisitions  offset by  of net mortgage loan proceeds 
on december   the company entered into a line of credit agreement with a new bank 
this credit facility  which expires december   provides for short term loans and the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed  based on a borrowing formula  the company may borrow up to  in short term loans and up to  including letters of credit 
substantially all of the company s assets are pledged to the bank as collateral except for the west new york  new jersey facility  which has been separately mortgaged  as noted below 
the line of credit requires that the company maintain a minimum tangible net worth of  through june  and  through june  as of june   borrowing on the short term line of credit was  and the company had  of additional availability based on the borrowing formula under the credit facility 
at june  the company was contingently obligated on open letters of credit for approximately  interest on borrowings under the line of credit is at the bank s prime rate or at libor plus basis points  at the option of the company 
the bank s prime rate at june  was 
on august   the company consummated a mortgage loan with a bank lender in the amount of  the financing is secured by a mortgage of the company s west new york  new jersey headquarters and warehouse facility see the information under the caption item properties 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the financing has a fifteen year term  but is callable by the bank lender at any time after september  and may be prepaid by the company  along with a prepayment fee  from time to time during the term of the financing 
the proceeds of the financing are being used for general working capital purposes 
the company believes that funds provided by operations  existing working capital  and the company s bank line of credit and mortgage financing will be sufficient to meet foreseeable working capital needs 
reference is made to note e  credit facilities  of the notes to consolidated financial statements on page f of this form k for additional information about the company s credit lines 
there were no material commitments for capital expenditures at june  the company previously announced that the board of directors authorized the repurchase by the company of up to  shares of the company s common stock 
purchases may be made from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions  subject to general market and other conditions 
the company intends to finance these repurchases from its own funds from operations and or from its bank credit facility 
as of june   the company purchased  shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately as of june   and  working capital was   and  respectively 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities for those same periods was to  to  and to  respectively 
the increase in the current ratio in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to the use of funds provided by operations and the proceeds from the august mortgage financing to reduce short term borrowing

in addition  higher levels of shipping to existing and new customers of the women s sleepwear business  mostly during the first half of the company s fiscal year  accounted for the remainder of the increase in this category 
net sales for the handbags category in fiscal were  or about lower than the prior fiscal year s total of  the sales decrease mostly reflected the non renewal of the anne klein license and lower sales for the premium bag business  offset somewhat by higher sales in the children s handbag division 
gross margins were in both fiscal and however  the period ended june  includes a  expense related to the portion of purchase costs allocated to inventory for the acquisition of topsville in january  which had the effect of decreasing last year s gross margins by one half of one percent 
gross margins by category were as follows gross margin for the apparel category in increased to in from in the increase was primarily attributable to better full year margins in the children s apparel business  acquired in january gross margin for the handbags category in decreased to in from in this decrease was mainly due to the non renewal of the anne klein licensing business and lower competitive margins in our premium business  offset to some extent by better children s handbag margins 
shipping  selling and administrative expenses increased by  in fiscal including a prior year  charge related to the topsville acquisition mainly due to volume related expenses in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  as a percentage of net sales  shipping  selling and administrative expenses declined to from in fiscal  due to the relatively lower level of fixed expenses in fiscal compared to higher net sales 
interest expense was  an increase of  from the last fiscal year  primarily the result of interest expense associated with the  mortgage financing consummated in august  and also from a greater level of borrowing needed to finance the increased volume of business in the current fiscal year compared to fiscal other income was  for both fiscal and fiscal net earnings of  for the fiscal year ended june  compared to a net loss of  in the prior year including an after tax charge of  relating to the fair value adjustment in connection with the topsville acquisition

interest expense increased to  from  last fiscal year  primarily the result of much higher average borrowing needed to finance the acquisition of topsville  inc and the related increased volume of business in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income decreased by  due to the elimination of securities available for sale which were sold during fiscal in order to utilize such investment funds for current working capital purposes 
other income was lower by  for the fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year

in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee

the recognition provisions of fin will be effective for any guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirement is effective for our fiscal year ended june  we have evaluated the accounting provisions of the interpretations and there was no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended june  the company has not provided any financial guarantees as of june in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation sfas to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we will continue to account for stock based equity compensation using the intrinsic value method of apb opinion we are required to follow the prescribed disclosure format and have provided the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
for the year ended june  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities with the objective of improving financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights  or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
historically  entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements of fin apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we have evaluated the accounting provisions of the interpretations and there was no material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  since the company is not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this statement on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how a company classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the statement will be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the period of adoption 
although we are still in the process of reviewing the new statement  we believe this statement will have no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to interest rate change market risk 
since our borrowing patterns are cyclical  the company is not dependent on borrowing throughout the year 
nevertheless  a sudden increase in interest rates which under our bank line of credit is at the prime rate or at libor plus basis points may  especially during peak borrowing  potentially have a significant negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the company estimates that a basis point fluctuation in applicable market interest rates would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately  based on fiscal borrowing levels 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments 
in addition  we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in us dollar based currencies
