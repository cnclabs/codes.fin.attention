this compared to 
million in adverse development for umbrella losses in policy acquisition costs as a percentage of net premiums earned for the year ended december  were as compared with for the same period of the prior year 
the decrease in the percentage was primarily attributable to the aircraft expense ratio  which reflected a lower ratio as premium surcharges were recorded with a nominal processing charge 
the company expects a higher ratio in since writings in the aircraft line are expected to be significantly less than in the company s combined ratio the loss ratio plus the ratio of policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses divided by premiums earned improved to for the year compared with for excluding losses from the wtc attack  the combined ratio would have been in net investment income for the year ended december  decreased by to million from million for the same period of the decrease reflected lower investment yields as well as larger positions in tax exempt securities in  despite a larger investment asset base in income derived from hedge fund investments approximated million in commission and other income  collectively  decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in the prior year

the cash flows used in operating activities during were made available by investing activities and  in particular  through the sale or maturity of fixed income securities and short term investments 
cash flows are expected to be favorable in the foreseeable future as a result of the strong underwriting climate in the company s lines of business

critical accounting policies the company discloses significant accounting policies in the footnotes of its financial statements 
management considers certain accounting policies to be critical for the understanding of the company s financial statements 
such policies require significant management judgment and the resulting estimates have a material effect on reported results and will vary to the extent that future events affect such estimates and cause them to differ from the estimates provided currently 
these critical accounting policies include unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  allowance for doubtful accounts and impairment of investments 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on individual case estimates for losses reported 
a provision is also included  based on actuarial estimates utilizing historical trends in the frequency and severity of paid and reported claims  for losses incurred but not reported  salvage and subrogation recoveries and for loss adjustment expenses 
unpaid losses with respect to asbestos environmental risks are difficult for management to estimate and require considerable judgment due to the uncertainty regarding the significant issues surrounding such claims 
for a further discussion concerning asbestos environmental reserves see reserves 
management continually reviews and updates the estimates for unpaid losses and any changes resulting therefrom are reflected in operating results currently 
the potential for future adverse or favorable loss development is highly uncertain and subject to a variety of factors including  but not limited to  court decisions  legislative actions and inflation 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on management s review of amounts due from insolvent or financially impaired companies 
allowances are estimated for both premium receivables and reinsurance receivables 
management continually reviews and updates such estimates for any changes in the financial status of companies 
for a further discussion concerning reinsurance receivables see reinsurance ceded 
the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively

million and  respectively  at december  there were no unrealized gains or losses on equity securities at december  effect of recent accounting pronouncements statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas  was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in december sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a company that voluntarily changes its method of accounting for stock based employee compensation to the fair value method 
sfas also requires additional disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and its effect on reported results 
sfas is effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company has adopted the appropriate disclosures under sfas inflation periods of inflation have prompted the pools  and consequently the company  to react quickly to actual or potential imbalances between costs  including claim expenses  and premium rates 
these imbalances have been corrected mainly through improved underwriting controls  responsive management information systems and frequent review of premium rates and loss experience 
inflation also affects the final settlement costs of claims  which may not be paid for several years 
the longer a claim takes to settle  the more significant the impact of inflation on final settlement costs 
the company periodically reviews outstanding claims and adjusts reserves for the pools based on a number of factors  including inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the potential for future losses due to reasonably possible changes in the fair value of financial instruments  which relates mainly to the company s investment portfolio 
those risks associated with the investment portfolio include the effects of exposure to adverse changes in interest rates  credit quality and hedge fund and equity investments 
the largest market risk to the company relates to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk includes the changes in the fair value of fixed maturities based upon changes in interest rates 
this risk is considered when developing benchmarks for evaluating the company s portfolio 
such benchmarks also consider the overall duration of the company s loss reserves 
through the matching of cash flows from future maturing investments with the ultimate payout pattern of loss reserves  the company believes it can minimize the effect of interest rate risk 
the following tabular presentation outlines the expected cash flows of fixed maturities available for sale for each of the next five years and the aggregate cash flows expected for the remaining years thereafter based upon maturity dates 
fixed maturities include taxable and tax exempt securities with applicable weighted average interest rates 
future cash flows of expected principal amounts dollars in millions total total there amortized fair fixed maturities after cost value tax exempts average interest rate taxables average interest rate total credit quality risk includes the risk of default by issuers of debt securities 
the company s investment guidelines are designed and prohibit the investment in securities below bonds rated baa overall  the company maintains fixed maturities with an average credit quality rating of aa as of december  the company s exposure to credit risk is considered minimal 
hedge fund and equity investment risk include the potential loss from the diminution in the value of the underlying investment of the hedge fund and the potential loss from changes in the fair value of equity securities 
the company s hedge fund investments are liquid and the company can generally sell the underlying securities in such hedge funds to hedge fund managers upon days notice 
hedge fund and equity investments are limited by the company s investment guidelines to of policyholders surplus or of total investments  whichever is greater 
the company monitors market risks on a regular basis through meetings with mariner  examining the existing portfolio and reviewing potential changes in investment guidelines  the overall effect of which is to allow management to make informed decisions concerning the impact that market risks have on the portfolio
