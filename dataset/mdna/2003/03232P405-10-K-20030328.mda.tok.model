overview we develop  acquire and operate practice based ambulatory surgery centers in partnership with physician practice groups 
as of december   we owned a majority interest or greater in surgery centers 
the following table presents the changes in the number of surgery centers in operation  under development and under letter of intent for the years ended december   and a center is deemed to be under development when a partnership or limited liability company has been formed with the physician group partner to develop the center 
centers in operation  beginning of the year new center acquisitions placed in operation new development centers placed in operation centers disposed centers in operation  end of the year centers under development  end of the year development centers awaiting con approval  end of year average number of centers in operation  during year centers under letter of intent  end of year we sold our interests in two surgery centers in for their approximate book value 
of the surgery centers in operation as of december   centers perform gastrointestinal endoscopy procedures  centers perform ophthalmology surgery procedures  three centers perform orthopedic procedures and five centers perform procedures in more than one specialty 
the other partner or member in each partnership or limited liability company is generally an entity owned by physicians who perform procedures at the center 
we intend to expand primarily through the development and acquisition of additional practice based ambulatory surgery centers in targeted surgical specialties and through future same center growth 
our growth targets for include the acquisition or development of to additional surgery centers and the achievement of same center revenue growth of to 
while we generally own of the entities that own the surgery centers  and up to in certain instances  our consolidated statements of operations include of the results of operations of the entities  reduced by the minority partners share of the net earnings or loss of the surgery center entities 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued sources of revenues substantially all of our revenue is derived from facility fees charged for surgical procedures performed in our surgery centers 
this fee varies depending on the procedure  but usually includes all charges for operating room usage  special equipment usage  supplies  recovery room usage  nursing staff and medications 
facility fees do not include the charges of the patient s surgeon  anesthesiologist or other attending physicians  which are billed directly by the physicians 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances from third party medical service payors 
practice based ambulatory surgery centers  such as those in which we own a majority interest  depend upon third party reimbursement programs  including governmental and private insurance programs  to pay for services rendered to patients 
the amount of payment a surgery center receives for its services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors  as well as other factors over which we have no control  including medicare and medicaid regulations and the cost containment and utilization decisions of third party payors 
we derived approximately  and of our revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively  from governmental healthcare programs  primarily medicare 
the medicare program currently pays ambulatory surgery centers in accordance with predetermined fee schedules 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
principles of consolidation 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of amsurg and our subsidiaries and the majority owned limited partnerships and limited liability companies in which we are the general partner or majority member 
consolidation of such partnerships and limited liability companies is necessary  as we have or more of the financial interest  are the general partner or majority member with all the duties  rights and responsibilities thereof and are responsible for the day to day management of the partnership or limited liability company 
the limited partner or minority member responsibilities are to supervise the delivery of medical services  with their rights being restricted to those that protect their financial interests  such as approval of the acquisition of significant assets or the incurrence of debt which they  as physician limited partners or members  are required to guarantee on a pro rata basis based upon their respective ownership interests 
intercompany profits  transactions and balances have been eliminated 
we operate in one reportable business segment  the ownership and operation of ambulatory surgery centers 
revenue recognition 
center revenues consist of billing for the use of the centers facilities  or facility fees  directly to the patient or third party payor  and in limited instances  billing for anesthesia services 
such revenues are recognized when the related surgical procedures are performed 
revenues exclude any amounts billed for physicians surgical services  which are billed separately by the physicians to the patient or third party payor 
allowance for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense 
our revenues are recorded net of estimated contractual allowances from third party medical service payors  which we estimate based on historical trends of the surgery centers cash collections and contractual write offs  accounts receivable agings  established fee schedules  relationships with payors and procedure statistics 
in addition  we must estimate allowances for bad debt expense using similar information and analysis 
while we believe that our allowances for contractual adjustments and bad debt expense are adequate  if the actual write offs are in excess of our estimates  our results of operations may be overstated 
at december  and  net accounts receivable reflected allowances for contractual adjustments of million and million  respectively  and allowances for bad debt expense of million and million  respectively 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued goodwill 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require all business combinations to be accounted for by the purchase method 
sfas no 
requires that  upon adoption  amortization of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets will cease and instead  the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets will be evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis  impairment of carrying value will be evaluated more frequently if certain indicators are encountered 
identifiable intangible assets with a determinable useful life will continue to be amortized over that period and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
discussed in recent accounting pronouncements below 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   except for goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june   which were subject immediately to the nonamortization provisions of this statement 
we fully adopted sfas no 
on january   and accordingly  ceased to amortize goodwill  which previously had been amortized over years 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component  with the fair value of the reporting unit being compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered to be impaired 
we have determined that we have one operating as well as one reportable segment 
our centers each qualify as components of that operating segment and have similar economic characteristics  and therefore  should be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit 
we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test and have determined that no potential impairment exists 
as a result  we have recognized no transitional impairment loss in fiscal year in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
purchase price allocation 
we allocate the respective purchase price of our acquisitions in accordance with sfas no 
the allocation of purchase price involves first  determining the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
secondly  the excess amount of purchase price is to be allocated to unidentifiable intangible assets goodwill 
a significant portion of each surgery center s purchase price has historically been allocated to goodwill due to the nature of the businesses acquired  the pricing and structure of our acquisitions and the absence of other factors indicating any significant value which could be attributable to separately identifiable intangible assets 
our resulting goodwill  in accordance with sfas no 
as described above  is no longer amortized  but will be tested for impairment at least annually 
results of operations our revenues are directly related to the number of procedures our surgery centers perform 
our overall growth in procedure volume is directly impacted by the increase in the number of surgery centers in operation and the growth in procedure volume at existing centers 
procedure growth at any existing center may result from additional contracts entered into with third party payors  increased market share of the associated medical practice of our physician partners  new physician partners and or scheduling and operating efficiencies gained at the surgery center 
expenses directly related to such procedures include clinical and administrative salaries and benefits  supply cost and other variable expenses such as linen cost  repair and maintenance of equipment  billing fees and bad debt expense 
the majority of our corporate salary and benefits cost is directly associated with the number of centers we own and manage and tends to grow in proportion to the growth of our centers in operation 
our centers and corporate offices also incur costs which are more fixed in nature  such as lease expense  legal fees  property taxes  utilities and depreciation and amortization 
surgery center profits are allocated to our minority partners in proportion to their individual ownership percentages and reflected in the aggregate as minority interest 
our interest expense results primarily from our borrowings used to fund acquisition and development activity  as well as interest incurred on capital leases 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return and numerous state income tax returns with varying tax rates 
our income tax expense reflects the blending of these rates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the following table shows certain statement of earnings items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and revenues operating expenses salaries and benefits supply cost other operating expenses depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income minority interest interest expense  net of interest income earnings before income taxes income tax expense net earnings year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the following two factors additional surgery centers in operation at year end  primarily resulting from acquisitions  with an average number of centers in operation throughout the year of in compared to in  and same center procedure growth resulting in revenue growth centers included in the same center group 
the additional surgery centers in operation and same center procedure growth resulted in a increase in procedure volume in over in order to appropriately staff our surgery centers for these additional procedures  as well as provide appropriate corporate management for the additional centers in operation  salaries and benefits increased proportionately by to million in from million in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase resulted primarily from additional procedure volume 
other operating expenses increased million to million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the additional surgery centers in operation and additional corporate overhead 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million  or  in from  primarily due to the non amortization of goodwill starting in as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting policies goodwill 
we anticipate further increases in operating expenses in  primarily due to additional start up centers and acquired centers expected to be placed in operation  as well as insurance cost and scheduled property rent increases at our existing centers 
typically  a start up center will incur start up losses while under development and during its initial months of operations and will experience lower revenues and operating margins than an established center until its case load grows to a more optimal operating level  which generally is expected to occur within the 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued months after a center opens 
at december   we had nine centers under development and two centers that had been open for less than one year 
operating income margin increased by  which is primarily the result of the elimination of goodwill as described above  as well as the leverage we achieve from having a high but consistent fixed cost component from year to year at each center 
because each incremental procedure generates only a variable cost component  same center procedure growth generally contributes to operating income at a rate higher than the average operating income margin of the center 
minority interest in earnings in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest increased due to the fact that our minority partners participate in the increased profitability of our centers 
additionally  all of the acquired and developed centers in have a minority ownership  which diluted the impact on minority interest of those existing centers that have less than minority ownership 
interest expense decreased million in  or  from prior to april  our debt level had grown to approximately million  primarily due to acquisition related borrowings 
however  net proceeds from our public offering  as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources  were used to repay a significant portion of our outstanding debt 
additionally  we experienced lower interest rates in than in we recognized income tax expense of million in compared to million in our effective tax rate in and was of net earnings before income taxes and differed from the federal statutory income tax rate of  primarily due to the impact of state income taxes 
because we continue to deduct goodwill amortization for tax purposes  a larger portion of our overall income tax expense is considered deferred income taxes  which result in a continuing increase in our deferred tax liability 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in  primarily due to the following three factors additional surgery centers in operation at year end  primarily resulting from acquisitions  with an average number of centers in operation throughout the year of in compared to in  same center procedure growth resulting in revenue growth centers included in the same center group  and a larger percentage of ophthalmology procedures performed  which have a larger average reimbursement rate per procedure than our average rate experienced in the additional surgery centers in operation and same center procedure growth resulted in a increase in procedure volume in over in order to appropriately staff our surgery centers for these additional procedures  as well as provide appropriate corporate management for the additional centers in operation  salaries and benefits increased proportionately by to million in from million in supply cost was million in  an increase of million  or  over supply cost in this increase resulted primarily from the additional procedure volume and an increased mix of ophthalmology procedures  which require more costly supplies than gastroenterology procedures  our predominant procedure type 
other operating expenses increased million to million  or  in from  primarily as a result of the additional surgery centers in operation and additional corporate overhead 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  in from  primarily due to the additional surgery centers in operation as well as a full year of amortization of additional goodwill from acquisitions completed throughout and the amortization of goodwill acquired from january  to june  in accordance with sfas no 
 we did not amortize goodwill for eight acquisitions completed after june  see critical accounting policies goodwill and note f to the consolidated financial statements 
this change had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements  however 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued operating income margin increased by  which reflects the leverage we achieve from having a high but consistent fixed cost component from year to year at each center

minority interest in earnings in increased million  or  from  primarily as a result of minority partners interest in earnings at surgery centers recently added to operations and from increased same center profitability 
as a percentage of revenues  minority interest increased due to the fact that our minority partners participate in the increased profitability of our centers 
additionally  nearly all of the acquired and developed centers in have a minority ownership  which diluted the impact on minority interest of those existing centers that have less than minority ownership 
interest expense decreased million in  or  from prior to april  our debt level had grown to approximately million  primarily due to acquisition related borrowings

liquidity and capital resources at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  operating activities for generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million in the increase in operating cash flow activity resulted primarily from an additional million in net earnings  resulting primarily from additional centers in operation and growth in same center revenue 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were million and million  respectively 
during  we used approximately million to acquire interests in practice based ambulatory surgery centers  including million for the payment of contingent purchase obligations  primarily as a result of the discontinuance of a proposed rulemaking action by dhhs described below 
in addition  we issued notes payable of million for the acquisition of interests in practice based ambulatory surgery centers  which were paid in january with cash provided from additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we made capital expenditures primarily for new start up surgery centers and for new or replacement property at existing centers totaling approximately million in  which included the purchase of the land and building of a surgery center previously leased 
included in this amount were maintenance capital expenditures of million 
in addition  we entered into capital lease arrangements for replacement equipment of  we used our cash flow from operations to fund our acquisition cash obligations and development activity  and we received approximately million from capital contributions of our minority partners to fund their proportionate share of development activity 
at december   we and our partnerships and limited liability companies had unfunded construction and equipment purchase commitments for centers under development or under renovation of approximately million  which we intend to fund through additional borrowings of long term debt  operating cash flow and capital contributions by minority partners 
during  we were able to make net payments on long term debt of million  including million on our revolving credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  as most recently amended on march   which permits us to borrow up to million to finance our acquisition and development projects at a rate equal to  at our option  the prime rate or libor plus a spread of to  depending upon borrowing levels 
the loan agreement also provides for a fee of of unused commitments 
the loan agreement prohibits the payment of dividends and contains covenants relating to the ratio of debt to net worth  operating performance and minimum net worth 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  borrowings under the credit facility are due in march and are secured primarily by a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries and our membership interests in the limited liability companies 
in  we received approximately million from the exercise of options and issuance of common stock under our employee stock option plans 
tax benefits received from the exercise of those options was million 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in april  we completed a public offering of  shares of class a common stock  including  shares offered by selling shareholders  for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
in july  after receiving shareholder approval  we reclassified our class a and class b common stock into one class of common stock  having the rights of the class a common stock 
the class a and class b shares were reclassified into one class of common stock using a one to one conversion ratio  and  as a result  there was no increase in the total number of shares or book value of common stock outstanding 
in february  we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock over the subsequent months  which we intend to fund through borrowings under our credit facility 
in may  dhhs listed as a discontinued action the june  proposed rule that would update the rate setting methodology  payment rates  payment policies and the list of covered surgical procedures for ambulatory surgery centers 
if implemented  the proposed rule would have reduced the rates paid for certain ambulatory surgery center procedures reimbursed by medicare  including a number of endoscopy and ophthalmology procedures performed at our centers 
although this action has been discontinued  dhhs may propose a new rule at any time that could adversely impact surgery center reimbursement 
upon the announcement of the discontinuance of this proposed rule  we paid the remaining purchase price commitments of approximately million that were contingent on certain outcomes or resolutions of dhhs s proposed rule 
a purchase price obligation of million related to a prior year acquisition remains contingent at december   and is not currently reflected in our financial statements 
we expect to fund such obligation  if such obligation becomes due  with borrowings under our revolving credit facility or from operating cash flow 
in august  the oig published its work plan for the fiscal year 
the work plan identified several projects related to our industry  including a project identified as financial arrangements between physicians and ambulatory surgical centers 
this project will focus on determining if physician ownership in ambulatory surgery centers affects utilization and the cost of outpatient surgeries 
while we believe physician ownership of ambulatory surgery centers as structured within our partnerships and limited liability companies is in compliance with applicable law  there can be no assurance that the outcome of this work plan project would not generate legislative or regulatory changes that would have an adverse impact on us or obligate us to purchase some or all of the minority interests of the physician entities affiliated with us as discussed in business risk factors if regulations or regulatory interpretations change  we may be obligated to buy out interests of physicians who are minority owners of the surgery centers 
the following schedule summarizes all of our contractual obligations by period as of december  in thousands less than total year years years after years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases construction in progress commitments other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations our long term debt may increase based on acquisition activity expected to occur in the future and our stock repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding shares of common stock 
we may use our operating cash flow to repay existing long term debt under our credit facility prior to its maturity date 
other long term obligations consist of purchase price commitments that are contingent upon certain events 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in addition  as of december   we have available under our revolving credit facility million for acquisition borrowings 
our credit facility  as recently amended on march   matures on march  foregoing any significant adverse impact on our future operating results  we believe that our operating cash flow and borrowing capacity will provide us with adequate liquidity for the next five years to conduct our business and further implement our growth strategy

this statement applies to all entities and to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset  except for certain obligations of lessees 
the implementation of sfas no 
will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations

accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business 
this statement also amends accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to eliminate the exception to consolidation for a subsidiary for which control is likely to be temporary 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the provisions are generally to be applied prospectively 
there was no impact on our results of operations from the adoption of this standard 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the standard requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closings  or other exit or disposal activities 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation no  or fin   guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
the interpretation requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the entity must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that obligation 
this interpretation is intended to improve the comparability of financial reporting by requiring identical accounting for guarantees issued with separately identified consideration and guarantees issued without separately identified consideration 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are currently evaluating what impact  if any  adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for us as of december  the required disclosures are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that have certain characteristics 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year beginning after june  to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we have not yet determined the impact  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations

in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december  we have elected not to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
we have included the disclosures in accordance with sfas no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our debt instruments are primarily indexed to the prime rate or libor 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in the table below provides information as of december  and about our long term debt obligations based on maturity dates that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates in thousands  except percentage data fair years ended december  value at december  total fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate fair years ended december  value at december  total fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate the difference in maturities of long term obligations and overall increase in total borrowings principally resulted from our borrowings associated with our acquisition activity and the extension of the maturity date of our revolving credit facility 
the average interest rates on these borrowings at december  decreased as compared to december  due to an overall decrease in market rates and repayment of debt at higher average interest rates
