as of december   we owned a one third investment in eurotel llc eurotel  a domestic corporate joint venture 
eurotel held a investment in pennecom  bv pennecom  an international telecommunications holding company that held a investment in pilicka telefonia  sp

conestoga s wireless business  subsequently sold on january   and conestoga and d e s paging businesses are classified as assets held for sale on the balance sheet 
the paging business has been reported as a discontinued operation 
on january   we entered into a definitive sales agreement to sell conestoga and d e s paging businesses and expect to close the sale during the second quarter of conestoga wireless is included as part of operating activity and not as a discontinued operation because under accounting rules there is deemed to be continuing involvement as a result of our commitment to building out tower sites and a continuing lease guarantee related to certain tower sites

the increased operating loss was primarily attributable to increases in general and administrative expenses and incremental costs associated with network operations and depreciation related to the enhancement of and relocation of certain operations to our new building space in brownstown  pennsylvania  as well as a full year of expenses for our systems integration businesses acquired in the expansion of our clec and internet services operations  which resulted in the addition of  access lines   dial up internet subscribers and  dsl subscribers in  also increased our operating expenses

the conestoga rlecs were experiencing similar trends with higher local telephone service revenue being offset by declining network access revenues 
this shift in revenues was caused by current telecommunications policy of decreasing network access charges and offsetting them by higher local telephone service charges in order to more accurately reflect actual costs 
d e s network access revenues grew in from due to several factors including increased number of access lines and higher call volumes  which resulted in increased minutes of use

the decrease was primarily  of communication services and  of product sales 
we believe these decreases partially relate to the effects of a slowing economy and reductions in customer spending for communications related infrastructure and consulting services 
the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of two businesses during the year  and therefore  reflected a full twelve months of operations for the two new companies 
operating expenses remained flat at  in versus  in  which increased  or from  in the slight decrease versus was a net of increased conestoga expenses and lower d e expenses  both as a result of revenue changes

on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
goodwill and other intangible assets fas 
fas provides guidance on impairment testing for goodwill and intangible assets 
upon the adoption of fas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer subject to amortization 
as of january   the results of the first step indicated no potential impairment of d e s goodwill 
the company completed its annual impairment review and determined that no impairment charge was required 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balances of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  retroactive to january   as required by the sec 
sab provides guidance on recognition of certain non recurring fees and associated incremental direct expenses over the expected term of the customer relationship 
as of january   the total cumulative effect of the adoption  which was recorded as a change in accounting principle  was  net of income taxes of our share of eurotel s cumulative effect of the adoption of sab was effects of inflation it is the opinion of management that the effects of inflation on operating expenses over the past three years have been immaterial and have been partially offset by growth in operating and other revenues 
management anticipates that this trend will continue in financial condition liquidity and capital resources we have historically generated significant cash from our operating activities 
our overall capital resource strategy is to finance capital expenditures for new and existing lines of businesses and acquisitions partly with operating cash and through external sources  such as bank borrowings and offerings of debt or equity securities 
net cash provided by continuing operations was  in cash provided by continuing operations has increased from  in and  in additional cash flow from the conestoga acquisition was the primary reason for the current year increase  and start up and expansion efforts in caused the decrease in cash flows from continuing operations in increased competition in the telecommunications industry could affect future cash flows related to continuing operations 
see business factors affecting our prospects on page net cash used in investing activities was  in and consisted primarily of  for the conestoga business acquisition payments and  of capital expenditures 
the capital additions were primarily digital switching and circuit equipment  computers and software  and poles and cable purchases to upgrade our rlec  clec and internet operating systems  computers and software separate from the telephone network operations primarily for an upgrade to our operating system and software for the billing system and expanded office locations  net cash used in investing activities was  in and consisted primarily of capital expenditures of  and an increase in investments in affiliates to  primarily related to working capital requirements and the repayment of bank borrowings for eurotel  partially offset by net cash of  received on the sale of temporary investments 
our capital expenditures in were concentrated in the following areas digital switching and circuit equipment  computers and software  and poles and cable purchases to upgrade our rlec  clec and internet operating systems  additions related to our new building in brownstown  pennsylvania  and computers and software separate from the telephone network operations primarily for an upgrade to our operating system and software for the billing system and expanded office locations  net cash used in investing activities was  in capital expenditures in were significantly less than in the major capital additions were for digital switching and circuit equipment  computers and software  and poles and cable purchases to continually upgrade the telephone operating system 
the capital additions also included the final of the cost to complete construction of a building addition used by the lancaster county emergency control center and the beginning of construction of a new office building to accommodate employee growth 
during  two businesses were acquired for a combination of stock and cash 
the cash portion of the payments made in was  net cash provided by temporary investments was  in in  net cash of  was provided from affiliates primarily from the distribution of eurotel proceeds on the sale of its hungarian telephone business 
cash provided by financing activities in was  consisting primarily of  in increased long term borrowing that  in addition to helping finance the conestoga acquisition  was used to pay other long term debt of  repay revolving lines of credit of  and to pay  of related debt issuance costs 
payment of dividends used  and of net cash was provided from issuing common stock and repurchasing treasury shares 
financing activities provided cash of  in  consisting primarily of bank borrowings of  under a new credit facility  which were then used to refinance  in long term debt 
in addition  we paid  in in debt issuance costs related to the refinancing 
other financing activities in included the payment of  in common stock dividends and treasury stock purchases of  consisting of in purchases pursuant to our open market purchase program and in a privately negotiated share purchase 
in  net cash used by financing activities was  cash dividends in were  also  payments of long term debt were  uses of cash also included treasury stock purchases of  in the operation and sale of pcs one in provided  of net cash versus usage from pcs one operations of  in and  in external sources of capital at december  during  we abandoned an offering of senior notes due to market conditions 
we completed an amendment to our existing credit facility to increase our long term debt and draw down  from our increased credit facility 
the expanded credit facility consists of a  single draw year senior term loan  a  single draw year senior term loan and a  year senior reducing revolving credit facility 
the  term loan and additional borrowing on the revolving loan was used to complete the conestoga acquisition 
the revolving credit facility  of which  was available as of december   is expected to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes and working capital needs 
on march   we borrowed  to use along with cash from operations to pay  of federal taxes primarily related to the sale of our d e wireless business 
in connection with the amendment and later syndication of the debt  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately  which will be amortized over the year life of the debt 
we amended our credit facility to  among other things  increase certain interest rate provisions  grant the lenders a secured position with respect to all credit facility borrowings and include additional financial covenants 
in connection with the conestoga acquisition  we acquired their long term loan of  the term a loan for  requires interest only payments for three years with increasing quarterly principal payments from the third quarter of through the second quarter the term b loan for  requires interest only payments for two years with increasing quarterly principal payments from the third quarter of through the fourth of quarter the revolving credit facility requires interest only payments for two years with increasing quarterly principal repayments from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of interest on both the loan and the revolving credit facility is payable at a base rate or at libor rates plus an applicable margin based on our leverage ratio 
a commitment fee must be paid on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
the  conestoga loan requires interest only payments for three years with equal quarterly payments from the first quarter of through the fourth quarter of the credit facility includes a number of significant covenants that impose restrictions on our business 
these covenants include  among others  restrictions on expansion of our clec business into new markets  additional indebtedness  mergers  acquisitions and the disposition of assets  sale and leaseback transactions and capital lease payments 
in addition  we are required to comply with financial covenants with respect to the maximum indebtedness to total capitalization ratio and maximum leverage ratio 
upon completion of the sale of our interest in pcs one on april   we received approximately  and subsequently repaid the outstanding balances on our revolving credit facility and our bank lines of credit 
as of may  we discontinued the previous two lines of credit totaling  as of december   we had no other unsecured lines of credit 
the following summarizes our borrowing capacity at december   as limited by our covenants  single draw year term loan  of which  was outstanding   senior reducing revolving credit loan for years  of which  was drawn   single draw year term loan  of which  was outstanding   single draw year term loan  of which  was outstanding 
as of december   the full amount of the revolver was available for borrowing without breaking any of the covenants 
for further information regarding our long term debt  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our ratio of total debt to total debt plus capital decreased to at december  from at december  due primarily to an increase in our debt over the period  which was not as great as the increase in capital caused by the issuance of stock in the conestoga acquisition and net income in largely from the sale of pcs one 
commitments  contingencies and projected uses of capital our most significant commitment for other than for operations  include capital expenditures  the payment of common stock dividends  when and if declared  payment of interest on our outstanding debt and other contractual obligations and commitments which are presented below 
on march   we borrowed  to use along with cash from operations to pay  of federal taxes primarily related to the sale of pcs one 
based on the amended agreement with cobank  we believe that we will have sufficient resources to meet these commitments  contingencies and projected uses of funds 
we hold a interest in eurotel and a interest in pilicka  both of which we account for under the equity method of accounting 
thus  neither the assets nor the liabilities of eurotel or pilicka are presented on a consolidated basis on our balance sheets 
we have also committed to loan eurotel  on an equal basis with the other investors in eurotel  certain of its operating cash needs 
in  we made advances of  pursuant to this commitment and expect that our funding requirements for eurotel will be approximately  we have provided a letter of commitment to advance funds to pilicka for the following table sets forth our obligations and commitments  including debt maturities  to make future payments under contracts  as of december  payments due by period obligation total year years years after years long term debt     capital lease obligations   operating leases   systems integration acquisitions payments total      critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to intangible assets  income taxes  revenues  contingencies and impairment of long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  as further described below 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of all significant accounting policies that we follow in the preparation of our financial statements 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies as those that are the most significant to our financial statement presentation and that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition revenues for all of our business segments are generally recorded when services are provided or products are delivered 
our rlec and clec pricing is subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in adjustments in future periods to revenues derived from our rlec and clec operations 
we monitor these proceedings closely and make adjustments to revenue accordingly 
we receive a portion of our interstate access revenues in our rlec segments from settlement pools in which we participate with other telephone companies through the national exchange carrier association  inc neca 
these pools were established at the direction of the fcc and are funded by interstate access service revenues  which the fcc regulates 
revenues earned through this pooling process are initially recognized based on estimates and are subject to adjustments that may either increase or decrease the amount of interstate access revenues 
if the actual amounts that we receive from the settlement pools differ from the amounts that we have recorded as accounts receivables on our balance sheets  we would be required to record the amount of such a reduction or increase as an adjustment to our earnings 
historically  we have not experienced significant adjustments to our revenues as a result of our participation in these pools 
regulated asset depreciation we use a composite group remaining life method and straight line composite rates to depreciate the regulated property assets of our rlec and clec segments 
under this method  when we replace or retire such assets  we deduct the net book value of these assets and charge it to accumulated depreciation 
the effect of this accounting is to amortize any gains or losses on dispositions over the service lives of the remaining regulated telephone property assets rather than recognizing such gain or loss in the period of retirement 
in addition  use of the composite group remaining life method requires that we periodically revise our depreciation rates 
such revisions are based on asset retirement activity  cost of removal and salvage values and often require that we make related estimates and assumptions 
if actual outcomes differ from our estimates and assumptions  we may be required to adjust depreciation and amortization expense  which could impact our earnings 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  including our property  plant and equipment and our finite lived intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed based on future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
any impairment loss  if indicated  would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for long lived assets  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles upon the adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are no longer subject to amortization 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by comparing carrying value to fair value 
there is a two step process for goodwill 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of reporting units to their carrying value 
if the results of the first step of the impairment testing indicate a potential impairment  the second step would be completed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balances of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the sum of the expected future cash flows derived from such goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
such evaluations for impairment are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses  the market price of our stock and other factors 
while we have never recorded a material impairment charge for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles  future events or changes in circumstances could result in a material charge to earnings 
investment in unconsolidated affiliates we have investments and advances to affiliated entities that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we periodically evaluate whether there have been declines in value in these investments  and if so  whether these declines are considered temporary or other than temporary 
other than temporary declines would be recognized as realized losses in earnings 
evidence of a loss in value includes  but is not limited to  our inability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
the fair value of an investment that is less than its book value may indicate a loss in value of the investment 
our evaluations are based on many factors  including the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than carrying amount  the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow factors  and our intent and ability to hold the investment  including strategic factors 
retirement benefits retirement benefits are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled in the future 
retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by a company 
we record the costs of providing retirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
our estimates include assumptions regarding the discount rate to value the future obligation and the expected return on our plan assets 
we use discount rates in line with current market interest rates on high quality fixed rate debt securities 
our return on assets is based on our current expectation of the long term returns on assets held by the plan 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations  funding requirements and periodic benefit costs that we incur 
income taxes we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
we have two categories of income taxes current and deferred 
current taxes are those amounts we expect to pay when we file our tax returns 
since we must report some of our revenues and expenses differently for our financial statements than we do for income tax purposes  we record the tax effects of those differences as deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates that are currently in effect 
management judgment is required in determining the provision for current income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset that we may not be able to use in the preparation and filing of our future tax returns 
we have recorded a valuation allowance due to uncertainties related to the ability to utilize some of the deferred tax assets  consisting primarily of equity income losses carried forward before they expire

in january  the emerging issues task force issued eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf primarily addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  it addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying eitf  separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the provisions of eitf are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  d e is currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on its financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and changes in our leverage ratio which may increase the margin added to the interest rate as provided in our loan agreement 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows fixed interest rates secured term loans  subject to interest rate fluctuations senior secured revolving credit facility  senior secured term loans  as part of our loan covenant conditions  we have arranged interest rate protection on one half of the total amount of senior indebtedness outstanding  with a weighted average life of at least years 
as of december   our bank debt is as follows average principal rate fair value rates fixed for two years through interest rate swaps   rates fixed for three years through interest rate swaps   rates fixed for four years through interest rate swaps   fixed rate debt  rates fixed for twelve years   total fixed rates of total debt   variable rate debt of total debt   if interest rates rise above the rates fixed by these swaps  we could realize other income of  for each basis points above the fixed rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize other expense of approximately  for each basis point decrease in rates 
the interest rate swaps were arranged to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations 
the swaps were arranged with three banks that participate in our senior indebtedness 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and to receive in turn an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged 
net interest positions are settled quarterly 
average notional average received terms of swaps amounts pay rate rate fair value to to to if interest rates rise above the rates fixed by these swaps  we could realize other income of  for each basis points above the fixed rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize other expense of approximately  for each basis point decrease in rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  it is not considered to be material
