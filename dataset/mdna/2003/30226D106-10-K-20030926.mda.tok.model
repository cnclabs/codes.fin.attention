value added resellers 
we have entered into agreements to sell our products through more than resellers in approximately countries 
our value added resellers include regional networking system resellers  resellers who focus on specific vertical markets  network integrators and wholesale distributors 
we provide training and support to our resellers and our resellers generally provide the first level of support to end users of our products 
our relationships with resellers are generally on a non exclusive basis 
our resellers are not given privileges to return inventory and do not automatically participate in any cooperative marketing programs 
we generally recognize product revenue from our end user and reseller customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations or contingencies remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations or contingencies are satisfied 
see revenue recognition in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
field sales 
we have trained our field sales organization to support and develop leads for our resellers and to establish and maintain a limited number of key accounts and strategic customers 
to support these objectives  our field sales force assists end user customers in finding solutions to complex network system and architecture problems  differentiates the features and capabilities of our products from competitive offerings  continually monitors and understands the evolving networking needs of enterprise and service provider customers  promotes our products and ensures direct contact with current and potential customers  and monitors the changing requirements of our customers 
as of june   our worldwide sales and marketing organization consisted of individuals  including directors  managers  sales representatives  and technical and administrative support personnel 
we have domestic sales offices located in states and international sales offices located in countries 
international sales international sales are an important portion of our business 
in fiscal  sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for of our consolidated net revenue  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal these sales are conducted primarily through foreign based distributors and resellers managed by our worldwide sales organization  in addition to direct sales to end user customers  including large global accounts 
the primary markets for sales outside of the united states include the countries in western europe and japan 
although not a significant component of total revenues to date  we have also achieved sales growth in the people s republic of china and other countries throughout the asia pacific region 
marketing we have a number of marketing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products and to inform existing and potential customers and our distributors and resellers about the features and performance of our products 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry tradeshows  technical conferences and technology seminars  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  a publicly available website  web based training courses  advertising and public relations 
in addition  we are developing e commerce processes and systems for our resellers  distributors and end user customers 
we also submit our products for independent product testing and evaluation 
backlog our products are often sold on the basis of standard purchase orders that are cancelable prior to shipment without significant penalties 
in addition  purchase orders are subject to changes in quantities of products and delivery schedules in order to reflect changes in customer requirements and manufacturing capacity 
our business is characterized by seasonal variability in demand and short lead time orders and delivery schedules 
actual shipments depend on the then current capacity of our contract manufacturers and the availability of materials and components from our vendors 
we believe that only a small portion of our order backlog is non cancelable and that the dollar amount associated with the non cancelable portion is immaterial 
accordingly  we do not believe that backlog at any given time is a meaningful indicator of future revenue 
customer support and service we offer modular and comprehensive extremeworks service solutions to help protect our customers network investments and support their business goals 
the markets we address  including enterprises and service providers  all seek higher reliability and maximum uptime 
our goal is to serve as a knowledgeable and experienced service partner who can tailor service solutions to meet the specific business needs of our customers 
accordingly  in fiscal year we entered into a global services agreement with international business machines  inc for the provision of on site hardware support to customers

we also maintain a relationship with solectron corporation for the handling of product returns and repairs covered by our warranty and service contracts in various locations worldwide 
warranty expenses related to this relationship are recorded in product cost of revenue on our consolidated statement of operations 
support contract expenses related to this relationship are recorded in services cost of revenue on our consolidated statement of operations

the classes cover a wide range of topics such as installation  configuration  operation  management and optimization providing customers with the necessary knowledge and experience to successfully deploy and manage our products in various networking environments 
classes are scheduled and available at numerous locations worldwide 
manufacturing we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations as part of our strategy to maintain global manufacturing capabilities and to reduce costs 
we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and test development at our main campus in santa clara  california 
this approach enables us to reduce fixed costs and to flexibly respond to changes in market demand 
we have strategic partnerships with two contract manufacturers flextronics international  ltd 
for the manufacture of our products in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico and plexus corp 
for the manufacture of our products in nampa  idaho and penang  malaysia 
each of these vendor s manufacturing processes and procedures are iso certified 
our commitments with our contract manufacturers are currently on a purchase order basis 
we are currently negotiating a contract with flextronics that will enhance and formalize our arrangement with them 
we design and develop the key components of our products  including asics and printed circuit boards 
we determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of such components 
our contract manufacturers utilize automated testing equipment to perform product testing and burn in with specified tests 
together with our contract manufacturers  we rely upon comprehensive inspection testing and statistical process controls to assure the quality and reliability of our products 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements that will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
although we use standard parts and components for our products where it is appropriate  we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources 
our principal single source components include asics  merchant silicon  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memory  dynamic and static random access memories  or drams and srams respectively  and printed circuit boards 
purchase commitments with our single or limited source suppliers are generally on a purchase order basis 
see purchase commitments in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
a number of vendors supply standard product integrated circuits and microprocessors for our products 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components  or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
qualifying additional suppliers can be time consuming and expensive and may increase the likelihood of errors 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
we order many of our materials and components on an indirect basis through our contract manufacturers 
research and development the success of our products to date is due in large part to our focus on research and development 
we believe that continued success in the marketplace will depend on our ability to develop new and enhanced products employing leading edge technology 
accordingly  we are undertaking development efforts with an emphasis on increasing the reliability  performance and features of our family of products  and designing innovative products to reduce the overall network operating costs of customers 
our product development activities focus on solving the needs of enterprises  service providers and metropolitan area network markets 
current activities include the continuing development of a next generation chipset aimed at extending the capabilities of our products 
our ongoing research activities cover a broad range of areas  including  in particular  gigabit ethernet and sonet  metropolitan network and internet routing software  asic design  network management software  broadband access equipment  wireless networking equipment and content networking devices 
our products have been designed with a uniform system architecture for all products  that expedites our design and development cycle as well as the time to market for new products and features 
we have utilized this design approach to develop and introduce new products and enhancements and we intend to continue with this simplified approach to architectural design to develop and introduce additional products and enhancements in the future 
as of june   our research and development organization consisted of individuals 
our expenditures for research and development in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts do not include in process research and development charges in the amount of million related to our acquisitions in fiscal competition the market for switches is part of the broader market for networking equipment  which is dominated by a few large companies  particularly cisco systems 
each of these companies has introduced  or has announced its intention to develop  switches that are or may be competitive with our products  such as the catalyst family of switches offered by cisco systems 
in addition  there are a number of large telecommunications equipment providers  including alcatel and nortel networks  which have entered the market for network equipment  particularly through acquisitions of public and privately held companies 
we expect to face increased competition  particularly price competition  from these and other telecommunications equipment providers 
we also compete with other public and private companies that offer switching solutions  including enterasys networks  foundry networks  inc  huawei technologies  riverstone networks  com corporation and dell computer corporation 
these vendors offer products with functionality similar to our products or provide alternative network solutions 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to develop and offer competitive products 
furthermore  we compete with numerous companies that offer routers and other technologies and devices that traditionally have managed the flow of traffic on the enterprise or metropolitan area networks 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  as well as greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base  than we do 
as a result  these competitors are able to devote greater resources to the development  promotion  sale and support of their products 
in addition  competitors with a large installed customer base may have a significant competitive advantage over us 
we have encountered  and expect to continue to encounter  many potential customers who are confident in and committed to the product offerings of our principal competitors  including cisco systems 
accordingly  these potential customers may not consider or evaluate our products 
when such potential customers have considered or evaluated our products  we have in the past lost  and expect in the future to lose  sales to some of these customers as large competitors have offered significant price discounts to secure these sales 
we believe the principal competitive factors in the network switching market are expertise and familiarity with network protocols  network switching and network management  product performance  features  functionality and reliability  price performance characteristics  timeliness of new product introductions  adoption of emerging industry standards  customer service and support  size and scope of distribution network  brand name  access to customers  and size of installed customer base 
we believe that we compete favorably with our competitors with respect to each of the foregoing factors 
however  because many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  they may have larger distribution channels  stronger brand names  access to more customers and a larger installed customer base than we do 
such competitors may  among other things  be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to distribution partners than we can 
to remain competitive  we believe that we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products and enhancing our current products and maintain customer satisfaction worldwide 
if we fail to do so  our products will not compete favorably with those of our competitors and that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
based on our commitment to build a patent portfolio  we have in process a number of patent applications relating to our proprietary technology 
we have filed patent applications in selected countries abroad as deemed appropriate 
there can be no assurance that these applications will be approved  that any issued patents will protect our intellectual property  or that third parties will not challenge these patents or applications 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar or competing technology or design around any patents that we may obtain 
with respect to trademarks  we have fourteen registered trademarks in the united states 
in addition  we have a significant number of pending trademark applications and registered trademarks abroad 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to  and distribution of  our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we provide our software products to end user customers primarily under shrink wrap license agreements included within the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus these agreements may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
there can be no assurance that these precautions will prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the networking industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  leading companies in the data communications and networking markets have extensive patent portfolios with respect to networking technology 
from time to time  third parties  including these leading companies  have asserted and may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property rights against us in regard to technologies and related standards that we consider to be important 
we expect to increasingly be subject to infringement claims asserted by third parties as the numbers of products and competitors in the market for network switches grow and product functionality overlaps 
as detailed below under legal proceedings  we are currently engaged in litigation with lucent technologies  inc lucent 
lucent is asserting claims that allege infringement of certain patent rights  against which we are defending vigorously  but we cannot assure you that we will prevail in this litigation 
in addition to the litigation with lucent  we have been in communication with a number of major technology companies that assert certain of our products require a license under a number of their patents 
these parties have indicated a willingness to grant us a royalty bearing  non exclusive license under the identified patents  as well as other patents that we may require 
we are currently reviewing the identified patents to determine whether we consider a license necessary 
however  there can be no assurance that these licenses would be obtainable on commercially acceptable terms 
in the future  we may determine it is necessary to initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights 
any such claims  whether asserted by us or a third party against us  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty bearing license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in the event a third party is successful in a claim of infringement  our failure or inability to develop non infringing technology or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis may have a material  adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
employees as of june   we employed people  including in sales and marketing  in engineering  in operations  in customer support and service  and in finance and administration 
we have never had a work stoppage and no personnel are represented under collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
we believe that our future success depends on our continued ability to attract  integrate  retain  train and motivate highly qualified personnel  and upon the continued service of our senior management and key personnel 
none of our personnel is bound by an employment agreement 
the market for qualified personnel is competitive  particularly in the san francisco bay area  where our headquarters is located 
at times  we have experienced difficulties in attracting new personnel

item properties our principal administrative  sales  marketing and research and development facilities are located in santa clara  california 
we also lease office space and executive suites in various other geographic locations domestically and internationally for sales and service personnel and engineering operations 
our aggregate lease expense for fiscal was approximately million  net of sublease income of approximately million 
we believe our current facilities will adequately meet our growth needs for the foreseeable future  and we are actively engaged in efforts to sublease excess space we acquired in prior years to meet the anticipated growth at that time 
item legal proceedings on may   lucent filed suit against extreme networks and foundry networks  inc foundry in the united states district court for the district of delaware  civil action no 
the complaint alleges willful infringement of us patent nos 
    and  and seeks a judgment a determining that we have willfully infringed each of the five patents  b determining that foundry has willfully infringed four of the five patents  c permanently enjoining us from infringement  inducement of infringement and contributory infringement of each of the five patents  d permanently enjoining foundry from infringement  inducement of infringement and contributory infringement of four of the five patents  and e awarding lucent unspecified amounts of trebled damages  together with expenses  costs and attorneys fees 
we answered lucent s complaint on july   denying that we have infringed any of the five patents and also asserting various affirmative defenses and counterclaims that seek judgment a that lucent s complaint be dismissed and lucent be denied all requested relief  b declaring that we do not infringe  induce infringement or contribute to the infringement of any valid and enforceable claim of the five patents  c that each of the five patents be declared invalid  d finding the case exceptional within the definition of usc  and e that lucent pay our attorneys fees and costs 
discovery is proceeding 
as set forth above  we have denied lucent s allegations and intend to defend the action vigorously 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will prevail in this litigation  which could have a material  adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
beginning on july   purported securities fraud class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the cases were consolidated and the litigation is now captioned as in re extreme networks  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
no 
sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas sdny the operative amended complaint is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased extreme networks common stock from april  through december  it names as defendants extreme networks  six of our present and former officers and or directors  including our ceo the extreme networks defendants  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering and october secondary offering 
subsequently  plaintiffs and one of the individual defendants stipulated to a dismissal of that defendant without prejudice 
the complaint alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the registration statement for the offerings did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the offerings in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the securities act allegations against the extreme networks defendants are made as to the secondary offering only 
the amended complaint also alleges that false analyst reports were issued 
no specific damages are claimed 
similar allegations were made in other lawsuits challenging over other initial public offerings and follow on offerings conducted in and the cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the court denied the motions to dismiss the claims in our case under the securities act of the court denied the motion to dismiss the claim under section a of the securities exchange act of against extreme networks and other issuer defendants  on the basis that the complaints alleged that the respective issuers had acquired companies or conducted follow on offerings after their initial public offerings 
the court denied the motion to dismiss the claims under section a and a of the securities exchange act of against the remaining extreme networks defendants and other individual defendants  on the basis that the respective amended complaints alleged that the individuals sold stock 
we have decided to accept a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants 
in this settlement  plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the extreme network defendants  in exchange for a contingent payment by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all of the ipo cases  and for the assignment or surrender of control of certain claims we may have against the underwriters 
the extreme networks defendants will not be required to make any cash payments in the settlement  unless the pro rata amount paid by the insurers in the settlement exceeds the amount of the insurance coverage  a circumstance which we do not believe will occur 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured  after class members are given the opportunity to object to the settlement or opt out of the settlement 
if the settlement is not approved  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the lawsuit 
failure to prevail could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
other than the proceedings stated above  we are not aware of any pending legal proceedings against us that  individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we may in the future be party to litigation arising in the course of our business  including claims that we allegedly infringe third party trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
such claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the critical accounting policies stated below  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from sales of our stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from service fees relating to the maintenance and installation of  and training on  our products 
our revenue recognition policy follows sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we generally recognize product revenue from our end user and reseller customers at the time of shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price of the product is fixed or determinable and collection of the sales proceeds is reasonably assured 
when significant obligations or contingencies remain after products are delivered  such as installation or customer acceptance  revenue and related costs are deferred until such obligations or contingencies are satisfied 
revenue from service obligations under maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual period  which typically range from one to five years 
when we provide a combination of products and services to customers  revenue is allocated based on the relative fair values 
we make certain sales to partners in two tier distribution channels 
the first tier consists of a limited number of independent distributors that sell primarily to resellers and  on occasion  to end user customers 
under specified conditions  we grant these distributors the right to return a portion of unsold inventory to us for the purpose of stock rotation 
therefore  we defer recognition of revenue on all sales to these distributors until the distributors sell the product  as evidenced by a monthly sales out report that the distributors provide to us 
our decision to defer revenue on these sales until the distributors sell the product required judgment 
others  in similar circumstances  may conclude it is appropriate to recognize revenue on such sales upon delivery to the distributor 
the second tier of the distribution channel consists of a large number of third party resellers that sell directly to end users and are not granted return privileges  except for defective products 
we provide an allowance for sales returns based on our historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and our return policies 
the allowance is charged to net revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
if the historical data used by us to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future levels of product returns  these estimates would have to be modified  thus resulting in an impact to net revenue 
inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product lifecycle and product development plans and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
in fiscal and fiscal  demand for our products was adversely affected by the downturn in the global economy and reduced telecommunications and infrastructure capital spending  particularly in the united states 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments would significantly impact the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
in the future  if we find that our estimates are too optimistic and we determine that our inventory needs to be written down  we will be required to recognize such costs in our cost of revenue at the time of such determination 
conversely  if we find our estimates are too pessimistic and we subsequently sell product that has previously been written down  our operating margin in that period will be unusually favorable 
warranty reserves networking products can contain undetected hardware or software errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are released to the marketplace 
we have experienced such errors in connection with products and product upgrades 
our standard hardware warranty period is months from the date of shipment to end users and months from the date of shipment to channel partners  which include resellers and distributors 
upon shipment of products to our customers  including both end users and channel partners  we estimate expenses for the cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty and accrue a liability for this amount 
the determination of our warranty requirements is based on our actual historical experience with the product or product family  estimates of repair and replacement costs and any product warranty problems that are identified after shipment 
we estimate and adjust these accruals at each balance sheet date in accordance with changes in these factors 
while we believe that our warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgments applied in calculating this accrual are appropriate  the assumptions used are based on estimates and these estimated amounts could differ materially from our actual warranty expenses in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for bad debts in general and administrative expense when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends in the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring most of our customers in the asia pacific region  excluding japan  to pay cash in advance or secure letters of credit when placing an order with us 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we make an assessment of the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be likely  a valuation allowance is established 
during fiscal  we established a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was calculated in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires an assessment of both negative and positive evidence when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
in accordance with sfas  evidence  such as operating results during the most recent three year period  is given more weight than our expectations of future profitability  which are inherently uncertain 
our net losses in recent periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets under sfas this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
purchase commitments we currently have arrangements with two contract manufacturers and other suppliers for the manufacture of our products 
our arrangements allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast provided by us 
we are obligated to the purchase of long lead time component inventory that our contract manufacturers procure in accordance with the forecast  unless we give notice of order cancellation outside of applicable component lead times 
as of june   we were committed to purchase approximately million of such inventory during the first quarter of fiscal if actual demand of our products is below these projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments of long lead time components with our contract manufacturers 
as a consequence  we may then need to record a charge to cost of revenue to reflect the impact of such excess purchase commitments 
goodwill and other long lived assets we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess whether goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives and other long lived assets must be tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the carrying value of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these long lived assets may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to the expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes in extreme networks market capitalization relative to net book value 
any changes in key assumptions about the business or prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals  if any  are based only on the most current and dependable information available at any given time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reassess the potential liability from pending claims and litigation and the probability of claims being successfully asserted against us 
as a result  we may revise our estimates related to these pending claims and litigation 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows in the future 
for further detail  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of legal proceedings 
results of operations net revenue net revenue was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue  service revenue was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in revenue in japan 
the decrease in net revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decline in revenue in the united states  as our business was negatively impacted by the cautious purchasing behavior of customers in the difficult economic environment during fiscal  offset in part by an increase in revenue from service provider customers in japan 
sales outside of the united states accounted for  and of net revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in net revenue outside the united states in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a reduction of sales in japan 
the decrease in united states sales in fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of total sales was primarily attributable to reduced sales within the united states in the first half of as a result of the events of september  sales within the united states in the second half of fiscal steadily increased as a percentage of total sales 
we expect that export sales will continue to represent a significant portion of net revenue  although export sales may decline as a percentage of net revenue 
all sales transactions are currently denominated in united states dollars 
during fiscal and fiscal  the united states economy experienced a prolonged downturn for information technology products generally 
we believe this phenomenon has adversely affected demand for our products and has made it increasingly more difficult to accurately forecast future production requirements 
our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal could be adversely impacted by the continuing weakness and uncertainty in the economies of the united states and other industrialized countries 
while we expect this economic downturn to continue for some time  we cannot predict the extent  severity or length of this economic downturn in the united states or in the other geographic regions where we currently sell our products 
further  we expect that our revenue during fiscal will be significantly affected by the timing and success of the introduction of new products during the fiscal year 
we are experiencing some erosion of average selling prices of our products due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and rapid technological change 
our revenue is derived primarily from sales of our summit  blackdiamond and alpine product families and fees for services relating to the installation and maintenance of  and training on  our products 
the level of sales to any customer may vary from period to period  however  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
one customer  who is a distributor of our products  accounted for  and of our net revenue in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue includes costs of raw materials  direct labor  manufacturing overhead and amounts paid to third party contract manufacturers  service operations and other costs related to warranty and contractual obligations 
gross margin was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal these decreases were primarily due to the related decreases in revenue 
as a percentage of net revenue  gross margin was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal year the increase in gross margin percent in fiscal over fiscal resulted primarily from a shift in product mix and a decrease in the net charges related to contract manufacturers and other costs associated with the carrying value of inventory  including a benefit to cost of revenue in fiscal of million relating to products sold that were written off in fiscal this increase in gross margin in fiscal over fiscal was adversely affected by a significant increase in warranty expense 
during fiscal we experienced a higher than normal rate of warranty expense due to problems with various component parts within our products and our election  in some cases  to address those problems by replacing such products with new rather than refurbished replacements 
we intend to reduce these expenses in the future  however our gross margin will continue to be adversely affected until we have completed the implementation of operational changes designed to reduce these expenses 
as a result of our increased service revenue as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal  we have separately reported product and service gross margin 
the fiscal service gross margin calculation includes all service related expenses 
gross margin for fiscal and fiscal is presented in total since we do not have records that detail product and service cost of revenue in separate categories 
furthermore  in the past  some service related expenses were included in operating expenses as part of the line item entitled sales  marketing and service expense 
for fiscal and going forward  our new erp system that was implemented at the beginning of fiscal enables us to record cost of product and service revenue in separate detail 
we were able to identify the service expenses that had previously been included in operating expenses and  therefore  our fiscal and fiscal results reflect the reclassification of million and million  respectively  from operating expenses to cost of services revenue 
such amounts represented and of previously reported operating expenses for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our service line of business had a negative gross margin in fiscal due primarily to a number of programs that we implemented to improve service delivery productivity and enhance customer satisfaction 
we have developed and implemented plans to improve our service gross margin going forward 
these plans include increasing service revenue and reducing service infrastructure expenses and service outsourcing expenses 
while we expect our service line of business to generate positive gross margin as a result of these plans we cannot predict the success or timing of the impact of these plans 
inventory purchases and commitments are based upon our forecast of future sales 
to mitigate the component supply constraints that existed in fiscal  we built inventory levels for certain components with long lead times and entered into long term commitments with our suppliers for certain components 
due to a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products that became apparent in the third quarter of fiscal  inventory levels  including non cancelable purchase commitments  exceeded our requirements based on our forecast of expected demand 
we recorded a provision for excess and obsolete inventory  including non cancelable purchase commitments of million  totaling million in the third quarter of fiscal the million excess inventory charge was calculated based on the inventory levels in excess of our forecast of expected demand for each product 
based on our then determined future demand forecast  we did not  and we currently do not  anticipate that the excess inventory subject to these provisions will be used at a later date 
furthermore  we may be required to take additional write downs in the future related to excess inventory 
our product and service gross margins are variable and dependent on many factors  some of which are outside of our control 
some of the primary factors affecting gross margin include demand for our products  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  and the mix of products sold 
our gross margin may be adversely affected by increases in material or labor costs  increases in warranty expense or the cost of providing services under extended service contracts  heightened price competition  obsolescence charges and higher inventory balances 
in addition  our gross margin may fluctuate due to the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold  including the effects of our two tier distribution model 
any significant decline in sales to our resellers  distributors or end user customers  or the loss of any of our key resellers  distributors or end user customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  an increase in distribution channels generally makes it more difficult to forecast the mix of products sold and the timing of orders from our customers 
new product introductions may result in excess or obsolete inventories  which may also reduce our gross margin 
furthermore  if we are not able to reduce product and warranty costs in future quarters and improve the gross margin of our service line of business  gross margin would continue to be adversely affected 
cost of product revenue for fiscal and total cost of revenue in all periods includes the cost of our manufacturing overhead 
we outsource the majority of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations  and we conduct quality assurance  manufacturing engineering  document control and repairs at our facility in santa clara  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue consists of payments to our contract manufacturers flextronics international  ltd 
located in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico and plexus corp 
located in nampa  idaho and penang  malaysia 
as part of our business relationship with mcms  inc mcms  the predecessor in interest to plexus corp  in september  we entered into a million operating equipment lease for manufacturing equipment with a third party financing company  we  in turn  subleased the equipment to mcms 
due to the liquidity problems at mcms and its voluntary bankruptcy filing for protection under chapter on september   we recorded a charge of million related to the equipment lease in the first quarter of fiscal on january   mcms completed an agreement to sell a majority of its assets to plexus corp 
for million 
we expect to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturers as a result of volume efficiencies if and as production volumes increase 
however  we do not know if or when such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain these price reductions could have a material adverse effect upon our gross margin and operating results 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal the decreases in fiscal and fiscal were primarily due to lower aggregate sales commissions and a reduction of people in fiscal and people in fiscal in our sales and marketing organization 
as a percentage of net revenue  sales and marketing expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we recently announced and implemented a reduction in force and other cost control measures which are intended to reduce our expenses  including sales and marketing expenses  in absolute dollars in the next few quarters 
the rate of future spending increases in our sales and marketing expenses  if any  will depend on the pace of recovery in the market for networking products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
research and development expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was a result of tightening our focus on our core product lines 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to higher payroll and related personnel expenses associated with the addition of new personnel  partly through acquisitions  to support our multiple product development efforts as well as non recurring engineering charges and prototype costs 
as a percentage of total net revenue  research and development expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in these percentages in fiscal and fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue in fiscal and fiscal we expense all research and development expenses as incurred 
while we recently implemented a reduction in force and other measures to reduce expenses  including research and development expenses  in the next few quarters  we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect research and development expense to remain in the to range as a percentage of net revenue 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to decreases in bad debt expense of million and rent expense of million offset by increases in professional fees of million and salaries and benefits of million 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due primarily to increased professional fees and directors and officers insurance premiums 
as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in these percentages in fiscal and fiscal was primarily the result of decreases in our net revenue in fiscal and fiscal in june  we implemented a reduction in force and other expense control measures to reduce expenses  including general and administrative expenses  in the next few quarters 
the rate of any future spending increases in our general and administrative expenses  if any  will depend on the pace of recovery in the market for networking products 
increased legal expenses related to intellectual property litigation may also cause general and administrative expenses to increase 
impairment of acquired intangible assets during fiscal  we performed our annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
this evaluation indicated decreased expected future demand for the products associated with the goodwill and  therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we evaluated goodwill and purchased intangible assets associated with recent acquisitions for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the assessment was performed as a result of weakening economic conditions and decreased current and expected future demand for certain categories of products in the markets in which we operate 
as a result of the assessment  we recorded a charge to reduce goodwill and purchased intangible assets of million 
amortization of deferred stock compensation amortization of deferred stock compensation was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal amortization of deferred stock compensation is attributable to unvested stock options subject to forfeiture issued to employees that we assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions of optranet and webstacks 
deferred stock compensation is amortized as charges to operations  using the graded method  over the vesting periods of the individual stock options  generally four years 
upon termination of an employee  the amount of expense recognized under the graded vesting method that is in excess of the amount actually earned is reversed 
for the year ended june   we reversed million of excess compensation expense related to terminated employees 
amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets we adopted sfas as of july  sfas requires goodwill and certain other intangible assets to be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous accounting standards required 
accordingly  as of july   we stopped amortizing goodwill with a carrying value of million 
this amount was subsequently written off due to impairment in fiscal purchased in process research and development we recorded in process research and development charges of million related to the purchase of optranet in january and million related to the purchase of webstacks in march the value assigned to purchased in process research and development was determined through valuation techniques generally used by appraisers in the high technology industry and was immediately expensed in the period of acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative use had been identified 
restructuring charges during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of million 
the restructuring charges included excess facilities charges of million  severance charges of million and asset impairments of million 
the excess facilities charge represents an increase to the charge recognized during the third quarter of fiscal the commercial real estate market has continued to deteriorate since the initial charge was taken in the third quarter of fiscal necessitating an increase in reserves that take into consideration the unfavorable difference between lease obligation payments and projected sublease receipts 
as a result of the excess facilities charges recorded in fiscal and fiscal  rent expense in fiscal is expected to decrease by approximately million from fiscal levels 
severance charges of million related to a reduction in total staff during the second quarter of fiscal of approximately people  or of the total workforce  across all departments 
severance charges of million related to a reduction in total staff announced at the end of the fiscal year of approximately people  or of the total workforce  across all departments 
compensation expense in fiscal is expected to decrease by approximately million as a result of these reductions 
the asset impairment charge relates to the write off of leasehold improvements and office furniture related to excess facilities 
depreciation expense in fiscal is expected to decrease by approximately million as a result of these facilities related write offs 
during fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan to lower our overall cost structure 
restructuring charges of million included a million charge related to the exit of two facility leases we entered into in june  excess facilities charges of million and a write off of fixed assets of million 
the excess facilities charges were the result of our decision to permanently reduce occupancy or vacate certain domestic and international facilities 
the asset impairment charge represented the unamortized amount of the assets at the date a decision was made to discontinue use 
these assets were not utilized subsequently or held for sale 
they were either scrapped or abandoned 
in march  we implemented a restructuring plan in order to lower our overall cost structure 
in connection with the restructuring  we reduced our headcount and consolidated facilities 
restructuring charges included in other operating expenses were million in the quarter ended march  and million in the quarter ended june  the restructuring expense included million for severance and benefits for approximately terminated employees  million for the write off and write down in carrying value of summit equipment and million in facility closure expenses 
property and equipment write off during fiscal  we completed a property and equipment physical inventory in conjunction with the implementation of our new erp system 
the property and equipment physical inventory resulted in the identification of million of property and equipment whose fair value was determined to be zero because the assets were either no longer in service or were not identifiable 
therefore these assets were written off during the second quarter of fiscal interest income interest income was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal and a decrease of million in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower interest rates 
the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was due to lower interest rates  offset by an increase in our available investment balances due to the net proceeds we received from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes in december interest expense interest expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal from fiscal in december  we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes maturing in interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to a full year of interest expense on these notes 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to interest expense on the notes from the date of their issuance through the end of fiscal other expense other expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal other expense in fiscal was primarily comprised of amortization of costs associated with the convertible subordinated notes of million and a write down of investments in privately held companies of million partially offset by translation gains of million 
the increase in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to write downs of investments in privately held companies that are being accounted for under the cost method 
provision benefit for income taxes the provision for income taxes of million for fiscal is primarily attributable to a million non cash charge to income tax expense recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
we recorded this charge in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which places greater weight on previous cumulative losses than the outlook for future profitability when determining whether deferred tax assets can be realized 
based upon our most recent three year history of losses and relying on other guidance specified in sfas  we determined that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance will be evaluated periodically and can be reversed partially or totally if business results have sufficiently improved to support realization of our deferred tax assets 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for fiscal the benefit for fiscal results in an effective tax benefit rate of  which consists primarily of federal and state income tax benefits offset by nondeductible goodwill 
we recorded a tax benefit of million for fiscal  which consisted primarily of federal and state income tax benefits  offset by foreign taxes  nondeductible in process research and development and goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable securities were million and million at june  and june   respectively  representing an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to cash provided by operating activities of million and proceeds from issuance of common stock of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million 
we generated million in cash from operations in fiscal despite a net loss of million 
the net loss included significant non cash charges including the deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  a restructuring charge of million  a property and equipment write off of million and depreciation of million 
accounts receivable decreased to million at june  from million at june  days sales outstanding in receivables decreased to days at june  from days at june  the decrease in accounts receivable and days sales outstanding were primarily due to shipment linearity and improved collections performance 
inventory levels decreased to million at june  from million at june  inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times and avoid stock outs with the risk of inventory excess or obsolescence because of recent declining demand  rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
as a result of the rapid change in the market for networking products  we recorded million and million in charges for excess and obsolete inventory and non cancelable purchase commitments in fiscal and  respectively 
deferred revenue increased to million at june  from million at june  this increase was due primarily to increased service obligations under maintenance contracts 
we have a revolving line of credit for million with silicon valley bank 
as of june   there were no outstanding borrowings under this facility 
the line of credit contains a provision for the issuance of letters of credit not to exceed the unused balance of the line 
at june   we had letters of credit totaling million 
these letters of credit were primarily issued to satisfy requirements of certain of our customers for performance bonds 
the line of credit requires us to maintain specified financial covenants related to tangible net worth and liquidity 
as of june   we were not in compliance with the tangible net worth covenant and obtained the necessary waiver and expect to be in compliance in future quarters 
the line of credit expires on november  it is our intention to renew this line of credit when it expires 
as part of our business relationship with mcms  inc  the predecessor in interest to plexus corp  we entered into a million operating equipment lease for manufacturing equipment in september with a third party financing company  we  in turn  subleased the equipment to mcms 
the equipment lease with the third party financing company requires us to make monthly payments through september and to maintain specified financial covenants related to profitability and our cash to debt ratio with which we were in compliance as of june  the liability related to this lease is included in lease commitments on the balance sheet 
in december  we completed a private placement of million of convertible subordinated notes 
the notes mature on december  interest is payable semi annually at per annum 
the notes are convertible at the option of the holders into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment 
the notes are redeemable in cash at our option at an initial redemption price of of the principal amount on or after december if not converted to common stock prior to the redemption date 
each holder of the notes has the right to cause us to repurchase all of such holder s convertible notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest upon a change of control of ownership of extreme networks  as defined in the offering circular 
instead of paying the repurchase price in cash  we may  if we satisfy certain conditions  elect to pay the repurchase price in common stock valued at of the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the five trading days immediately preceding and including the third trading day prior to the repurchase date 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations including interest payments at june   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations convertible subordinated notes non cancelable operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures or non cancelable purchase commitments as of june  we require substantial capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories and accounts receivable and for capital expenditures 
as a result  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital at any time 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
if we are unable to obtain such additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable securities and cash available from credit facilities and future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months

eitf discusses that software deliverables are within the scope of sop as are non software deliverable s for which the related software is essential to the functionality of the non software deliverable s

risk factors we are not profitable and we cannot assure you that we will be profitable in the future fiscal was the only year in which we have achieved profitability 
we reported losses for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal we anticipate continuing to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will continue to need to rationalize expense levels and increase revenue levels to achieve profitability in future fiscal quarters 
a number of factors could cause our quarterly financial results to be worse than expected  resulting in a decline in our stock price our failure to control our operating expenses at a level that is consistent with anticipated revenue may cause our financial results to be worse than expected 
a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  so any delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to fall below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our stock to fall 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
orders at the beginning of each quarter do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time 
accordingly  we are dependent upon obtaining orders during a quarter and shipping those orders in the same quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  the timing of product releases and purchase orders  in addition to product availability  often results in a majority of our product shipments being scheduled near the end of a quarter 
failure to ship these products by the end of a quarter may adversely affect our operating results 
our customer agreements generally allow customers to delay scheduled delivery dates or to cancel orders within specified timeframes without significant charges to the customers 
furthermore  some of our customers require that we provide installation or inspection services that may delay the recognition of revenue for both products and services  and some of our customer agreements include acceptance provisions that prevent our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have varied significantly in the past and may vary significantly in the future due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the following changes in general and or specific economic conditions in the networking industry  seasonal fluctuations in demand for our products and services  particularly in asia pacific and europe  linearity of quarterly sales have historically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of such sales occur in the last month of the quarter  reduced visibility into the implementation cycles for our products and our customers spending plans  our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products  which in the case of lower than expected sales  may result in excess or obsolete inventory in addition to non cancelable purchase commitments for component parts  product returns or the cancellation or rescheduling of orders  our ability to develop  introduce  ship and support new products and product enhancements and manage product transitions  announcements and new product introductions by our competitors  our ability to develop and support relationships with enterprise customers  service providers and other potential large customers  our ability to achieve targeted cost reductions  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products on a timely basis  increases in the prices of the components that we purchase  decreases in the prices of the products that we sell  our ability to achieve and maintain desired production volumes and quality levels for our products  the mix of products sold and the mix of distribution channels through which products are sold  downward adjustments resulting from other than temporary declines in the carrying value of long lived assets  costs associated with adjustments to the size of our operations  costs relating to possible acquisitions and the integration of technologies or businesses  and the effect of amortization of deferred compensation and purchased intangibles resulting from existing or new transactions 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
intense competition in the market for networking equipment could prevent us from increasing revenue and returning to profitability the market for networking equipment is intensely competitive 
our principal competitors include cisco systems  enterasys networks  foundry networks  inc  nortel networks and riverstone networks 
in addition  a number of private companies have announced plans for new products  or have introduced products  that may compete with our own products 
some of our current and potential competitors have superior market leverage  longer operating histories and substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources  in addition to wider name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
these competitors may have developed  or may in the future develop  new competing products based on technologies that compete with our own products or render our products obsolete 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic partnerships that enable them to offer or bring to market competitive products 
consolidation within our industry could lead to increased competition and could harm our operating results 
the pricing policies of our competitors impact the overall demand for our products and services 
some of our competitors are capable of operating at significant losses for extended periods of time  increasing pricing pressure on our products and services 
if we do not maintain competitive pricing  the demand for our products and services  as well as our market share  may decline 
from time to time  in responding to competitive pressures  we lower the prices of our products and services 
when this happens  if we are unable to reduce our component costs or improve operating efficiencies  our revenues and margins are adversely affected 
to remain competitive  we believe that we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products  improve our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
such investment will increase our expenses and affect our profitability 
in addition  if we fail to make this investment  we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and future profitability 
when our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we incur significant unexpected expenses and could lose sales network products frequently contain undetected software or hardware errors when new products or new versions or updates of existing products are first released to the marketplace 
in the past  we have experienced such errors in connection with new products and product upgrades 
we have experienced component problems that caused us to incur higher than expected warranty and service costs and expenses and to take an accrual for anticipated expenses 
such expenses adversely affected our results for fiscal and fiscal we have undertaken extensive efforts to address these issues  however until these programs are completed  these expenses are expected to exceed normal levels 
in the future  we expect that  from time to time  such errors or component failures will be found in new or existing products after the commencement of commercial shipments including the components we incorporate in our products 
these problems may have a material adverse effect on our business by causing us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  diverting the attention of our engineering personnel from new product development efforts  delaying the recognition of revenue and causing significant customer relations problems 
further  if products are not accepted by customers due to such defects  and such returns exceed the amount we accrued for defect returns based on our historical experience  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our products must successfully interoperate with products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur in a network  it may be difficult to identify the sources of these problems 
the occurrence of hardware and software errors  whether or not caused by our products  could result in the delay or loss of market acceptance of our products and any necessary revisions may cause us to incur significant expenses 
the occurrence of any such problems would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend upon international sales for a significant portion of our revenue and our ability to grow our international sales depends on successfully expanding our international operations international sales constitute a significant portion of our net revenue 
our ability to grow will depend in part on the continued expansion of international sales 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net revenue  respectively  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our international sales primarily depend on the success of our resellers and distributors 
the failure of our resellers and distributors to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including longer accounts receivable collection cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  the payment of operating expenses in local currencies  which exposes us to risks of currency fluctuations  difficulty in safeguarding intellectual property  political and economic turbulence  potential adverse tax consequences  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including compliance with us and foreign export laws and regulations 
in addition  conducting our business on a global basis subjects us to a number of frequently changing and complex trade protection measures and import or export regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with these measures and regulatory requirements may result in the imposition of financial penalties and restrictions on our ability to conduct business in and with certain countries  which may harm our business and damage our reputation 
pursuant to regulations of the us department of commerce providing for voluntary disclosure  we have disclosed information regarding a possible violation of certain export regulations 
following such disclosures the department of commerce will determine whether to conduct an investigation 
if an investigation is commenced  we believe that these matters will be resolved without a material adverse effect on our business  and we have implemented procedures to reduce the risk of violations in the future 
our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  increases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency which will expose us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
if we do so  we may decide to engage in hedging transactions to minimize the risk of such fluctuations 
we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to offset the impact of payment of operating expenses in local currencies to some of our operating foreign subsidiaries 
however  if we are not successful in managing these hedging transactions  we could incur losses from hedging activities 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decrease  which may reduce gross margin or revenue the network equipment industry has traditionally experienced a rapid erosion of average selling prices due to a number of factors  including competitive pricing pressures  promotional pricing and technological progress 
in addition  companies have lowered their prices in order to liquidate excess inventory that has accumulated as a result of the current economic slowdown 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to competitive pricing pressures  excess inventories  increased sales discounts and new product introductions by us or our competitors  including  for example  competitive products manufactured with low cost merchant silicon 
we may experience substantial decreases in future operating results due to the erosion of our average selling prices 
competitive pressures are expected to increase as a result of the industry slowdown that began in the first half of  coupled with the recent downturn in the broader economy 
to maintain our gross margin  we must develop and introduce on a timely basis new products and product enhancements and continually reduce our product costs 
our failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
some of our customers may not have the resources to pay for our products as a result of the current economic environment with the current economic slowdown  some of our customers are forecasting that their revenue for the foreseeable future will generally be lower than originally anticipated 
some of these customers are experiencing  or are likely to experience  serious cash flow problems and  as a result  may find it increasingly difficult to obtain financing  if financing is available at all 
if some of these customers are not successful in generating sufficient revenue or securing alternate financing arrangements  they may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  the amounts that they owe us 
in particular  sales to the service provider market are especially volatile and continued declines or delays in sale orders from this market may harm our financial condition 
furthermore  they may not order as many products from us as originally forecast  or cancel orders with us entirely 
the inability of some of our potential customers to pay us for our products may adversely affect our cash flow  the timing of our revenue recognition and the amount of revenue  which may cause our stock price to decline 
the market in which we compete is subject to rapid technological progress and to compete we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance the network equipment market is characterized by rapid technological progress  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
if we do not regularly introduce new products in this dynamic environment  our product lines will become obsolete 
developments in routers and routing software could also significantly reduce demand for our products 
alternative technologies could achieve widespread market acceptance and displace the ethernet technology on which we have based our product architecture 
we cannot assure you that our technological approach will achieve broad market acceptance or that other technologies or devices will not supplant our own products and technology 
when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
the market for switching products is evolving and we believe our ability to compete successfully in this market is dependent upon the continued compatibility and interoperability of our products with products and architectures offered by other vendors 
in particular  the networking industry has been characterized by the successive introduction of new technologies or standards that have dramatically reduced the price and increased the performance of switching equipment 
to remain competitive  we need to introduce products in a timely manner that incorporate  or are compatible with  these emerging technologies 
we are particularly dependent upon the successful introduction of new products in calendar year we cannot assure you that any new products we introduce will be commercially successful 
we have experienced delays in releasing new products and product enhancements in the past that resulted in lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
we may experience similar delays in product development and releases in the future  and any delay in product introduction could adversely affect our ability to compete  causing our operating results to be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
our limited ability to protect our intellectual property and defend against claims may adversely affect our ability to compete we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  we cannot assure you that the actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights or that other parties will not independently develop similar or competing products that do not infringe on our patents 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners  and control access to and distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise misappropriate or use our products or technology 
our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
we are actively involved in disputes and licensing discussions with others regarding their claimed proprietary rights and cannot assure you that we will always successfully defend ourselves against such claims 
if we are found to infringe the proprietary rights of others  or if we otherwise settle such claims  we could be compelled to pay damages or royalties and either obtain a license to those intellectual property rights or alter our products so that they no longer infringe upon such proprietary rights 
any license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
litigation resulting from claims that we are infringing the proprietary rights of others could result in substantial costs and a diversion of resources  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are engaged in litigation regarding intellectual property rights  and an adverse outcome could harm our business and require us to incur significant costs we have received notice from several major companies alleging that we are infringing their patents 
one of these companies  lucent technologies  inc  filed a claim against us alleging patent infringement and we are in litigation as of the date of this filing 
following examination of this claim  we believe it is without merit and we have responded accordingly 
without regard to the merits of this or any other claim  if judgments by a court of law on this or any other claim received in the future were to be upheld  or if we otherwise agree to the settlement of such claims  the consequences to us may be severe and could require us to  among other actions stop selling our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a royalty bearing license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms or available at all  pay damages  or redesign those products that use the disputed technology 
if we are compelled to take any of the foregoing actions  our business could be severely harmed 
adjustments to the size of our operations may require us to incur unanticipated costs prior to the quarter ended april   we experienced rapid growth and expansion that placed  and may in the future place  a significant strain on our resources 
subsequent to that period  we have from time to time incurred unanticipated costs to downsize our operations to a level consistent with downward forecasts in sales 
even if we manage the current period of instability effectively  as well as possible expansion in the future  we may make mistakes in restructuring or operating our business such as inaccurate sales forecasting or incorrect material planning 
any of these mistakes may lead to unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to size our operations in accordance with growth or decline of our business in the future 
delays in the implementation of new management information systems may cause a significant burden on our operations we have implemented additional management information systems and are developing further operating  administrative  financial and accounting systems and controls to improve and maintain close coordination among our executive  engineering  accounting  finance  marketing  sales and operations organizations 
in addition  we recently completed the transition to a new enterprise resource planning system 
we may be unable to operate our control systems in an efficient manner  and our current or planned personnel systems  procedures  and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
the difficulties associated with designing and implementing these new systems  procedures  and controls may place a significant burden on our management and our internal resources 
in addition  as we grow internationally  we will need to expand our worldwide operations and enhance our communications infrastructure 
any delay in the implementation of such new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  or any disruption in the transition to such new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could adversely affect our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain  and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
we must continue to develop and increase the productivity of our indirect distribution channels to increase net revenue and improve our operating results our distribution strategy focuses primarily on developing and increasing the productivity of our indirect distribution channels through resellers and distributors 
if we fail to develop and cultivate relationships with significant resellers  or if these resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
many of our resellers also sell products from other vendors that compete with our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into additional reseller and or distribution agreements or that we will be able to successfully manage our product sales channels 
our failure to do any of these could limit our ability to grow or sustain revenue 
in addition  our operating results will likely fluctuate significantly depending on the timing and amount of orders from our resellers 
we cannot assure you that our resellers and or distributors will continue to market or sell our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
most of our revenue is derived from sales of three product families  so we are dependent on widespread market acceptance of these products during fiscal  we derived substantially all of our revenue from sales of our summit  blackdiamond and alpine products and related services 
we expect that revenue from these product families will account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  widespread market acceptance of our product families is vital to our future success 
factors that may affect the sales of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include the demand for switching products gigabit ethernet and layer switching technologies in particular in the enterprise and service provider markets  the performance  price and total cost of ownership of our products  the availability and price of competing products and technologies  our ability to match supply with demand for certain products  and the success and development of our resellers  distributors and field sales channels 
we may not be able to achieve widespread market acceptance of our product families  which could reduce our revenue 
future performance will depend on the introduction and acceptance of new products our future performance will also depend on the successful development  introduction  and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address customer requirements in a timely and cost effective manner 
in particular  we are dependent upon the successful introduction of new products in calendar year in the past  we have experienced delays in product development and such delays may occur in the future 
we have recently announced a third generation chipset for use in future products 
the introduction of new and enhanced products may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for existing products 
therefore  to the extent customers defer or cancel orders in the expectation of new product releases  any delay in the development or introduction of new products could cause our operating results to suffer 
the inability to achieve and maintain widespread levels of market acceptance for our current and future products may significantly impair our revenue growth 
if a key reseller  distributor  or other significant customer cancels or delays a large purchase  our net revenue may decline and the price of our stock may fall to date  a limited number of resellers  distributors and other customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue 
if any of our large customers stop or delay purchases  our revenue and profitability would be adversely affected 
for example  one distributor of extreme networks products accounted for  and of extreme networks net revenue for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our expense levels are based on our expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term  so a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to a significant reseller  distributor or other customer could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
although our largest customers may differ from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent on large orders from a relatively small number of customers  particularly in view of the relatively high per unit sales price of our products and long sales cycles 
while our financial performance depends on large orders from a limited number of key resellers  distributors and other significant customers  we do not have binding purchase commitments from any of them 
for example our service providers and enterprise customers can stop purchasing  and our resellers and distributors can stop marketing  our products at any time  our reseller agreements are non exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation upon the resellers to renew the agreements  and our reseller  distributor and end user customer agreements generally do not require minimum purchases 
under specified conditions  some third party distributors are allowed to return products to us 
we do not recognize revenue on sales to distributors until the distributors sell the product to their customers 
the sales cycle for our products is long and we may incur substantial non recoverable expenses or devote significant resources to sales that do not occur when anticipated the use of indirect sales channels may contribute to the length and variability of our sales cycle 
our products have a relatively high per unit sales price  and the purchase of our products often constitutes a significant strategic decision by a customer regarding its communications infrastructure 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on the results of a variety of internal procedures associated with the evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
accordingly  the product evaluation process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three months to longer than a year  and as a result  our ability to sell products is subject to a number of significant risks  including the risk that budgetary constraints and internal acceptance reviews by customers will result in the loss of potential sales  the risk of substantial variation in the length of the sales cycle from customer to customer  making decisions on the expenditure of resources difficult to assess  the risk that we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management time in an attempt to initiate or increase the sale of products to customers  but not succeed  the risk that  if a sales forecast from a specific customer for a particular quarter is not achieved in that quarter  we may be unable to compensate for the shortfall  which could harm our operating results  and the risk that downward pricing pressures could occur during this lengthy sales cycle 
we purchase several key components for products from single or limited sources and could lose sales if these suppliers fail to meet our needs we currently purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources and are dependent upon supply from these sources to meet our needs 
certain components such as tantalum capacitors  static random access memory  or sram  and printed circuit boards have been  and may be in the future  in short supply 
we have in the past  and are likely in the future  to encounter shortages and delays in obtaining these or other components  and this could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer orders 
our principal sole source components include asics  merchant silicon  microprocessors  programmable integrated circuits  selected other integrated circuits  custom power supplies  and custom tooled sheet metal 
our principal limited source components include flash memories  dynamic and static random access memories  or drams and srams  respectively  and printed circuit boards 
we use our forecast of expected demand to determine our material requirements 
lead times for materials and components we order vary significantly  and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
if forecasts exceed orders  we may have excess and or obsolete inventory on hand or under non cancelable purchase commitments that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
if orders exceed forecasts  we may have inadequate inventory of certain materials and components  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
we do not have agreements fixing long term prices or minimum volume requirements from these suppliers 
from time to time we have experienced shortages and allocations of certain components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
qualifying new suppliers to compensate for such shortages may be time consuming and costly  and may increase the likelihood of errors in design or production 
in addition  during the development of our products  we have experienced delays in the prototyping of our chipsets  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
we cannot assure you that similar delays will not occur in the future 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that the performance of the components as incorporated in our products will meet the quality requirements of our customers 
our dependence on contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing requirements could harm our operating results if the demand for our products grows  we will need to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity  and internal test and quality functions 
any disruptions in product flow could limit our revenue  adversely affect our competitive position and reputation  and result in additional costs or cancellation of orders under agreements with our customers 
we rely on independent contractors to manufacture our products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of these manufacturers 
we currently utilize two companies for the manufacture of our products flextronics international  ltd  located in san jose  california and guadalajara  mexico and plexus corp  located in nampa  idaho and penang  malaysia 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from contract manufacturers in the past  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
similar or other problems may arise in the future  such as products of inferior quality  insufficient quantity of products  or the interruption or discontinuance of operations of a manufacturer  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we do not know whether we will effectively manage our contract manufacturers or that these manufacturers will meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to transition the manufacture of some of our products from one contract manufacturer to another 
we also intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  or a reduction in the number of our contract manufacturers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as part of our cost reduction efforts  we will need to realize lower per unit product costs from our contract manufacturers by means of volume efficiencies and the utilization of manufacturing sites in lower cost geographies 
however  we cannot be certain when or if such price reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such price reductions would adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
future changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected revenue fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations a change in accounting policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred with frequency and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business 
in particular  if we are required to record stock option grants as compensation expense on our income statement  our profitability may be reduced significantly 
the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on  among other things  the historical volatility of the underlying stock 
our stock price has been historically volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price 
in addition  the adoption of such a standard could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool  which could  in turn  hurt our ability to recruit employees and retain existing employees 
compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and nasdaq stock market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  we intend to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards  and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
we have been named as a defendant in a shareholder class action lawsuit arising out of our public offerings of securities in beginning on july   purported securities fraud class action complaints were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the cases were consolidated and the litigation is now captioned as in re extreme networks  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
no 
sas sdny  related to in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas sdny the operative amended complaint is brought purportedly on behalf of all persons who purchased extreme networks common stock from april  through december  it names as defendants extreme networks  six of our present and former officers and or directors  including our ceo the extreme networks defendants  and several investment banking firms that served as underwriters of our initial public offering and october secondary offering 
subsequently  plaintiffs and one of the individual defendants stipulated to a dismissal of that defendant without prejudice 
the complaint alleges liability under sections and of the securities act of and sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  on the grounds that the registration statement for the offerings did not disclose that the underwriters had agreed to allow certain customers to purchase shares in the offerings in exchange for excess commissions paid to the underwriters  and the underwriters had arranged for certain customers to purchase additional shares in the aftermarket at predetermined prices 
the securities act allegations against the extreme networks defendants are made as to the secondary offering only 
the amended complaint also alleges that false analyst reports were issued 
no specific damages are claimed 
similar allegations were made in other lawsuits challenging over other initial public offerings and follow on offerings conducted in and the cases were consolidated for pretrial purposes 
on february   the court ruled on all defendants motions to dismiss 
the court denied the motions to dismiss the claims in our case under the securities act of the court denied the motion to dismiss the claim under section a of the securities exchange act of against extreme networks and other issuer defendants  on the basis that the complaints alleged that the respective issuers had acquired companies or conducted follow on offerings after their initial public offerings 
the court denied the motion to dismiss the claims under section a and a of the securities exchange act of against the remaining extreme networks defendants and other individual defendants  on the basis that the respective amended complaints alleged that the individuals sold stock 
we have decided to accept a settlement proposal presented to all issuer defendants 
in this settlement  plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against the extreme network defendants  in exchange for a contingent payment by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all of the ipo cases  and for the assignment or surrender of control of certain claims we may have against the underwriters 
the extreme networks defendants will not be required to make any cash payments in the settlement  unless the pro rata amount paid by the insurers in the settlement exceeds the amount of the insurance coverage  a circumstance which we do not believe will occur 
the settlement will require approval of the court  which cannot be assured  after class members are given the opportunity to object to the settlement or opt out of the settlement 
if the settlement is not approved  we cannot assure you that we will prevail in the lawsuit 
failure to prevail could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in the future 
in addition  we may become subject to other types of litigation in the future 
litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
our headquarters are located in northern california and certain of our contract manufacturers are located where disasters may occur that could disrupt our operations and harm our business our corporate headquarters are located in silicon valley in northern california 
historically  this region has been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires and floods  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our property 
we have contract manufacturers located in northern california and in mexico where similar natural disasters and other risks may disrupt the local economy and pose physical risks to our property and the property of our manufacturers 
in addition  terrorist acts or acts of war targeted at the united states  and specifically silicon valley  could cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  distributors and resellers  and customers  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
we currently do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster or catastrophic event 
in the event of such an occurrence  our business would suffer 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to successfully manage our business or achieve our goals our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales  marketing and service and operations personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with these individuals nor do we carry life insurance on any of our key personnel 
we believe our future success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales  marketing and service  finance and operations personnel 
the market for these personnel is competitive  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we have had difficulty in hiring employees  particularly engineers  in the timeframe we desire 
in addition  retention has become more difficult for us and other public technology companies as a result of the stock market decline  which caused the price of many of our employees stock options to be above the current market price of our stock 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring desired personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as new product introductions 
in addition  companies in the networking industry whose employees accept positions with competitors frequently claim that competitors have engaged in unfair hiring practices 
we have from time to time been involved in claims like this with other companies and  although to date they have not resulted in material litigation  we do not know whether we will be involved in additional claims in the future as we seek to hire and retain qualified personnel or that such claims will not result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in litigating any such claims  regardless of the merits 
our products must comply with evolving industry standards and complex government regulations or else our products may not be widely accepted  which may prevent us from growing our net revenue or achieving profitability the market for network equipment products is characterized by the need to support industry standards as different standards emerge  evolve and achieve acceptance 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet these emerging standards 
in the past  we have introduced new products that were not compatible with certain technological standards  and in the future we may not be able to effectively address the compatibility and interoperability issues that arise as a result of technological changes and evolving industry standards 
our products must comply with various united states federal government regulations and standards defined by agencies such as the federal communications commission  in addition to standards established by governmental authorities in various foreign countries and recommendations of the international telecommunication union 
if we do not comply with existing or evolving industry standards or if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates we will not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our net revenue or achieving profitability 
failure to successfully expand our sales and support teams or educate them in regard to technologies and our product families may harm our operating results the sale of our products and services requires a concerted effort that is frequently targeted at several levels within a prospective customer s organization 
we may not be able to increase net revenue unless we expand our sales and support teams in order to address all of the customer requirements necessary to sell our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate employees into our company or to educate current and future employees in regard to rapidly evolving technologies and our product families 
a failure to do so may hurt our revenue growth and operating results 
we may engage in future acquisitions that dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders  cause us to incur debt and assume contingent liabilities as part of our business strategy  we review acquisition and strategic investment prospects that we believe would complement our current product offerings  augment our market coverage or enhance our technical capabilities  or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
from time to time we review investments in new businesses and we expect to make investments in  and to acquire  businesses  products  or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future acquisitions  we could issue equity securities which would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  incur substantial debt  assume contingent liabilities  or expend significant cash 
these actions by us could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the price of our common stock 
moreover  even if we do obtain benefits in the form of increased sales and earnings  there may be a lag between the time when the expenses associated with an acquisition are incurred and the time when we recognize such benefits 
this is particularly relevant in cases where it is necessary to integrate new types of technology into our existing portfolio and new types of products may be targeted for potential customers with which we do not have pre existing relationships 
acquisitions and investment activities also entail numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies and or products  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition or investment transaction  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations  and substantial charges for the amortization of certain purchased intangible assets  deferred stock compensation or similar items 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies  or personnel that we might acquire in the future  and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may need additional capital to fund our future operations and  if it is not available when needed  we may need to reduce our planned development and marketing efforts  which may reduce our net revenue and prevent us from achieving profitability we believe that our existing working capital and cash available from credit facilities and future operations  will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we may need additional capital 
the development and marketing of new products and the expansion of reseller and distribution channels and associated support personnel requires a significant commitment of resources 
in addition  if the markets for our products develop more slowly than anticipated  or if we fail to establish significant market share and achieve sufficient net revenue  we may continue to consume significant amounts of capital 
as a result  we could be required to raise additional capital 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution of the shares held by existing stockholders 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  such securities may provide the holders certain rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of common stockholders  and the terms of such debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
we cannot assure you that additional capital  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
we significantly increased our leverage as a result of the sale of convertible subordinated notes in connection with the sale of convertible subordinated notes in december  we incurred million of indebtedness 
we will require substantial amounts of cash to fund scheduled payments of interest on the convertible notes  payment of the principal amount of the convertible notes  future capital expenditures  payments on our leases and any increased working capital requirements 
if we are unable to meet our cash requirements out of cash flow from operations  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain alternative financing 
the degree to which we are financially leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
in the absence of such financing  our ability to respond to changing business and economic conditions  to make future acquisitions  to absorb adverse operating results or to fund capital expenditures or increased working capital requirements would be significantly reduced 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  some of which are beyond our control 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay the notes at maturity  we could attempt to refinance the notes  however  no assurance can be given that such a refinancing would be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
any failure by us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the notes at maturity with respect to payments of principal or prior thereto with respect to payments of interest or required repurchases would constitute a default under the indenture and could cause a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness 
we have entered into long term lease agreements for several facilities that are currently vacant and may be difficult to sublease due to current real estate market conditions we have certain long term real estate lease commitments carrying future obligations for non cancelable lease payments net of estimated sublease income 
reductions in our workforce and the restructuring of operations during fiscal and resulted in the need to consolidate certain of these leased facilities  located primarily in northern california 
we recorded excess facilities charges of million in fiscal and million during fiscal for more information  see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements 
we intend to sublease certain of these facilities and may obtain sublease income to offset the carrying costs of these facilities 
however  based on the continuing deterioration of commercial real estate market conditions in connection with a downturn in the economy  we will not be able to sublease these facilities at the times or on the terms we anticipated when we took the excess facilities charge and therefore if the market does not improve  we may incur additional charges in the future 
in addition  we may incur additional charges for excess facilities as a result of additional reductions in our workforce or future restructuring of operations 
we will continue to be responsible for all carrying costs of these facilities until such time as we can sublease these facilities or terminate the applicable leases based on the contractual terms of the lease agreements  and these costs may have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile in the past and our stock price and the price of the notes may significantly fluctuate in the future in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
this could continue as we or our competitors announce new products  our customers results fluctuate  conditions in the networking or semiconductor industry change  or when investors change their sentiment toward stocks in the networking technology sector 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may make our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stock rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction  particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have rights prior to those of our common stock  including the common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to you or us 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our common stock and  therefore  the notes our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan  which is described below  will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  under the plan  each right will entitle stockholders to purchase a fractional share of our preferred stock for 
each such fractional share of the new preferred stock has terms designed to make it substantially the economic equivalent of one share of common stock 
initially the rights will not be exercisable and will trade with our common stock 
generally  the rights may become exercisable if a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock or commences a tender or exchange offer upon consummation of which such person or group would beneficially own or more of our common stock 
when the rights become exercisable  our board of directors has the right to authorize the issuance of one share of our common stock in exchange for each right that is then exercisable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate sensitivity the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we have invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  other non government debt securities and money market funds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash equivalents and short term investments that are subject to market risk by range of expected maturity and weighted average interest rates as of june  and june  this table does not include money market funds because those funds are not subject to market risk 
june  maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate june  maturing in three months or less three months to one year greater than one year total fair value in thousands included in cash and cash equivalents weighted average interest rate included in short term investments weighted average interest rate included in marketable securities weighted average interest rate exchange rate sensitivity currently  all of our sales and the majority of our expenses are denominated in united states dollars and as a result  we have experienced no significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
while we have conducted some transactions in foreign currencies during the year ended june  and expect to continue to do so  we do not anticipate that foreign exchange gains or losses will be significant  in part because of our foreign exchange risk management process discussed below 
foreign exchange forward contracts we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge foreign currency forecasted transactions related to certain operating expenses  denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona and the british pound 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted sfas 
at june   these forward foreign currency contracts had a notional principal amount of million fair value of 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
additionally  we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the effect of gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in japanese yen  the euro  the swedish krona and the british pound 
these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas at june   we held foreign currency forward contracts with a notional principal amount of million fair value of 
these contracts have maturities of less than days 
changes in the fair value of these foreign exchange forward contracts are offset largely by remeasurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency transaction gains from operations  including the impact of hedging  were million in fiscal foreign currency transaction losses from operations  including the impact of hedging  were million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
investments in equity securities we have historically made investments in several privately held companies 
these nonmarketable investments are accounted for under the cost method  as ownership is less than percent and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating  financing and investing activities of the investee companies 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
it is possible that we could lose our entire initial investment in these companies 
as a part of management s process of regularly reviewing these investments for impairment  we recorded write downs of million and million on certain investments  which were determined to be other than temporarily impaired in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
at june   the carrying value of our remaining investments was zero
