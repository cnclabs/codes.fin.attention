item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting estimates our timely preparation of financial reports and related disclosures requires us to use estimates and assumptions that may cause actual results to be materially different from our estimated results 
specifically  we use estimates when accounting for depreciation  amortization  cost per copy contract contingencies  useful lives for intangible assets  and asset valuation allowances including those for bad debts  inventory  and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances 
our most critical accounting estimates include the following contract contingencies our office products business leases equipment usually for a sixty month period to county wide education systems and sells the lease to third party leasing companies 
under this program the school system is billed on a monthly  quarterly or annual basis at a specified rate for each copy they make 
the cost per copy charged to the school system is designed to cover the equipment cost  supplies except for paper and staples  service  and a finance charge 
on a quarterly basis  on a program by program basis  we project an expected outcome over the life of the program 
we use historical copy usage to predict the number of copies to be made over the remaining life of the program 
we adjust this estimate of the number of expected future copies based on known factors that will influence copy rates in each program 
we use historical service and supply costs incurred on each program to estimate future service and supply costs on a per copy basis 
we adjust these estimated costs for known factors that will impact service and supplies in the future 
we also estimate any other costs expected to be incurred such as depreciation on rental equipment 
on programs where the sum of the estimated future costs exceeds the expected future revenue  we recognize a provision for of the expected losses for these programs 
intangible assets we determine the utility of goodwill and trademarks based on estimated future cash flows and test for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements 
we estimate future cash flows based on historical performance and our knowledge of known factors likely to impact future cash flows 
inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast and demand requirements for the next twelve months 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue under our current boot contract when the boots are inspected and accepted by the government s quality assurance representative qar  thereby transferring ownership to the government 
pursuant to the contract  the boots become government owned property after inspection and acceptance by the qar 
the boots are transferred and stored in our warehouse  which is a designated storage facility approved by the government  and accounted for as bill and hold sales in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as leasing activity  allowances  and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
description of business segments we have four primary business units our bar code unit operates under the name compsee  inc compsee  our office products unit operates under the name mcrae office solutions  inc office solutions  our military boot unit operates under the name mcrae footwear and our western and work boot unit operates under the name dan post boot company dan post  formerly american west trading company 
our commercial printing unit  which was discontinued in fiscal  operated under the name rae print  inc we also operate other smaller businesses 
a summary of net revenues  gross profits  selling  general and administrative expenses  and operating profits loss of our major business units for fiscal years through is presented in the following table 
certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year amounts to conform with the current year presentation 
in particular  the prior year amounts have been adjusted to reflect the discontinuance of the commercial printing unit in fiscal fiscal year percent change fiscal year over prior period dollars in thousands percent of net revenues net revenues bar code office products military boots western work boots eliminations other nm nm consolidated gross profit percentage gross profit bar code office products military boots western work boots eliminations other nm nm consolidated percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses bar code office products military boots western work boots eliminations other nm nm consolidated percentage of net revenues operating profit loss bar code office products military boots western work boots eliminations other nm nm consolidated consolidated results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net revenues for fiscal reached a record million  up from million record set for fiscal this growth in consolidated net revenues was the result of significantly higher requirements for military boots by the us government the government and increased sales of our branded western boot products 
lower net revenues in the bar code and office products businesses partially offset the net revenue increases of the footwear businesses 
consolidated gross profit for fiscal amounted to million as compared to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal these declines in consolidated gross profit were primarily the result of lower product sales prices  higher per unit manufacturing costs  changing product sales mixes  and depressed market conditions 
consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were approximately million for fiscal  an increase of over the million reported for fiscal the additional sg a costs were primarily attributable to increased sales salaries and commissions  advertising and marketing expenditures  group health insurance costs  and professional fees 
as a result of the lower gross profit and higher sg a costs  consolidated operating profit fell from million for fiscal to million for fiscal bar code unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal compsee is a manufacturer and distributor of bar code reading and printing devices  other peripheral equipment  and supplies related to optical data collection 
compsee markets  sells  and services its products primarily through sales centers located throughout the united states 
compsee continues to explore new markets throughout the united states and other parts of the world 
net revenues for the bar code business fell nearly  down from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decline in net revenues was primarily the result of competitive pressures in a depressed bar code market  the maturation of the apex ii and iii manufactured products  and the delay in getting the apex iv product to market 
we expect revenue performance to improve in fiscal as a result of a stronger economy  increased apex iv sales  and the launch of a new bar code product expected during the second half of the year 
gross profit for fiscal amounted to million as compared to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues dropped from for fiscal to for fiscal this decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to lower net revenues and a reduced proportion of higher margin manufactured products in the sales mix 
sg a expenses for fiscal were million  down from million for fiscal the decrease in sg a costs were primarily the result of effective cost containment strategies that lowered sales and administrative salaries  advertising expenditures  telephone costs  and amortization charges 
these reduced sg a costs were partially offset by higher research and development expenditures that increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal as a result of the above  the bar code business loss from operations amounted to million for fiscal as compared to a loss from operations of million for fiscal office products unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal mcrae office solutions distributes toshiba photocopiers  toshiba facsimile machines  riso digital printing equipment  oki color copiers and printers and provides related service and supplies for these products throughout north carolina and parts of virginia and south carolina 
net revenues for fiscal were million  a decline from million for fiscal our net revenue decreased as a result of lower sales to county wide educational systems 
this was partly a result of our focus on improving service to existing customers 
gross profit amounted to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in gross profit dollars as a result of lower net revenues was partially offset by increased contributions of higher margin commercial and state contract sales 
sg a expenses for fiscal amounted to million  up from million for fiscal this increase in sg a expenses was primarily the result of higher sales salaries and commissions  advertising costs  property taxes  group health insurance  and professional fees 
these expenses were partially offset by reduced research and development costs 
as a result of the above  the operating profit decreased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the office products business is an extremely competitive business 
our growth for the past several years was the result of successfully placing large quantities of office equipment in county wide education systems 
growth in this business will depend on our ability to expand our commercial market sales and to continue to successfully renew the county wide education system programs that we currently service 
military boot unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal our military boot unit manufactures and distributes military combat boots primarily to the us government the government  foreign governments  and selected commercial surplus outlets 
net revenues for fiscal totaled million  up from million for fiscal this growth in net revenues was the result of increased requirements for military combat boots by the government primarily attributable to various conflicts associated with the war on terrorism 
military boot sales to foreign governments for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal gross profit amounted to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenues  gross profit fell from for fiscal to for fiscal this decline in gross profit was primarily the result of lower sales prices  higher levels of lower margin desert boots in the overall sales mix  and increased per unit manufacturing costs 
sg a expenses for fiscal were  as compared to  for fiscal this increase in sg a costs were primarily attributable to higher administrative salaries  group health insurance costs  and professional fees 
these higher costs were partially offset by decreased sales salaries and related expenses 
as a result of the above  the operating profit for fiscal fell to million  down from million for fiscal for fiscal  we operated under several extensions of our contract with the government dated april  the government issued two solicitations for future boot requirements to replace the original contract that was set to expire on april  one solicitation covered the three current direct molded sole dms styles of military combat boots  including the standard issue all leather combat boot that has historically accounted for the majority of the government s orders under the contract 
the second solicitation covered the newly adopted infantry combat boot  which incorporates a waterproof membrane construction 
this boot replaces the previous all leather boot as the army s standard issue combat boot 
we submitted bids for both solicitations 
on march   we were advised that we did not win a contract to produce the new infantry combat boot 
on september   the government notified us that we had been awarded a new contract the contract to produce direct molded sole military combat boots 
the contract covers a base year and two one year option periods 
the contract base year provides for a minimum boot requirement of  pair and a maximum boot requirement of  pair with a minimum and maximum dollar value of approximately million and million  respectively 
the first year option provides for a minimum and a maximum boot requirement of  pair and  pair  respectively 
the second year option ranges from a minimum of  pair to a maximum of  pair 
as noted above  fiscal military boots sales to the government were million 
therefore  if in the first year of the contract the government were only to order the minimum number of boots covered by the contract  our fiscal military boot sales would be significantly lower than fiscal sales 
based on current order volume we expect the government to order significantly more than the minimum during the first year of the contract 
our contracts with the government are subject to partial or complete termination under certain specified circumstances including  but not limited to  the following for the convenience of the government  for the lack of funding  and for our actual or anticipated failure to perform our contractual obligations 
if a contract is partially or completely terminated for its convenience  the government is required to negotiate a settlement with us to cover costs already incurred 
we have never had a contract either partially or completely terminated 
however  if any such contract were either partially or completely terminated the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  the israeli government has exercised an option in its current contract with us under which we will provide approximately  pair of vulcanized combat boots for delivery in the calendar year 
western and work boot unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal our western and work boot business manufactures  imports  and sells various boot styles for men  women  and children for dress and casual wear 
net revenues for fiscal increased  up from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to strong demand for our dan post and dingo branded products 
gross profit totaled million for fiscal  an increase of over the million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for both fiscal and fiscal the increase in gross profit resulted primarily from the increased revenue for fiscal sg a expenses for fiscal amounted to million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in sg a costs resulted primarily from higher sales commissions  sales and marketing expenses  group health insurance costs  professional fees  and administrative salaries 
as a result of the above  operating profit increased from  for fiscal to million for fiscal the western and work boot market continues to be highly competitive and dynamic 
while the sluggish economy has had an impact on the western and work boot business and fourth quarter sales were down to million as compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we believe that our diversified and branded product line has us well positioned to be a major player in the western boot market in the future 
additionally  during fiscal  we plan to expand importation from china to include dingo and american west trading branded products  which should result in improved margins on these products 
consolidated results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated net revenues for fiscal climbed to a record level of million  up from the million reported for fiscal this increase in consolidated net revenues was primarily the result of higher demand for military combat boots  western boots  and office products  partially offset by a decrease in bar code business net revenues 
consolidated gross profit grew to million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved from for fiscal to for fiscal this increase in gross profit performance was primarily the result of increased revenues  lower per unit manufacturing costs  and the positive impact of increased high margin import product sales 
consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were million  an increase of over the million reported for fiscal this increase in sg a expenses was primarily attributable to higher expenditures for research and development  professional fees  office and warehouse rentals  employee benefit costs  and write offs associated with sales related computer software 
as a percentage of consolidated net revenues  sg a expenses for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal as a result of the above  consolidated operating profit increased million to million for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal our results of operations for fiscal were not impacted by the discontinuance of our commercial printing business that occurred in fiscal operating results for fiscal have been adjusted to reflect the discontinuance of the commercial printing unit 
bar code unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues for fiscal were million  a decrease of from net revenues of million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower product demand resulting from a weak economy  increased competition  and a delay in marketing the new apex iii product 
primarily as a result of reduced net revenues  gross profit fell to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was consistent at for both fiscal and indicating that demand for higher margin manufactured bar code products continued to be depressed 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were down  to million as compared to million for fiscal the decline in sg a expenses resulted primarily from lower salary and related costs associated with reduced sales  support and administrative staff 
these reductions in sg a costs were partially offset by a increase in research and development expenditures included in sg a  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal in addition  sg a expenses were impacted by our write off of our remaining  investment in software purchased in fiscal to enhance our system sales strategy 
we considered this investment to be impaired because it is no longer used in our operations 
as a result of the above  operating loss for fiscal amounted to million as compared to the operating loss of million for fiscal office products unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues for fiscal were million  an increase of over net revenues of million for fiscal this increase in net revenues resulted from the continued expansion in the number of our county wide educational programs  the successful renewal of older county wide programs using a combination of both new and used equipment for an additional sixty month period  and higher supply and service revenues attributable to the growth in the number of units in service 
gross profit for fiscal amounted to million  an increase of over the million reported for fiscal this increase in gross profit resulted from higher net revenues and improved gross margins 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues grew from for fiscal to for fiscal primarily as a result of the successful implementation of our renewal strategy associated with county wide educational programs and the increase in higher margin supply and service revenues 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal were million  up from million for fiscal this slight increase in sg a expenses was due to research and development costs of approximately  related to the continued development of our imaging software 
these expenses were partially offset by lower sales salaries  rental equipment  and advertising costs 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses were down from for fiscal to for fiscal as a result of the above  operating profit increased million  or  to  for fiscal as compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal military boot unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues for fiscal increased  to million as compared to net revenues of million for fiscal this growth in net revenues was primarily the result of increased requirements for military combat boots by the us government the government primarily related to the deployment of troops engaged in the war on terrorism 
military boot sales to foreign governments for fiscal were million as compared to million for fiscal gross profit for fiscal grew to million  up from million for fiscal the increase in gross profit was due to higher military boot sales and lower unit costs related to fixed manufacturing costs being spread over higher production levels 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased from for fiscal to for fiscal as a result of these lower unit costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal amounted to  up from  for fiscal the increase in sg a expenses was the result of additional selling expenses associated with the commercial military boot business and higher employee benefit costs 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses remained steady at for fiscal and  respectively 
as a result of the above  operating profit for fiscal grew million  to million as compared to million for fiscal western and work boot unit results of operations  fiscal compared to fiscal net revenues increased to million for fiscal  up from million for fiscal this significant growth in net revenues was primarily attributable to high demand for our dan post and dingo branded products driven in part by the company s acquisition of the dingo and dan post brand names in june and october   respectively  a slight resurgence in the western boot market  and employment of successful sales and marketing strategies 
gross profit for fiscal grew  from million for fiscal to million for the current fiscal year 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal this improvement in gross profit was primarily due to higher net revenues  the positive impact of increased sales of higher margin imported products  and increased sales prices on our manufactured products 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million higher for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of implementing a support structure to manage the significant increase in business 
specifically  we spent more for sales related salaries  commissions  warehousing costs  travel expenses  administrative salaries  employee related benefits  professional fees  product advertising costs  and bad debt charges 
as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal as a result of the above  operating profit for fiscal amounted to million  as compared to a  operating loss for fiscal financial condition and liquidity we measure our liquidity by our ability to generate cash to fund our operations  investment activities  and financing requirements 
our liquidity position is sensitive to and dependent on cash generated from operations  the level of capital expenditures  reductions in debt  payment of quarterly dividends  and adequate bank financing arrangements 
at august  cash and cash equivalents amounted to approximately million 
working capital equaled million and the current ratio  defined as current assets divided by current liabilities  was to we have two lines of credit with a bank totaling million  all of which was available at august  one credit line totaling million which is restricted to one hundred percent of the outstanding accounts receivable due from the us government expires in june the other credit line totaling million expires in november we believe that current cash and cash equivalents million at august   cash generated from operations  and the available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for fiscal we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
the table below details by fiscal year maturity dates our contractual commitments as of august  amounts in thousands commitment thereafter bank loans operating leases total selected cash flow data is presented below in thousands for years ended source use of cash august  august  operating activities net earnings adjusted for depreciation and amortization accounts receivable inventories net cash provided by operating activities investing activities purchase of trademarks capital expenditures financing activities principal repayment of long term debt dividends paid net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal totaled approximately million 
net earnings plus depreciation contributed a positive cash flow of approximately million 
the trade accounts receivable balance increased by almost  and was primarily attributable to expanded sales of military combat boots to the government 
inventory balances increased by approximately million as a result of increased demand for military boots  overages caused by a sluggish western boot market for the fourth quarter  and partially offset by the transfer of  of office equipment to fixed assets for use in the cost per copy program 
capital expenditures for fiscal amounted to approximately  primarily for manufacturing and computer equipment 
our financing activities used approximately million of cash to pay dividends and reduce our debt principal amounts 
the continued growth of the western boot business could negatively impact our liquidity 
in addition  if sales to the government under our new contract are significantly reduced from fiscal levels if the government only ordered the minimum under the contract  fiscal sales would be approximately million less than fiscal sales  or the government declines to exercise its option to extend the contract period after completion of the first year of the contract or terminates the contract  our liquidity could be adversely impacted 
inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on sales or operating results for the periods covered in this discussion

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes related to the aggregate million lines of credit and a term loan through our wholly owned subsidiary  dan post boot company 
as of august   there was no outstanding indebtedness under the lines of credit and million was outstanding on the term loan 
we do not buy or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
borrowings under these credit facilities described above bear interest at rates based upon the prime rate or the prime rate less a margin of one half percent offered by the applicable lender 
we have not entered into any swap agreements or engaged in any other hedging activities with respect to this variable rate indebtedness 
a increase in the interest rates under these credit facilities would increase annual interest expense by approximately  assuming that our aggregate borrowings under the credit facilities averaged million during a fiscal year
