restaurants open at end of year weighted average weekly sales per restaurant while management expects the company to continue to make significant progress in the performance of its restaurants in  much of the financial improvement achieved in this area will likely be offset by large increases expected in pre opening expense and interest expense as discussed below 

table of contents net sales net sales increased by approximately million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in the million of sales recorded in represented an increase of million  or  over million of sales reported in these increases were due to the opening of new restaurants in september and december of and in july of and  for  to sales increases within the company s same store restaurant base 
same store sales  which include comparable results for all restaurants open for more than months  increased by to an average of  per week in from  per week in on a base of restaurants 
same store sales averaged  per week for both and on a base of restaurants 
management estimates the average check per guest  excluding alcoholic beverage sales  was for  representing an increase of compared to menu prices for increased an estimated compared to while customer traffic guest counts on a same store basis decreased by approximately for the year 
the menu price increases for were primarily due to modest price increases implemented by the company in the last half of on selected menu items in order to increase sales and improve profitability 
while customer traffic on a same store basis decreased for  guest counts for the fourth quarter of were approximately the same as for the corresponding period of and same store sales and customer traffic increased for the first eight weeks of compared to the corresponding period of increased wine sales  which management believes are due to additional emphasis placed on the company s wine feature program  contributed to the same store sales increases in and early management estimates that the average check per guest in was and decreased by an estimated from menu prices for increased by an estimated 
compared to with guest counts on a same store basis remaining approximately the same as for management believes that continued emphasis on providing professional service combined with effective menu management will continue to build sales and increase customer traffic over time 
however  the results of these efforts may be dependent on improvement in the nation s economy and consumer confidence levels 
restaurant costs and expenses total restaurant operating expenses  as a percentage of sales  declined to in from in restaurant operating expenses were of sales in restaurant operating margins were in  in  and in the most significant factor contributing to the decrease in restaurant operating expenses in was a decrease in the cost of sales to  down from in the decrease in cost of sales was due to the impact of increased menu prices and favorable costs associated with beef  pork and poultry  which more than offset increased produce costs incurred during the year 
the company executed a twelve month beef pricing agreement which comprises approximately of the company s cost of sales effective in march which included significant price decreases as compared to the previous agreement 
the agreement was renewed effective in march for an additional twelve months 
cost of sales increased during due primarily to a significant increase in the cost of beef 
restaurant labor and related costs decreased as a percentage of sales in both and for  the favorable effect of an increase during the first quarter of the year in the tip share percentage  which servers contribute to each restaurant s tip pool  was a significant factor contributing to the decrease as additional amounts contributed to the pool reduced the hourly wage paid by the company to other employees receiving distributions under the tip pool program 
this change helped to offset the impact of increased wages associated with kitchen staff  increased payouts related to the company s restaurant level bonus program  and increases in workers compensation insurance premiums and payroll tax expense 
improved labor efficiency and lower restaurant level bonus payouts contributed to the decrease in depreciation and amortization of restaurant property and equipment decreased to of sales in from in and in the decrease in was primarily due to assets which became fully depreciated during and 
table of contents other operating expenses increased to of sales in from in and in the increase in was primarily related to increases in premiums for property and casualty insurance effective october   additional rent expense  and higher repair and maintenance expenditures 
other than increases expected in utility costs and workers compensation expense for  management believes the restaurant cost environment for the year will be generally stable 
management believes that continuing to increase sales volumes in the company s restaurants is a significant factor in improving the company s profitability  and it intends to maintain a low new restaurant development rate of one to two new restaurants per year to allow management to focus intently on improving sales and profits in its existing restaurants  while maintaining its pursuit of operational excellence 
further  the company s criteria for new restaurant development target locations with high population densities and high household incomes which management believes provide the best prospects for achieving outstanding financial returns on the company s investments in new restaurants 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses  which include all supervisory costs and expenses  management training and relocation costs  and all other costs above the restaurant level  totaled  in   in and  in the increase in general and administrative expenses for was primarily due to the inclusion of an accrual for bonuses earned by the corporate staff for the year and increases in other employee benefit obligations 
these increases more than offset decreases in travel costs and employee relocation and procurement expenses 
no bonuses for the corporate staff were accrued or paid in as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased slightly in from due to growth of the company s sales base 
decreases in management training and relocation costs  which typically comprise to of the company s total general and administrative expenses  and certain other employee benefit related expenses allowed the company to maintain total general and administrative expenses for at the prior year level by partially offsetting increases in other expenses related to the growth of the company 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to in from in due to the small decrease in expenditures and the higher sales levels achieved 
pre opening expense pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  for included primarily management training expenses incurred in connection with a new restaurant opened in the first quarter of because two restaurants were opened in  pre opening expenses were higher in that year than in and one restaurant was opened in the company plans to open two new restaurants in and as a result expects pre opening expenses to increase by  to  in compared to other income and expense net interest expense did not change significantly in compared to  as the effect of lower interest rates on the company s line of credit balances outstanding for the first ten months of the year offset the effects of higher outstanding credit line balances and additional interest expense on  of mortgage financing  which was completed in the fourth quarter of primarily as a result of higher interest rates associated with the new mortgage financing completed in  net interest expense is expected to increase by  to  in over net interest expense decreased by  during compared to primarily due to favorable interest rates on balances outstanding under the company s revolving line of credit 
other  net expense of  for   for and  for was the result of expenses associated with the retirement of facilities and equipment replaced in connection with various capital maintenance projects which more than offset miscellaneous income categories 
income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  the company had gross deferred tax assets of  and  and gross deferred tax liabilities of  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the deferred tax assets at december  relate primarily to  of tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes 

table of contents realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent principally on future earnings of the company and the recognition of these assets depends on the company s assessment of the likelihood of taxable income in future periods in amounts sufficient to realize the assets 
the deferred tax assets must be reduced through use of a valuation allowance to the extent future income is not likely to be generated in such amounts 
during and management was unable to conclude that it was more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance for of its deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  was maintained for those years 
management s conclusion was based on the losses incurred by the company in through and the fact that the company operates in a highly competitive industry with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of operating costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  which means that any decrease in same store sales could have a compounding effect in decreasing operating results 
in  the company completed its third consecutive profitable year  with pre tax income increasing significantly over the previous year 
in addition  the company has recorded significant increases in operating income in four of the last five years and has reached a size and experience level which makes it less likely that an unsuccessful new restaurant would have a significant effect on consolidated operating results 
because of these factors  management further assessed the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets  using as its principal basis its forecast of future taxable income adjusted by applying varying probability factors to the achievement of this forecast 
as the result of this assessment  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by  in the fourth quarter of  with a corresponding credit to deferred tax expense 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  which are somewhat compounded by an uncertain geopolitical environment  there can be no assurance that management s forecast of taxable income will be achieved 
the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of realization of its net deferred tax assets and will make further adjustments to the valuation allowance if deemed appropriate 
the provisions for income taxes for and resulted from federal alternative minimum tax amt and state income taxes payable 
the effective tax rates used in both years were higher than the federal statutory rate because the amt rate is applied to the company s pre tax accounting income after adding back certain tax preference items  as well as certain permanent differences and timing differences in book and tax income 
because the company maintained a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets for those years  no benefit was recognized in the income tax provisions with respect to the amt credit carryforwards or other tax assets generated during those periods 
liquidity and capital resources the company requires capital primarily for the development and construction of new j 
alexander s restaurants  for maintenance of its existing restaurants  and for meeting required debt service obligations 
the company has met these needs and maintained liquidity for the past three years primarily by use of cash flow from operations  use of a bank line of credit and  beginning in october  through borrowings under a mortgage loan 
capital expenditures totaled   and  for  and  respectively  and were primarily for the development of new j 
alexander s restaurants 
cash flow from operations exceeded capital expenditures in each of and and represented of capital expenditures for the remaining capital expenditures along with other needs for were funded primarily by use of the company s line of credit 
on october   the company obtained  of long term financing through completion of a mortgage loan transaction 
the mortgage loan has an effective annual interest rate of and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  over a period of years through november net proceeds from the mortgage loan  after deducting fees and expenses associated with the transaction  were approximately  a portion of these funds were used to pay off the outstanding balance of  on the company s bank line of credit as of october   terminating that facility 
remaining funds were invested in short term money market funds and are expected to be used primarily for retiring the company s  of convertible subordinated debentures which mature in june and for restaurant development 
the company called  of the convertible debentures for redemption at par on march  these amounts have been classified as a current liability in the company s december  balance sheet 

table of contents provisions of the mortgage loan and related agreements require that a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio be maintained for the restaurants securing the loan and that the company s leverage ratio not exceed a specified level 
the loan is pre payable without penalty after october   with a yield maintenance penalty in effect prior to that time 
the mortgage loan is secured by the real estate  equipment and other personal property of nine of the company s restaurant locations with an aggregate book value of  at december  the real property at these locations is owned by jax real estate  llc  the borrower under the loan agreement  which leases them to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company as lessee 
the company has guaranteed the obligations of the lessee subsidiary to pay rents under the lease 
jax real estate  llc  is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company which is included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  jax real estate  llc was established as a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity and maintains its own legal existence  ownership of its assets and responsibility for its liabilities separate from the company and its other affiliates 
the company currently plans to open two restaurants in  although completion of one of these restaurants is subject to certain contingencies 
management estimates that the costs to complete these restaurants and for capital maintenance for existing restaurants will be approximately million to million for in addition  the company could incur capital expenditures for the purchase of property and or construction of restaurants for locations to be opened in any such expenditures are dependent upon the timing and success of management s efforts to locate acceptable sites and would be in addition to the amounts above 
the company has periodically made purchases of its common stock under a repurchase program authorized by the company s board of directors and may continue to do so 
from june through february   the company repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately  approximately  of these shares were purchased subsequent to december   at a cost of  the company generally does not repurchase shares following the end of its fiscal quarter until after results for the quarter have been publicly announced 
while a working capital deficit of  was present as of december   the deficit decreased from  at the end of the company does not believe this deficit impairs the overall financial condition of the company because certain of the company s expenses  particularly depreciation and amortization  do not require current outlays of cash 
also  requirements for funding accounts receivable and inventories are relatively insignificant  so that virtually all cash generated by operations is available to meet current obligations 
in  the company s board of directors established a loan program designed to enable eligible employees to purchase shares of the company s common stock 
under the program  participants were allowed to borrow an amount equal to the full price of common stock purchased 
the plan authorized million in loans to employees 
purchases of stock under the plan totaled  during  with the remainder purchased in the employee loans  which are reported as a deduction from stockholders equity  are payable on december   unless repaid sooner pursuant to terms of the plan 
management believes that funds on hand following the mortgage loan transaction described above  combined with cash flow from operations  will be adequate to meet its financing needs through the upcoming year 
in addition  it is currently negotiating a new bank line of credit which would provide additional liquidity if needed to meet the company s development or working capital needs 
while management believes that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  there can be no assurance that a satisfactory credit line can be obtained 
from through  the company operated restaurants in the quick service restaurant industry 
the discontinuation of these quick service restaurant operations included disposals of restaurants that were subject to lease agreements which typically contained initial lease terms of years plus two additional option periods of five years each 
in connection with certain of these dispositions  the company remains secondarily liable for ensuring financial performance as set forth in the original lease agreements 
the company can only estimate its contingent liability relative to these leases  as any changes to the contractual arrangements between the current tenant and the landlord subsequent to the assignment are not required to be disclosed to the company 
a summary of the company s estimated contingent liability as of december   is as follows wendy s restaurants leases mrs 
winner s chicken biscuits restaurants leases total contingent liability related to assigned leases there have been no payments by the company of such contingent liabilities in the history of the company 

table of contents as of march   the company had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated affiliated entities or related parties 
additionally  the company is not a party to any financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
operating lease commitments for leased restaurants and office space are disclosed in note e  leases and note j  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth significant contractual obligations of the company at december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capitalized lease obligations operating leases capital expenditure commitments other long term obligations total capitalized lease obligations include the interest expense component 
includes renewal option periods 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its accounting for income taxes  property and equipment  impairment of long lived assets  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies are those which involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company has  of gross deferred tax assets at december   consisting principally of  of tax credit carryforwards 
generally accepted accounting principles require that the company record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will ultimately be realized 
due to losses incurred by the company from through and because the company operates with a high degree of financial and operating leverage  with a significant portion of its costs being fixed or semi fixed in nature  management was unable to conclude from through that it was more likely than not that its existing deferred tax assets would be realized  therefore  the company maintained a valuation allowance for of its deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  for those years 

table of contents in  the company completed its third consecutive profitable year  with pre tax income increasing significantly over the previous year 
in addition the company has recorded significant increases in operating income in four of the last five years and has reached a size and experience level which make it less likely that any unsuccessful new restaurant would have a significant effect on consolidated operating results 
because of these factors  management further assessed the likelihood of realization of its deferred tax assets  using as its principal basis its forecast of future taxable income adjusted by applying varying probability factors to the achievement of this forecast 
as the result of this assessment  the beginning of the year valuation allowance was reduced by  in the fourth quarter of  with a corresponding credit to deferred income tax expense 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets 
because of the uncertainties discussed above  which are somewhat compounded by an uncertain geopolitical environment  there can be no assurance that management s forecast of taxable income will be achieved and that there could not be an increase in the valuation allowance in the future 
it is also possible that the company could generate profitability and taxable income levels in the future which would cause management to conclude that it is more likely than not that the company will realize all  or an additional portion of  its net deferred tax assets 
the company will continue to evaluate the likelihood of realization of its net deferred tax assets and upon reaching any different conclusion as to the appropriate carrying value of these assets  management would adjust them to their estimated net realizable value 
any such revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the net deferred tax assets could cause the company s provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period  although its cash tax payments would remain unaffected until the benefits of the various carryforwards were fully utilized 
in addition  certain other components of the company s provision for income taxes must be estimated 
these items include  but are not limited to  effective state tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time the tax provision is prepared 
income tax returns are generally not filed  however  until several months after year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  generally including renewal options 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
because significant judgments are required in estimating useful lives  which are not ultimately known until the passage of time and may be dependent on proper asset maintenance  and in the determination of what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair or maintenance expense  changes in circumstances or use of different assumptions could result in materially different results from those determined based on the company s estimates 
impairment of long lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that long lived assets most typically assets associated with a specific restaurant might be impaired  management compares the carrying value of such assets to the undiscounted cash flows it expects that restaurant to generate over its remaining useful life 
in calculating its estimate of such undiscounted cash flows  management is required to make assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment  relative to the restaurant s future period of operation  sales performance  cost of sales  labor  operating expenses and occupancy costs  which include property taxes  property and casualty insurance premiums and other similar costs associated with the restaurant s operation 
the resulting forecast of undiscounted cash flows represents management s estimate based on both historical results and management s expectation of future operations for that particular restaurant 
to date  all of the company s long lived assets have been determined to be recoverable based on management s estimates of future cash flows 

table of contents the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive listing of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result

impact of inflation and other factors virtually all of the company s costs and expenses are subject to normal inflationary pressures and the company is continually seeking ways to cope with their impact 
by owning a number of its properties  the company avoids certain increases in occupancy costs 
new and replacement assets will likely be acquired at higher costs but this will take place over many years 
in general  the company tries to offset increased costs and expenses through additional improvements in operating efficiencies and by increasing menu prices over time  as permitted by competition and market conditions 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s revenues and net income have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
revenues and net income typically reach the highest level during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year due to holiday business and the first quarter of the fiscal year due to the redemption of gift cards sold during the holiday season 
in addition  certain of the company s restaurants  particularly those located in south florida  typically experience an increase in customer traffic during the period between thanksgiving and easter due to an increase in residents who live in these markets during this portion of the year 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated pre opening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing and cash management activities 
as of december   all of the company s outstanding long term debt was at fixed interest rates 

table of contents see notes d and e to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
the company does not expect changes in market interest rates to have a material affect on income or cash flows in fiscal  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change 
commodity price risk 
many of the food products purchased by the company are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors which are outside the control of the company 
essential supplies and raw materials are available from several sources and the company is not dependent upon any single source of supplies or raw materials 
the company s ability to maintain consistent quality throughout its restaurant system depends in part upon its ability to acquire food products and related items from reliable sources 
when the supply of certain products is uncertain or prices are expected to rise significantly  the company may enter into purchase contracts or purchase bulk quantities for future use 
the company has purchase commitments for terms of one year or less for food and supplies with a variety of vendors 
such commitments generally include a pricing schedule for the period covered by the agreements 
the company has established long term relationships with key beef  seafood and produce vendors and brokers 
adequate alternative sources of supply are believed to exist for substantially all products 
while the supply and availability of certain products can be volatile  the company believes that it has the ability to identify and access alternative products as well as the ability to adjust menu prices if needed 
significant items that could be subject to price fluctuations are beef  seafood  produce  pork and dairy products among others 
the company believes that any changes in commodity pricing which cannot be adjusted for by changes in menu pricing or other product delivery strategies would not be material
