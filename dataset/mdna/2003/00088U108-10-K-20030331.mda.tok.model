item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we serve healthcare organizations  medical professionals  health interested consumers and students as a leading publisher of visually engaging health and medical information products 
our products are used for learning about health  wellness  disease  treatments  alternative medicine  nutrition  anatomy  and for general medical reference in both the healthcare and education markets 
our products employ physician reviewed text  in house developed medical graphics and multimedia to create health information that offer a unique visual learning experience 
today  we use a growing range of media  including internet  software  cd rom  television and print  to deploy our proprietary content assets and products 
our proprietary content library  more than years in the making  includes a physician reviewed health encyclopedia that contains discussions of approximately  diseases and medical conditions   medical illustrations that have been drawn and compiled by adam  an extensive library of d models developed from the visible human project and other sources  thousands of web enabled animations depicting disease states and other medical conditions and topics  many of which are broadcast quality  interactive tools  unique technology for viewing the human body s anatomy  and an advanced content management system we have implemented 
collectively  we believe these assets represent the single largest database of proprietary health and medical related content in the world 
we believe that pictures are worth a thousand words and that illustrated approaches to explaining complex medical conditions have a significant impact on the way people understand their bodies and medical situations that affect them 
we also believe that our products will have an impact on the way patient education information is delivered and used in personal health management  prevention  disease management  and after care applications 
we believe we have the potential to capture a significant share of the consumer patient health education market with our high quality visual and text based information whether it is being distributed over the internet  as a component of point of care applications within the health care system or as printed products that can be sold and disseminated in a variety of ways including subscriptions and information prescriptions given during patient provider contacts 
consumer appetite for online health information continues to grow 
in a national survey conducted in march of  the pew internet project found that of internet users  or approximately million people  have looked online for health information 
on a typical day  about six million americans search online for medical information  meaning more people look online for health advice on any given day than actually visit a healthcare professional  according to recent figures from the american medical association 
with this consumer demand  and the proliferation of patients taking an active role with their healthcare provider in their personal care management  we believe that our products will continue to play an increasing role in the product offerings of healthcare providers particularly hospitals  the pharmaceutical industry  the health insurance and managed care industries and with large employers who are faced with rising health care costs and loss of productivity due to employee health related issues 
these organizations are actively looking for ways to improve efficiencies  increase patient encounters  and communicate better with patients  plan members and employees 
in addition  we have recognized the important role our products can have with the growing us hispanic population 
with the hispanic population rapidly approaching the largest minority group in the us  we believe that there will be an increasing need to provide health information to this important demographic segment 
new legislation requiring federally funded organizations  such as hospitals and other healthcare providers  to translate information into other languages for people with limited english proficiency  will fuel opportunities for spanish versions of our health information products 
we completed the spanish translation of our health illustrated encyclopedia  pregnancy health center  and surgeries and procedures products in during  we completed a bilingual version of our health illustrated encyclopedia 
unlike a stand alone translated product  the bilingual product is integrated and includes technology that offers the end user the ability to toggle between an english article and its equivalent  translated article in spanish 
we maintain a translation relationship with a third party vendor for editorial updates to our spanish products 
we currently provide our health content products directly and indirectly to a broad range of customers  including hospitals  pharmaceutical companies  health plans  medical device and disease management vendors  employee benefit providers  and internet portals who feature health information as part of their content offerings 
with the downturn of the dot com economy and the increased sales and marketing activities we have undertaken over the past two years  we have seen a significant shift in our revenue mix from the internet portal market to the healthcare market 
adam was incorporated in as adam software  inc we changed our name to adam 
com  inc in and to adam  inc 
in we are headquartered in atlanta  georgia 
critical accounting policies and estimates discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  product and content development expenses  bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we generate revenues mainly in two ways internet based licensing and shipped product sales 
internet revenues consist primarily of license fees that usually consist of an annual  up front fee that is initially recorded as deferred revenue 
this revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the license agreement beginning after deliver has occurred  upon customer acceptance  when we have determined that the fees from the agreement are fixed and determinable and there are no significant return or acceptance provisions 
product revenues represent the sales of software products and revenues earned under certain royalty agreements 
revenues from product sales are generally recognized at the time title passes to customers  distributors or resellers 
revenues from royalty agreements are recognized as earned based upon performance or product shipment 
sales returns allowances and allowance for doubtful accounts significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
allowances for estimated product returns are provided at the time of sale 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowances for returns primarily based upon our evaluation of historical and expected sales experience and by channel of distribution 
the judgments and estimates of management may have a material affect on the amount and timing of our revenue for any given period 
similarly  management must make estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
capitalized software development costs we capitalize internal software development costs in accordance with financial and accounting standards board fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
this statement specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product shall be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of all planning  designing  and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications including functions  features  and technical performance requirements 
we cease capitalization of internally developed software when the product is made available for general release to customers and thereafter  any maintenance and customer support is charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred 
we amortize such capitalized costs as cost of sales on a product by product basis using the straight line method over a period of two years 
we continually evaluate the recoverability of capitalized costs and if the successes of new product releases are less than we anticipate then a write down of capitalized costs may be made which could adversely affect our results in the reporting period in which the write down occurs 
we also capitalize internal software development costs in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
this statement specifies that computer software development costs for computer software intended for internal use occurs in three stages the preliminary project stage  where costs are expensed as incurred  the application development stage  where costs are capitalized  and the post implementation or operation stage  where again costs are expensed as incurred 
we cease capitalization of developed software for internal use when the software is ready for its intended use and placed in service 
we amortize such capitalized costs as cost of sales on a product by product basis using the straight line method over a period of three years 
we continually evaluate the usability of the products that make up our capitalized costs and if certain circumstances arise such as the introduction of new technology in the marketplace that management intends to use in place of the capitalized project  then a write down of capitalized costs may be made which could adversely affect our results in the reporting period in which the write down occurs 
inventory we record reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings as discussed elsewhere in this report 
currently we do not believe that these matters will have a material impact on our financial results or financial position 
this conclusion is based primarily on our insurance coverage for these matters 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or other circumstances involving these legal matters 
goodwill and intangible assets as described in note to the consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill in connection with our acquisition of imc in and nidus in in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separate from goodwill 
we have applied sfas in our allocation of the purchase price to the imc acquisition and to the nidus acquisition 
sfas requires that goodwill and other intangibles that have an indefinite life are no longer to be amortized but are to be tested for impairment at least annually 
in assessing impairment we must make judgments and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective net assets 
other factors that could cause impairment could result from a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge for the recorded goodwill 
we conducted the impairment test for fiscal and concluded no impairment had occurred 
since we did not have any goodwill recorded prior to the imc and nidus acquisitions  the provision of sfas requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill will have no impact on our ongoing operating results or the comparability of such results with prior periods 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management estimating the actual tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and us gaap purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  an expense is recorded within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
variable stock options in march  the fasb issued financial interpretations no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 

this opinion provides guidance on the accounting for certain stock option transactions and subsequent amendments to stock option transactions 
fin was effective july   but certain conclusions cover specific events that occur after either december  or january  we have from time to time since granted stock options to our employees to purchase shares of our common stock 
certain of these options were canceled at the option of their holders on january   and then replaced that day on a one for one basis with new options with an exercise price equal to the closing market price that day 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for this interpretation requires variable accounting treatment for options that have been modified from their original terms 
accordingly  compensation cost shall be adjusted for increases or decreases in the intrinsic value of the modified awards in subsequent periods and until the awards have been exercised  forfeited  or expired 
as of december   we have  outstanding options with an exercise price of that are considered variable under this interpretation 
because the stock price since the effective date of july  has been below  we have not recorded any compensation cost related to the repriced options issued on january  should our stock price climb above our operating results will be affected until the stock options are either exercised or forfeited and could adversely affect any reporting period in which the variable accounting is required 
any charges that result from these variable options would be non cash operating expenses and will be reported on a separate line item 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas and sfas sfas is effective for any business combinations initiated after june   while sfas became effective for us commencing january  sfas generally requires us to use the purchase method to account for any acquisitions initiated after june  and eliminates the pooling of interest methods 
our adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we have applied sfas in our allocation of the purchase price to the imc and nidus acquisitions 
sfas affects how we account for goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in both previous and any future acquisitions 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill associated with acquisitions made after june  sfas also requires an impairment test on goodwill be performed at least annually beginning in we performed the impairment test during the test was based on cash flow and earnings projections  and did not result in an impairment charge 
since we did not have any goodwill recorded prior to the imc and nidus acquisitions  the provision of sfas requiring companies to stop amortizing goodwill did not have an impact on our ongoing operating results or the comparability of such results with prior periods 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  but retains its fundamental provisions for recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and those to be disposed of by sale 
we adopted this standard as of january   the result of which did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the emerging issues tax force eitf issued eitf income statement characterization of reimbursements for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf requires companies to characterize reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses as revenues in the statement of operations 
we adopted the provision of eitf on january  and it did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements nos 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other things  this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of the related income tax effect 
as a result  the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
 reporting the results of the operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  which requires gains and losses on extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations  will now be applied 
we will adopt this new standard effective january  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues relating to the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities  and nullifies the guidance in eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we will adopt this new standard effective january  in november  the fasb issued sfas interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of the interpretation are effective for financial statements of periods that end after december  however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment to sfas sfas provides two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for stock based compensation 
further  the statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
these disclosures are not required for interim periods in addition to the traditional annual disclosure 
the amendments to sfas  which provides for additional methods  are effective for periods beginning after december   although earlier application is permitted 
the amendments to the disclosure requirements are required for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  in january  the fasb issued sfas interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin expands upon existing accounting guidance that addresses when a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities  and activities of a variable interest entity 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
