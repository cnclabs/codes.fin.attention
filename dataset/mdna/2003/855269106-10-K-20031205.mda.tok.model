at the end of these contracts  the company seeks to replace the expiring contracts with similar contracts 
however  the company can provide no assurances it will be able to continue to do so in the future 
to mitigate this potential exposure  the company generally structures its facility leases and vendor supply contracts to correspond with the terms of its gm contracts 
due to the lack of availability of suitable buildings  the oshawa  ontario  canada lease is ten years compared to a five year program life for the other plants 
the company is currently dependent upon one customer and contractual agreements with this customer 
the terms of the agreements are tied to the customer s anticipated life of the vehicle chassis

such factors include  without limitation  the following general operating contingencies 
the company may not be able to attract and retain employees with sufficient skills to conduct its operations efficiently and may from time to time be subject to work slow downs or stoppages 
the company may be adversely affected by delay or unavailability of supply of numerous component parts 
the company will not always be able to satisfy its capital requirements with internally generated funds and may  from time to time  need to rely on bank financing and other third party capital resources

the company may have less experience manufacturing and marketing such acquired products than it has in its business 
there is no assurance that such new acquisitions will be profitable 
economic conditions 
the level of disposable consumer income affects the company s sales because its products are generally considered discretionary expenditures by consumers 
in difficult economic times  consumers tend to spend less of their income on discretionary items 
other economic factors affecting the demand for the company s products include the availability and price of gasoline  the level of interest rates and the availability of consumer financing 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued reduced gasoline availability could adversely affect the demand for the company s products 
a significant increase in the price of gasoline could reduce demand for the company s products because it would increase the cost of operating these products 
because many consumers finance their purchase of vehicle conversions  the availability of financing and level of interest rates can affect a consumer s purchasing decision 
a decline in general economic conditions or consumer confidence can be expected to affect the company s and tecstar s sales adversely 
oem automotive supply segment 
all of the company s oem automotive supply sales in  and were to gm 
the company s oem automotive supply sales are directly impacted by the size of the automotive industry and gm s market share 
further  gm periodically reduces production or closes plants for several months for model changeovers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and continuing into the second quarter of fiscal  one of the company s manufacturing facilities was substantially shut down as a result of gm s model changeover 
this adversely affected the company s fiscal and results 
a decline in sales in the automotive market or in gm s automotive sales  or production cutbacks and plant shut downs for model changeovers by gm  could have an adverse impact on the company s sales and profits 
sales of the oem automotive supply segment are subject to long term contracts with gm 
continued sales and growth of this segment is subject to the company s ability to continue to satisfactorily perform and to obtain such contracts over time 
the company s contractual agreements with its customer may be shortened or extended by the customer at its discretion 
there is no assurance that the company s contractual agreements will remain in effect for the stated periods

as the company s sole customer is gm  there is no assurance that the company s sales and margins will not be adversely affected by this program 
regulation 
the company is subject to various foreign  federal  state and local regulations 
the company must comply with certain federal and state regulations relating to the disposition of hazardous wastes generated in its production processes 
the company s failure to comply with applicable regulations or changes in current regulations  including the adoption of new safety or environmental standards  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition 
the oem automotive supply business is also highly competitive with several large companies competing in this market 
there is no assurance the company will be able to maintain its current competitive position in this market 
potential product liability and warranties 
like other automotive manufacturers  the company may be subject to claims that its products caused or contributed to damage or injury sustained in vehicle accidents or may be required to recall products deemed unsafe 
any such claims in excess of the company s insurance coverage or material product recall expenses could adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
it is possible that actual expenses the company incurs to honor warranties on products could exceed the warranty liability accrued on its books for such expenses  which could adversely affect its results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  operations of the company are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currencies 
these fluctuations can vary the cost of financing  investment yields and operations of the company 
the company does not have any investments that would be classified as trading securities under generally accepted accounting principles 
the company s non trading investments  excluding cash and cash equivalents  consist of certificates of deposit and debt securities 
these financial instruments are subject to market risk in that changes in interest rates would impact the market value of such investments 
the company generally does not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values 
based on the company s overall interest rate exposure at september   including variable rate debt  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the financial instruments as of september   would have no material impact on earnings or cash flows over a one year period 
the company s foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the canadian dollar 
the company faces transactional currency exposures that arise when its foreign subsidiaries enter into transactions  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
the company also faces currency exposure that arises from translating the results of its canadian operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have used financial derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
during fiscal  the company incurred a million foreign currency gain
