during the year ended december   a month to month lease with a related party was terminated on a facility resulting in a write off of million for the unamortized leasehold improvements related to the facility 
in june  we subleased the memphis facility for the period july  through september   the end of the lease commitment

overview we are a leading hospital focused clinical laboratory  performing highly advanced  clinically useful testing services for hospitals  laboratories and physician specialist communities nationwide 
we believe we offer the most comprehensive menu of esoteric assays in the industry  with a test menu of more than  assays 
many of our tests have been developed through our internal research and development efforts 
esoteric assays are complex  comprehensive or unique tests used to diagnose  evaluate and monitor patients 
these assays are often performed on sophisticated instruments by highly skilled personnel and are therefore offered by a limited number of clinical laboratories 
our primary customers are hospitals  independent clinical laboratories and physicians 
we have aligned our interests with those of hospitals  our fastest growing client segment  by not competing in the routine test market that provides them with a valuable source of revenue 
we educate physicians on the clinical value of our assays through our information oriented marketing campaigns 
our technical  experienced sales force concentrates on the hospitals and independent laboratories that serve as distribution channels for physician assay orders 
we use our advanced information technology solutions to accelerate and automate electronic ordering and results reporting with these customers 
through the execution of our hospital focused strategy  we grew rapidly in recent years 
for the three years through  our net revenue grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 
this growth was supplemented with the acquisition of bbi clinical laboratories  inc  in the first quarter of bbi clinical laboratories  a private company founded in  was a leading esoteric clinical reference laboratory specializing in infectious disease testing  such as lyme disease and viral hepatitis 
bbi clinical laboratories primary customers included hospitals  physician specialists  pharmaceutical and diagnostic companies  and other clinical and research laboratories 
while the core hospital focus strategy remains the same  was marked by two significant events the regulatory actions taken by the california department of health services cdhs and the federal centers for medicare medicaid services cms in march and april  and the announcement of the acquisition of unilab corporation  our largest customer  by quest diagnostics inc  one of our competitors 
as a result of these events  we have experienced a significant reduction in revenues for these events are discussed below 
by letter dated march   cdhs notified us of its intent to impose sanctions of a directed plan of correction  random onsite monitoring  and a civil money penalty based upon deficiencies cited on november  following laboratory inspections conducted during june and october the sanctions were based on findings that we were permitting unlicensed personnel to perform and supervise clinical laboratory testing in violation of california law 
we filed supplemental documentation supporting our compliance with the applicable requirements with cdhs and cms on april  in addition  on april   we requested that cdhs rescind its proposed sanctions outlined in the march  letter based on our supplemental submission 
in may and june  cdhs conducted additional unannounced inspections  and we provided additional documentation supporting our compliance with cdhs requirements 
by letter dated june   and amended on july   cdhs indicated that we were in substantial compliance with california clinical laboratory law 
cdhs also imposed sanctions of a civil money penalty of  per day for days ie   plus  for the cost of conducting their investigations  and imposed onsite monitoring for three years  including unannounced inspections 
we did not appeal these imposed sanctions 
by letter dated april   cms notified us of its conclusions regarding laboratory inspections in june and october conducted by cdhs 
cms concluded that our february response to deficiencies detected in the inspections did not constitute a credible allegation of compliance 
as a result  cms imposed certain sanctions  including notice of revocation of our clinical laboratory improvement act clia certificate  cancellation of our approval to receive medicare and medicaid payments for services performed  imposing a civil money penalty of  per day for each day during the sanction period  and imposing a directed plan of correction by which cms could notify our customers of our non compliance and the nature and effective date of any sanctions imposed 
we filed an appeal to the cms action on april   and the appeal stayed the revocation of our clia certificate during our administrative appeal 
the cancellation of medicare and medicaid payments was effective for services performed by us on and after february  on july   cms notified us that it had deemed specialty in compliance with all condition level requirements of clia as of june   that specialty s ability to bill medicare and medicaid for its testing services has been reinstated as of june   and that all actions against our clia certificate were rescinded 
in order to facilitate an immediate resolution with cms  we elected to withdraw the appeal of the sanctions we filed with cms on april   and we will not seek reimbursement for services performed for beneficiaries of medicare and medicaid during the sanction period of february  through june  however  because cms had imposed its sanctions retroactively to february   we had billed medicare and medicaid programs for some services before we were notified of the actual imposition of the sanctions by cms on april  we have sought guidance from cms as to how the period of retroactive sanctions should be treated  and we have set aside and reserved those medicare or medicaid payments from the period of february  through april  until we receive additional guidance from cms 
we did not challenge cms imposition of a monetary fine of  representing  per day during the sanction period 
we believe that the cancellation of our approval to receive medicare and medicaid payments for services performed from february  through june  did not affect testing for medicare and medicaid patients for whom we bill our hospital and other clients  but instead applies only to testing for which we bill the medicare and medicaid programs directly 
on april   quest diagnostics  inc announced that they had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire unilab corporation 
unilab  our largest customer  comprised approximately and of our net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result  unilab did not renew the three year agreement with us  which expired in october of  and we experienced a significant decline in testing volumes sent to us from unilab after expiration of the contract 
in october  we entered into a new agreement with unilab which should allow for a more orderly reduction of the remaining test volumes 
with the completion of unilab s acquisition in february  we believe that quest will perform the majority of testing previously sent to us by unilab 
in march  unilab provided us notice that it would stop sending us certain tests covered under the new agreement 
while we believe that there will continue to be a logical wind down of testing sent to us  we do expect it to have a significant negative impact on our accession volumes in as a result of these significant events on our business  on june   we announced a reduction in workforce totaling as part of an overall restructuring plan 
the plan involved all areas and levels of the company 
in connection with the restructuring effort  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of the charge comprised severance payments and related obligations for employees whose positions were eliminated 
during september  as a result of further business review and the refinement of our core strategic business  we eliminated some employee positions primarily in the area of our clinical trials department 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of the charge comprised severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and the write off of certain assets related to our clinical trials business 
in november  in our continuing efforts to manage costs and align our staff with current business levels  we had a reduction in workforce focused primarily on the laboratory 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of  which comprised severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and for the write off of certain capitalized costs associated with the delayed move to our new valencia facility and the related termination of the synthetic lease financing arrangement with the banking group led by bnp paribas 
other significant developments included as previously reported  in december  we purchased a acre site in valencia  california 
we are in the process of building a  square foot facility which would enable us to consolidate all of our laboratory and administrative functions in one location 
construction began during the second quarter of and was to be completed in the second half of in october  we announced that we would postpone the move to our new facility in valencia until the first half of accordingly  the construction of the new facility will be paused 
this postponement will allow us to focus on rebuilding client confidence and stabilizing our business by minimizing any disruptions in service to our clients based on planning and executing a move to a new facility during this rebuilding period 
we have halted construction at completion of the core and shell of the facility  a logical break point  and this phase was substantially completed in january upon restart of the facility construction  we plan to fund completion with traditional construction and mortgage financing 
we expect to decide whether and when to recommence the facility s construction sometime in the last half of however  we can provide no assurances that we will be able to obtain financing on favorable terms to fund construction of the new facility  that we will have the ability to complete a move to a new facility without incurring disruptions in service to our customers and loss of client confidence  or that we will need a larger facility for our operations in light of our reduced testing volume and employee headcount 
based on these and other factors  it is possible that we may never recommence construction of the new facility in valencia  or decide to recommence construction after december  if we do not provide notice of our intent to resume construction prior to that date  the agreement for construction of the facility will be deemed terminated  and we could be subject to substantial termination costs and penalties  which could be in excess of million 
for more information  please see risk factors our planned move to valencia  california may divert management attention and may lead to disruptions in our operations and service to our customers and risk factors we may decide to further postpone or cancel our planned move to a new location in valencia  which could create financial liabilities 
in march  we completed a million financing transaction 
this credit facility had two components first  we entered into a year lease to finance construction of our new laboratory and headquarters facility in valencia  california  sometimes referred to as a synthetic lease  with a total cost  including financing costs  of up to million  and second  we entered into a million line of credit with the same lenders that provided the lease financing  with proceeds available for general corporate purposes 
prior to this transaction  we had an existing line of credit of million  which was provided by union bank of california 
the new credit facility  arranged by bnp paribas  included union bank  us bank  first union national bank  as co syndication agents  and allied irish banks  manufacturers bank  and bank leumi  usa  as participants 
as a result of our decision to pause construction of the valencia facility and our desire to have on balance sheet financing  we exercised our purchase option in the fourth quarter under the lease finance agreement  paying off the debt so we can obtain title to the ground lease and facility improvements  thus ending the synthetic lease 
subsequently  we also terminated our line of credit with this bank group 
on april   james b 
peter  md  md  resigned from the positions of chairman and chief executive officer 
on may   we announced that douglas s 
harrington  md was named chief executive officer 
dr 
harrington has more than years of laboratory services and diagnostic devices industry experience 
he served as chief executive officer of chromavision medical systems from to  held various executive positions at nichols institute including president and laboratory director  is board certified in anatomic  clinical pathology and hematology  and is fully licensed as a clinical laboratory director 
dr 
harrington has served on our board of directors since as announced on april   thomas r 
testman was elected by our board of directors to serve as chairman 
mr 
testman  a retired managing partner with ernst young since  has served on our board of directors since on may   we announced that novation  a national purchasing group for hospitals  discontinued its service agreement with us 
the termination of the agreement was without cause and was effective on july  the original agreement was initiated on may  and provided novation members with access to discounted clinical laboratory services from us 
while we have experienced some loss of novation clients  the exact consequences of the agreement s termination are difficult to predict  particularly since the termination of the contractual relationship with novation does not prevent its members from using our services  and it may take a significant period of time before any individual novation member decides to stop utilizing our services 
on june   we announced the appointment of terrance h 
gregg to our board of directors 
mr 
gregg  former president of medtronic minimed  brings more than years of healthcare experience to the board 
he assumes the board seat vacated by paul f 
beyer who resigned as our president and chief operating officer as announced on june  on july   we announced the appointment of mark r 
willig to the position of vice president  sales 
mr 
willig has nearly years of experience in the diagnostics and clinical reference laboratory industries  and more recently served as vice president of sales at myriad genetics from until joining specialty 
on october   we announced that john c 
kane resigned from our board of directors 
on november   we announced the appointment of michael c 
dugan  md to the position of vice president and co laboratory director 
dr 
dugan previously served as chief of pathology and medical director of clinical laboratories at santa monica ucla medical center and has held multiple staff appointments as part of the affiliated pathologists medical group  one of the largest pathology groups in california 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized as services are rendered upon completion of the testing process for a specific customer order for which we have no future performance obligation to the customer  the customer is obligated to pay and the fees are non refundable 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
services are provided to certain patients covered by various third party payor programs including medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payor programs are included in net revenue net of allowances for differences between the amounts billed and estimated receipts under such programs 
adjustments to the estimated payment amounts based on final settlement with the third party payor programs are recorded upon settlement 
during the second quarter of  we did not recognize any net revenue related to medicare and medicaid services  this is a result of cms canceling our approval to receive medicare and medicaid payments for services performed during the sanction period of february  through june  with the resolution of sanctions imposed by cms  in the third quarter of  we resumed the recognition of net revenue related to medicare and medicaid services performed subsequent to june  expense recognition expenses are recognized as incurred and are generally classified as cost of services or selling  general and administrative expenses 
components of cost of services include salaries and employee benefits  research and development costs  supplies and reagents  courier costs  depreciation of laboratory equipment and leasehold improvements 
selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries and employee benefits  sales and marketing  information technology  insurance and bad debt expense 
stock based compensation charges stock based compensation charges represent the difference between the exercise price of options granted  or the price of stock sold to employees and directors  and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date of grant or sale in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
and its related interpretations 
in the case of options  we recognize this compensation charge over the vesting periods of the options using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
for purposes of the period to period comparisons included in results of operations  selling  general and administration expenses exclude these stock based compensation charges  which are reflected as a separate line item 
we have recorded deferred stock based compensation related to unvested stock options granted to employees and directors 
based on the number of outstanding options granted as of december   we expect to amortize approximately  of deferred stock based compensation in future periods 
we expect to amortize this deferred stock based compensation approximately as follows  during  and  during we anticipate that the exercise price of stock options granted after the calendar year of will be at the reported market price of our common stock  and therefore no deferred stock based compensation will result from these grants 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net revenue cost of services selling  general and administrative exclusive of stock based compensation charges restructuring charge charge related to regulatory matters operating income loss income loss before income taxes benefits net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue net revenue decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenues for the current year were impacted primarily from the loss of customers and reduction of customer volumes as a result of the uncertainty related to our regulatory matters that were resolved in the third quarter of the reduction in revenues occurred across our entire customer mix  but was most significant in business from other independent laboratories excluding unilab  our largest customer and physician direct business  which declined by approximately  while testing referred from our hospital clients declined approximately 
in addition  as a part of the sanctions imposed by the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  we were suspended from receiving reimbursement for medicare and medicaid services for the period of february  through june   and million of net revenue for these services was not recognized in the year 
while our regulatory matters were resolved in the third quarter of  and we believe that the significant customer volume loss related to this matter has ended  the recently completed acquisition of unilab  our largest customer comprising approximately of our revenues in  by quest diagnostics will result in a further decline in total revenues in  and this decline could be significant 
on march   unilab provided us notice that it would stop sending us certain tests covered under a new agreement we reached with them in october the year over year revenue decline is reflected in a drop in accession volumes of approximately  as accessions were nearly million for the year ended december  as compared to more than million for the prior year 
this volume decline is coupled with a year over year decline in the aggregate average selling price of nearly 
this drop in the aggregate average selling price is due primarily to our continued client mix shift towards hospital based business and the reduction in independent laboratory business  as revenues from hospitals grew to nearly of total revenues for the year ended december  as compared to approximately for the year ended december  with our continued focus on growing our hospital client base  coupled with the expected loss of business from unilab during  we expect a further decline in the aggregate average selling price for  but at a much more modest rate 
this projected decrease  however  is dependent on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the rate of loss of unilab business  no additional significant losses of other independent laboratory business  and any significant change in price competition within the hospital market 
cost of services cost of services  which includes costs for laboratory operations  distribution services  and research and development  increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
this increase is primarily the result of operational changes implemented during the year ended december  to ensure compliance with personnel licensing and other regulatory requirements  and to allow for rapid resolution of these regulatory concerns 
as a result  certain cost increases were temporary increases needed for rapid resolution  while other operational changes will have ongoing cost increases 
the most significant temporary cost increase was for outsourced testing 
in april  we suspended more than one thousand tests to ensure full and immediate compliance with personnel licensing requirements for our laboratory 
the orders we continued to receive for the suspended tests were forwarded to other laboratories for processing 
this operational change resulted in an increase of costs for outsourced testing  adding more than million to cost of services in as compared to the prior year period 
with the successful hiring  training  and certification of additional california licensed personnel during third quarter  we reinstated nearly tests as of october  this reinstatement of tests resulted in a significant decline in outsourcing costs for the fourth quarter  and we believe will result in a decline of outsourcing costs in of more than million 
in addition  we incurred cost increases in associated with the hiring  training  and certification of licensed laboratory personnel  adding approximately million to total cost of services 
while we believe these costs were temporary  and do not expect to incur this level of expenditures in  this reduction is dependent on our successful retention of these new personnel  and no significant turnover in our laboratory workforce in also  approximately  of one time costs were incurred in cost of services associated with the subleasing of our memphis facility for the period july  through september  as part of ongoing changes made to ensure compliance with california requirements for licensed personnel  we now only use california licensed clinical laboratory scientists to perform the analytical portions of clinical testing 
this change adds approximately  per quarter of incremental ongoing costs 
for the period ended december   additional costs of approximately million were incurred for this change in personnel as compared to the year these increases are partially offset by lower reagent  distribution and royalty costs due to lower accession volumes 
as a percentage of revenue  cost of services increased to for the year ended december  from from the comparable prior year period 
selling  general and administrative expenses exclusive of stock based compensation charges selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a decreased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period 
this decrease is due primarily to a reduction in salary and benefit costs of approximately million as a result of our restructuring and reduction in force announced in june and an approximate million reduction in certain sales and marketing costs  such as commissions and bonuses  that declined commensurate with our lower revenues 
in addition  approximately million of s  g a costs were incurred during the year ended december  for the acquisition and operation of bbi clinical laboratories facility in connecticut  in which we ceased operations in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for year as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
we expect s  g a costs will decline further in due to the ongoing benefits of our restructuring efforts and anticipated lower revenues  resulting in a decrease of approximately million as compared to the full year this decrease assumes no significant increases in certain costs such as insurance and taxes  and that we do not have a significant increase in revenues 
stock based compensation charges stock based compensation charges decreased from approximately million for the period ended december  to a net credit of approximately  for the period ended december  this decrease was primarily due to forfeited stock options resulting from the june and november reductions in workforce that had the effect of reducing future amortization 
restructuring charge on june   we announced a reduction in workforce totaling as part of an overall restructuring plan 
in connection with the restructuring effort  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of the charge comprised severance payments and related obligations for employees whose positions were eliminated 
during september  as a result of further business review and the refinement of our core strategic business  we eliminated some employee positions primarily in the area of our clinical trials department 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of the charge comprised  of severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated and a  write off of certain assets related to our clinical trials business 
in november  in our continuing efforts to manage costs and align our business with current business levels  we had a reduction in workforce focused primarily on the laboratory 
we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of approximately  of severance payments for employees whose positions were eliminated was recorded as a charge 
in addition  during the fourth quarter  we recorded a charge of  for the write off of certain capitalized costs associated with the delayed move to our new valencia facility  and the related termination of the synthetic lease financing arrangement with the banking group led by bnp paribas 
approximately million of severance and related obligations have been paid as of december  the remaining severance costs of approximately million will be paid during and charge related to regulatory matters in april  we received a letter from cms imposing certain sanctions as a result of laboratory inspections conducted by cdhs in june and october the sanctions included cancellation of medicare and medicaid payments for services performed by the company on and after february  and a civil money penalty of  per day for each day during the sanction period beginning on february  on july  we were informed by cms that it had deemed specialty to be in compliance with all condition level requirements of clia as of june  and that specialty s ability to bill medicare and medicaid for its testing services had been reinstated as of june  in addition  the july letter from cms notified us of a civil money penalty of  per day for each day during the sanction period from february  through june  in order to facilitate an immediate resolution with cms  we elected to withdraw our appeal of the sanctions we filed with cms on april   and we will not seek reimbursement for services performed for beneficiaries of medicare and medicaid during the sanction period of february  through june  however  because cms imposed its sanctions retroactively to february   we billed medicare and medicaid programs for some services before we were notified of the actual imposition of the sanctions by cms on april  we have sought guidance from cms as to how the period of retroactive sanctions should be treated  and we have set aside and reserved those medicare or medicaid payments from the period of february  through april  until we receive additional guidance from cms 
we did not challenge cms imposition of a monetary fine of  representing  per day during the sanction period 
we have recorded a charge relating to these actions of approximately million for the period ending december  a charge of million is comprised of million to reserve for medicare and medicaid services earned and billed for the period of february  to march  with the remaining balance for regulatory fines  inspection costs  and incremental legal expenses related to the cdhs and cms regulatory actions 
in pursuing patient collections  information was subsequently provided by the patient or our client that the services provided were covered by medicare or medicaid during the period of february through june   resulting in us writing off these receivables 
these write offs along with additional reserves  totaled  and were recorded as a charge during fourth quarter of interest income expense  net net interest income decreased to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net interest income of approximately million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the significant interest rate declines that occurred during  resulting in lower interest yields on our investments coupled with cash utilized to finance our new facility construction and upgrade our information technology infrastructure 
provision for income taxes benefits provision for income taxes benefits was a benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to million in expense for the year ended december  our effective tax rate for the full year of was as compared to for the prior year period 
the decline in the effective tax rate is a result of certain non deductible costs  such as penalties  incurred in and the limitation of loss deductions in the state of california 
net income loss a net loss of million was recorded for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the comparable prior year period  a decrease of approximately million 
the decrease is primarily due to significant one time charges including severance costs and related costs due to restructurings and reductions in workforce totaling approximately million  charges related to the cms actions of nearly million  and lost revenues from medicare and medicaid of approximately million 
in addition  these results reflect the impact of increased outsourced testing costs totaling approximately million for as compared to the prior year period 
this decrease in is also related to our year over year reduction of nearly in our aggregate average selling price due to our client mix shift toward hospital based business and the reduction in independent laboratory business 
as a percentage of net revenue  a net loss of was recorded for the year ended december  as compared to net income of for the comparable prior year period 
ebitda ebitda reflected a loss of million for the year ended december  as compared to earnings of million for the comparable prior year period 
as a percentage of net revenue  ebitda decreased to a loss of for the year ended december  from earnings of for the comparable prior year period 
the decrease is primarily due to significant one time charges including severance costs and related costs due to restructurings and reductions in workforce totaling approximately million  charges related to the cms actions of nearly million  and lost revenues from medicare and medicaid of approximately million 
in addition  these results reflect the impact of increased outsourced testing costs totaling approximately million for as compared to the prior year period 
this decrease is also related to our year over year reduction of nearly in our aggregate average selling price due to our client mix shift toward hospital based business and the reduction in independent laboratory business 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  revenue grew as a direct result of increased accession volumes  which increased nearly to more than million assays for the year as compared to million assays for the year  offset partially by a decline in average selling prices 
this accession growth came primarily from our existing business  increasing approximately during the year as compared to the comparable prior year period 
the accession volumes resulting from the acquisition of bbi clinical laboratories on february  accounted for nearly two percentage points of growth 
average selling prices for the year of declined approximately as compared to the prior year of this reduction in average selling prices is reflective of test mix changes resulting from our growing hospital customer base  pricing reductions in contract renewals  and the impact on test mix in september and october due to the events of september revenues from our hospital clients grew to approximately of total net revenues for the year ended december  as compared to approximately for the year ended december  as a direct result of our continued sales focus towards hospital customers 
cost of services cost of services  which includes costs for laboratory operations  distribution services  and research and development  increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
this increase is directly attributed to the increase in assay volume and the costs associated with the acquisition of the clinical operations of bbi clinical laboratories in first quarter during the year  we maintained redundant operations as we transitioned the clinical operations of bbi clinical laboratories to our santa monica facilities 
the transition of laboratory operations was completed during the third quarter of as a percentage of net revenue  cost of services increased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable prior year period 
this decline is reflective of the additional costs associated with the bbi clinical laboratories acquisition offset partially by the improved efficiencies provided by the ongoing automation of our laboratory operations and the economies of scale realized by processing significantly higher assay volume 
selling  general and administrative expenses exclusive of stock based compensation charges selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the prior year period 
selling  marketing and related expenses accounted for approximately million of this growth in s  g a resulting from increased revenues and servicing a larger customer base 
the acquisition of bbi clinical laboratories added more than million to s  g a  which includes approximately  of certain charges associated with the acquisition and approximately  recorded for amortization of intangible assets during the year of approximately million was due to increasing our corporate infrastructure to support our business growth and to meet the requirements of being a public company 
expansion of our customer related offerings of datapassportmd and the beta testing of our outreach express contributed nearly million of incremental s  g a 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to for year as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
stock based compensation charges stock based compensation charges were million for both the years ended december  and these charges are related to the amortization of deferred stock compensation 
write down of unused facilities a property lease between the company and a partnership in which the company s chairman of the board and chief executive officer  dr 
james b 
peter  was both a direct and indirect owner was terminated on september  on which date the company had a balance of approximately  in unamortized leasehold improvements for this property 
a loss for this amount was recognized on september  no additional losses were recorded during interest income expense  net net interest income increased to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to net interest expense of approximately  for the year ended december  the increase in interest income is the result of investments being made with the proceeds from our initial public offering held in december as funds have been invested in money market  short term and long term investments 
the decrease in interest expense is due to the reduction of debt in december paid by proceeds from our initial public offering 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the comparable prior year period 
our effective income tax rate declined slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the effective tax rate decline is a result of tax planning reviews and initiatives 
net income net income increased by million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the comparable prior year period 
the increase is due primarily to an increase in operating income resulting from higher assay volume  efficiencies provided by ongoing automation of assays  and interest income recognized on the investment of funds from our initial public offering 
as a percentage of net revenue  net income increased to for the year ended december  as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
ebitda ebitda increased by approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable prior year period 
as a percentage of net revenue  ebitda increased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable prior year period 
these results reflect the efficiencies provided by ongoing automation of assays  economies of scale associated with processing significantly higher assay volume partially offset by us maintaining redundant operations as we transitioned the clinical operations of bbi clinical laboratories to our santa monica facilities 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities for the year ended december  used net cash of million as we incurred a net loss from operations of million offset by million of depreciation and amortization  million of tax benefits generated from the exercise of employee stock options  and million of cash provided by accounts receivable collections 
in addition  cash was used as a result of an increase in our tax benefits  as reflected in income taxes refundable of million 
this compares to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  for  million of cash was provided by income from operations  increased by million of depreciation and amortization  million of tax benefits generated from the exercise of employee stock options  and million increase in deferred income taxes 
this was offset  in part  by million of reductions in accounts payable  income taxes payable and other current liabilities 
investing activities for the year ended december  provided net cash of million as we repositioned approximately million of short term and long term investments to cash and cash equivalents  offset by approximately million increase in capital expenditures 
this represents a million increase in capital expenditures from the comparable prior year period 
this increase is primarily due to the million for construction of the new valencia facility which we financed by using million of cash and investments  and million of funds borrowed from bnp paribas which were repaid in fourth quarter of of the remaining capital expenditures  approximately million was expended for the upgrade of our information technology infrastructure and the move of our data center to a third party location which will be completed during the first half of this compares to a cash use of million for the year ended december   as we repositioned approximately million of cash to short term and long term investments  paid million in cash for the acquisition of bbi clinical laboratories  paid million to acquire land in valencia  california for our new facility  and spent million for capital expenditures to expand our information technology platform and laboratory automation and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the prior year period 
cash provided in the year of was primarily from the receipt of funds from the purchase of common stock by employees through our employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options 
in addition  we borrowed million of funds from the bank group led by bnp paribas for our new facility construction 
we decided to go on balance sheet with the valencia facility lease transaction and we exercised our purchase option under the agreement 
during fourth quarter of  we paid off the bank loan so we could obtain title to the ground lease and facility improvements  and thus ended the synthetic lease financing arrangement 
the building is recorded in property and equipment on our balance sheet 
in march  we also obtained a bank loan agreement that provided for a revolving line of credit up to million 
the banking group led by bnp paribas also provided this loan agreement 
we had no borrowings under this bank loan agreement and terminated this loan agreement in fourth quarter of we expect to complete a new  reduced financing arrangement within the next three months and expect the new agreement will provide the right to borrow up to million for the valencia facility 
with the resolution of sanctions imposed by cms and cdhs  our focus is on rebuilding client confidence and stabilizing our business 
to minimize any disruptions in service to our customers based on planning and executing a move to a new facility during the rebuilding period  in october  we announced that we would postpone the move to our new facility in valencia until the first half of accordingly  the construction of the new facility will be delayed 
we have halted construction at completion of the core and shell of the facility  a logical break point  and this phase was substantially completed in january with the remaining work of this phase concluding during february and march we estimate incurring approximately million of additional capital expenditures in the first quarter of for these purposes 
during the construction postponement period  we expect to see an increase in operating costs to provide security  insurance  maintenance  and fund taxes  amounting to approximately  per quarter 
the decision to restart the building project will occur sometime in the second half of if we decide to restart the facility construction  we will look to a more traditional construction and mortgage financing arrangement to complete the project 
our cash and cash equivalents combined with short term and long term investments totaled approximately million on december  as compared to million on december  this reduction in cash is a direct result of increased capital expenditures  primarily for the valencia facility and information technology investments that are related to our infrastructure upgrade and the move of our data center to a third party location 
our investments  accounting for million  are primarily in commercial paper and corporate bonds 
we expect existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and our new financing arrangement will be sufficient to fund our operations  meet our capital requirements to support our growth and allow strategic technology licensing for the next year 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing shareholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at any time  fluctuations in interest rates could effect interest earnings on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our existing line of credit
