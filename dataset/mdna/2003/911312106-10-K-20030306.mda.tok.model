domestic package operations compared to us domestic package revenue decreased million  or  for the year 
this decrease was driven by a decrease in average daily package volume  and partially offset by a increase in revenue per piece 
the decline in volume was a result of the impact of volume diversion to competitors in connection with the agreement reached on a new six year contract with the international brotherhood of teamsters  combined with the continued weakness in the us economy 
the decline in volume was most pronounced in the period surrounding the july  expiration date of the existing contract 
on january   we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential charge increased to over the commercial ground rate  and this charge also was applied to express deliveries 
the additional delivery area surcharge  which is added to ground deliveries in certain less accessible areas  remained at  and also was applied to express deliveries 
rates for ups hundredweight increased 
we also increased rates for ups next day air  ups next day air saver  ups nd day air  and day select an average of 
the surcharge for ups next day air early am increased from to 
rates for international shipments originating in the us ups worldwide express  ups worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups standard service increased an average of 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout the year and varied by geographic market 
an index based fuel surcharge continued during the index based surcharge  which resets on a monthly basis  replaced a fixed fuel surcharge of  which was originally implemented prior to the current surcharge is based on the national us average on highway diesel fuel prices as reported by the us department of energy 
based on published rates  the average fuel surcharge for the year ended december  was 
approximately million in revenue was recorded in as a result of our fuel surcharge  a decrease of million from the prior year 
us domestic package operating profit decreased million  or  for the year ended december  operating profit was affected by a non recurring benefit to operating expense of million that occurred in related to a change in our vacation policy for non union employees 
excluding this item  us domestic package operating profit decreased million  or for the year  due to the decrease in average daily volume discussed previously and an increase in operating expenses discussed further below 
in  
table of contents we recorded a credit to expense related to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act  which benefited the us domestic package segment by million 
compared to us domestic package revenue was flat in compared to  primarily as a result of a decrease in average daily package volume  offset by a increase in average revenue per piece 
the decrease in volume resulted from the declining us economy during for the first quarter of  average daily domestic volume was up 
however  average daily domestic volume was down during the second quarter  down during the third quarter  and down during the fourth quarter 
the third quarter decline was largely a result of the events of september also affecting the comparison were two extra operating days in compared to during the first quarter of  we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential charge increased to over the commercial ground rate  and we increased rates for ups next day air  ups next day air saver  ups nd day air  and day select an average of 
the surcharge for ups next day air early am increased from to 
rates for international shipments originating in the us ups worldwide express  ups worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups standard service increased by 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us were made throughout and varied by geographic market 
in addition  all package rates during  until december th  included a fuel surcharge 
effective december   we implemented an index based surcharge  which initially reduced the surcharge rate to and resets on a monthly basis 
approximately million in revenue was recorded in as a result of our fuel surcharge  an increase of million over the prior year 
us domestic package operating profit decreased by million due primarily to the decline in volume discussed previously 
this decrease was mitigated by cost control initiatives implemented during the year 
these initiatives focused on many of our semi variable costs and included curtailing non union hiring  eliminating new consulting projects  reevaluating all capital expenditures and information technology projects in process  plus a variety of other items 
international package operations compared to for the year ended december   international package revenue improved million  or currency adjusted  due primarily to volume growth for our export products and strong revenue per piece improvements 
this volume growth was driven primarily by the europe region  which had an increase in average daily export volume of  and the asia pacific region  which had an increase in average daily export volume of 
in total  international package average daily volume increased and average revenue per piece increased currency adjusted 
the improvement in operating profit for our international package operations was million for the year 
in  operating profit benefited from an million reduction to expense related to the change in vacation policy 
excluding the effect of this item  operating profit increased by million  or for the year  million of which was due to currency fluctuations 
the increase in operating profit was primarily due to export volume growth of and a strong increase in revenue per piece 
in addition  the shutdown of the us west coast ports during the latter part of had a beneficial impact on our international package results 
in  this segment benefited by million from the elimination of goodwill amortization 
in  operating profit benefited from a million credit to expense related to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
compared to the increase in international package revenue in was due primarily to an increase in cargo revenue and a volume growth for our export products  offset by a decline in the revenue per piece for these 
table of contents products 
the increase in cargo revenue resulted primarily from increased volume  which was driven by the integration of our challenge air operations in latin america 
our europe region was a significant contributor to the export volume increase 
excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  average revenue per piece increased 
overall average daily package volume increased over for international operations 
the decline in the operating profit of our international package operations during resulted primarily from increased expenses  particularly those expenses associated with aircraft used in this segment maintenance  rental and fuel as we continued to add airlift capabilities to further expand our international presence 
we recorded million of goodwill amortization in our international package segment in both and non package operations compared to non package revenue increased million  or  during of this revenue growth was due to acquisitions and the remaining was organic 
ups logistics group revenue was up million or for the year  of which approximately half was due to acquisitions 
ups freight services revenue grew million  or  primarily due to having a full year of revenue from fritz companies inc  which we acquired in may revenue growth at ups freight services was hindered by the sale of the fedex brokerage business in march adjusting for the effect of this sale  freight services would have reported organic revenue growth of approximately during non package operating profit decreased by million  or  for the year 
operating profit was affected by a restructuring charge and related expenses of million primarily related to the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations  and an million reduction to expense related to a change in our vacation policy 
excluding the impact of these items  non package operating profit increased by million  or 
in  this segment benefited from a million reduction in goodwill expense as a result of the elimination of goodwill amortization 
non package operating profit includes million compared to million in of intersegment profit  with a corresponding amount of operating expense  which reduces operating profit  in the us domestic package segment 
compared to the increase in non package revenue in resulted primarily from the impact of acquisitions  particularly fritz  which was included in our freight services unit 
non package revenue also increased due to the continued growth of the ups logistics group 
the logistics group revenue increase was primarily due to increases in our supply chain management and service parts logistics offerings 
other non package revenue also increased as a result of acquisitions first international bancorp and mail boxes etc  offset by a decrease in third party air operations revenue due to the discontinuation of our charter passenger services 
the decrease in non package operating profit was partially due to the million gain we recognized from the sale of our ups truck leasing subsidiary in the first quarter of the remaining decrease was due to start up  integration and operating costs for several subsidiaries that we were developing or acquired  along with goodwill amortization expense associated with acquisitions 
during  we recorded million of goodwill amortization in our non package segment  which was an increase of million over non package operating profit included million compared to million in of intersegment profit 
operating expenses and operating margin compared to consolidated operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  in  operating expenses were affected by the million restructuring charge and related expenses in our non package segment  and the million credit to expense related to the change in our vacation policy 
excluding the effect of these items  operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year 

table of contents excluding the million credit to expense related to the change in vacation policy  compensation and benefits increased by million  or  for the year  primarily due to increased costs associated with health and retirement benefits 
other operating expenses increased by million  or  excluding the million restructuring charge and related expenses 
the non package segment accounted for million of the million total increase in operating expenses 
this was principally due to acquisitions that we completed during the first nine months of in  operating expenses benefited from the absence of million of expense related to the elimination of goodwill amortization 
in  other operating expenses were reduced by million for compensation under the air transportation safety and system stabilization act 
adjusting for the effects of the restructuring charge and related expenses and vacation policy change  our operating margin  defined as operating profit as a percentage of revenue  decreased from during to during this decline is primarily due to a basis point decline in the operating margin for our us domestic package segment  which experienced a volume driven decline in profit 
compared to in  operating expenses increased by billion  or  with compensation and benefits up million and other operating expenses up million 
the increase in compensation and benefits included a million reduction in pension benefits expense 
depreciation and amortization and other occupancy expenses primarily rent and utilities accounted for over one half of the increase in other operating expenses 
much of the increase in operating expenses was related to expanding our capabilities and service offerings for our non package segment 
excluding the non package segment  operating expenses increased by over depreciation and amortization expense included million of goodwill amortization  a million increase from our adjusted operating margin declined from for to for this decline continued the trend that began in the fourth quarter of as the economy began to weaken 
investment income interest expense compared to the decrease in investment income of million for is primarily due to a combination of lower interest rates and lower balances available for investment 
compared to the decrease in investment income of million for is due to two factors relating to first  in the first quarter of  we recognized a million gain on investments held by our strategic enterprise fund in two companies that were acquired by other companies 
in addition  we earned income on the billion in net ipo proceeds available for investment prior to the tender offer that occurred in early march  and the billion in ipo proceeds that were not utilized for the tender offer 

table of contents net income and earnings per share compared to net income for was billion  an increase of million from billion in  resulting in an increase in diluted earnings per share to in from in adjusting for the non recurring fas cumulative expense adjustment  net of tax  of million  our net income in would have been billion  or per diluted share 
in  our results were affected by the fourth quarter restructuring charge and related expenses of million  the non recurring fas cumulative expense adjustment of million  the credit to compensation and benefits resulting from the change in our vacation policy for non union employees of million  and the credit related to the reversal of a portion of the previously established tax assessment liability of billion 
excluding the impact of these non recurring items  our net income would have been billion  or per diluted share compared to in 
compared to net income for amounted to billion  or per diluted share  compared to billion  or per diluted share  for our results reflected certain non recurring items  which include the gains on our strategic enterprise fund investments and the sale of our truck leasing subsidiary  offset partially by a charge for retroactive costs associated with creating new full time jobs from existing part time teamster jobs 
our results reflect a fas cumulative expense adjustment  net of tax  of million 
excluding these non recurring transactions for each of these periods  adjusted net income for would have been billion  a decrease of million from adjusted net income of billion for adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased from in to in liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations 
we maintain significant cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and short term investments  amounting to billion at december  as part of our continuing share repurchase program  billion was authorized for share repurchases in february  of which million was still available as of december  we maintain two commercial paper programs under which we are authorized to borrow up to billion 
approximately billion was outstanding under these programs as of december   all of which was classified as a current liability 
the average interest rate on the amount outstanding at december  was 
in addition  we maintain an extendible commercial notes program under which we are authorized to borrow up to million 
no amounts were outstanding under this program at december  we maintain two credit agreements with a consortium of banks that provide revolving credit facilities of billion each  with one expiring on april  and the other expiring on april  interest on any amounts we borrow under these facilities would be charged at day libor plus basis points 
there were no borrowings under either of these agreements as of december  we also maintain a billion european medium term note program 
under this program  we may issue notes from time to time  denominated in a variety of currencies 
at december   billion was available under this program 
we have a billion shelf registration statement under which we may issue debt securities in the us there was approximately billion issued under this shelf registration statement at december  as of december   million in notes have been issued under the ups notes program 
these notes have various terms and maturities  all with fixed interest rates 
the notes are callable at various stated times after issuance  and million of the notes have been called since the inception of the program 
as of december   million in ups notes were outstanding 

table of contents on august   the united states tax court held that we were liable for tax on income of overseas partners ltd 
opl  a bermuda company that had reinsured excess value ev package insurance purchased by our customers beginning in  and that we were liable for additional tax for the and tax years 
the court held that for the tax year we were liable for taxes of million on income reported by opl  penalties and penalty interest of million  and interest for a total after tax exposure estimated at approximately million 
the irs took similar positions to those advanced in the tax court decision for tax years subsequent to based on the tax court decision  we estimated that our total after tax exposure for tax years through could have been as high as billion 
in our second quarter financial statements  we recorded a tax assessment charge of billion  which included an amount for related state tax liabilities 
the charge included taxes of million and interest of million 
this assessment resulted in a tax benefit of million related to the interest component of the assessment 
as a result  our net charge to net income for the tax assessment was billion  increasing our total after tax reserve at that time with respect to these matters to billion 
the tax benefit of deductible interest was included in income taxes in  however  since none of the income on which this tax assessment was based was our income  we did not classify the tax charge as income taxes 
we determined the size of our reserve with respect to these matters in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in  we estimated our most likely liability based on the initial tax court decision 
in making this determination  we concluded that  based on the tax court decision  it was more likely that we would be required to pay taxes on income reported by opl and interest  but that it was not probable that we would be required to pay any penalties and penalty interest 
in our prior estimation  if penalties and penalty interest ultimately were determined to be payable  we would have had to record an additional charge of up to million 
further  as a result of the unfavorable tax court decision  and in order to stop the potential accrual of additional interest that might ultimately have been determined to be due to the irs  on august  we paid billion  and on august  paid an additional million  to the irs related to these matters for the through tax years 
we included the profit of the ev insurance program  using the irs s methodology for calculating these amounts  for both and in filings we made with the irs in in february  we paid million to the irs related to these matters for the through tax years 
on june   the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit reversed the tax court s decision 
on september   the eleventh circuit denied the irs s petition to have the appeal reheard en banc 
the irs did not appeal the case to the us supreme court and  consequently  the case was remanded to the tax court to consider alternative arguments raised by the parties 
in january  we and the irs finalized settlement of all outstanding tax issues related to ev package insurance 
under the settlement of these issues  we agreed to adjustments that will result in income tax due of approximately million  additions to tax of million and related interest 
the amount due to the irs as a result of the settlement is less than amounts we previously had accrued as described above 
as a result of the settlement  we recorded income  before taxes  of billion million after tax during the fourth quarter of the refunds and credits associated with this settlement are expected to occur over the next several years 
the ev program that was the subject of the tax court decision has been changed since september the revised arrangement should eliminate the issues considered by the tax court and the eleventh circuit related to opl 
the irs has proposed adjustments  unrelated to the ev package insurance matters discussed above  regarding the allowance of deductions and certain losses  the characterization of expenses as capital rather than ordinary  the treatment of certain income  and our entitlement to the investment tax credit and the research tax credit in the through tax years 
the proposed adjustments would result in million of additional income tax expense 
the irs has also issued a report taking a similar position with respect to 
table of contents some of these issues for each of the years from through that report proposes adjustments that would result in million in additional income tax expense 
in november  the irs issued a report taking a similar position with respect to some of these issues for each of the years from through that report proposes adjustments that would result in million in additional income tax expense 
for the through tax years  unpaid interest on these adjustments through december  could aggregate up to approximately million  after the benefit of related tax deductions 
we expect that we will prevail on substantially all of these issues 
specifically  we believe that our practice of expensing the items that the irs alleges should have been capitalized is consistent with the practices of other industry participants 
the irs may take similar positions with respect to some of these issues for each of the years through the irs s proposed adjustments include penalties and penalty interest 
we believe that the possibility that such penalties and penalty interest will be sustained is remote 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these issues will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we are named as a defendant in pending lawsuits that seek to hold us liable for the collection of premiums for ev insurance in connection with package shipments since based on state and federal tort  contract and statutory claims  these cases generally claim that we failed to remit collected ev premiums to an independent insurer  we failed to provide promised ev insurance  we acted as an insurer without complying with state insurance laws and regulations  and the price for ev insurance was excessive 
these actions were filed after the august  tax court decision 
as discussed above  on june   the us court of appeals for the eleventh circuit ruled in our favor and reversed the tax court decision 
these cases have been consolidated for pre trial purposes in a multi district litigation proceeding mdl proceeding in federal court in new york 
the court has ruled on the motions to dismiss  granting our motions with respect to all of the plaintiffs tort claims and all of their breach of contract claims prior to august  claims asserted under specific federal statutes  and breach of contract claims commencing on august   may proceed at this time 
we intend to continue to seek dismissal of these remaining claims 
the defendants in the mdl proceeding  including ups  have stipulated to conditional certification of a plaintiff class in most of the lawsuits challenging the ev insurance program for our shippers 
class certification is a procedural step that allows claims to be resolved at one time as to all potential claimants  it does not depend on or reflect the merits of the underlying claims 
defendants may move later to set aside or modify the class certification 
the cases subject to the class certification stipulation will proceed to a single trial before the federal court presiding over the mdl proceeding  instead of being returned for trial to the numerous federal courts around the country from which they were transferred 
in addition  plaintiffs in the five cases with pending motions to remand to state court have withdrawn these motions 
in addition to the cases in which ups is named as a defendant  there also is an action  smith v 
mail boxes etc  against mail boxes etc 
and its franchisees relating to ups ev insurance purchased through mail boxes etc 
centers 
this case also has been consolidated into the mdl proceeding 
the plaintiff has moved to have the case remanded back to state court 
we believe that the allegations in these cases have no merit and intend to continue to defend them vigorously 
the ultimate resolution of these cases cannot presently be determined 
in addition  we are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business 
we believe that the eventual resolution of these cases will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
due to the events of september   increased security requirements for air carriers may be forthcoming  however  we do not anticipate that such measures will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  our insurance premiums have risen and we have taken several actions  including self insuring certain risks  to mitigate the expense increase 

table of contents as of december   we had approximately  employees of our total employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the teamsters 
on october   the teamsters ratified a new master agreement with ups that runs through july  the new agreement is retroactive to august  the majority of our pilots are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the independent pilots association  which becomes amendable january  our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with teamsters local  which becomes amendable on november  in addition  the majority of our ground mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
these agreements run through july  in november  we announced rate increases  which took effect on january   that are in line with previous rate increases 
we increased rates for standard ground shipments an average of for commercial deliveries 
the ground residential surcharge increased to over the commercial ground rate 
the additional delivery area surcharge added to residential deliveries in certain less accessible areas increased to 
rates for ups hundredweight increased 
in addition  we increased rates for ups next day air an average of and increased rates for deferred services by 
rates for international shipments originating in the us ups worldwide express  ups worldwide express plus  ups worldwide expedited and ups international standard service increased an average of 
rate changes for shipments originating outside the us generally are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market 
the index based fuel surcharge remains in effect  and currently is 
we believe that funds from operations and borrowing programs will provide adequate sources of liquidity and capital resources to meet our expected long term needs for the operation of our business  including anticipated capital expenditures such as commitments for aircraft purchases  through following is a summary of capital expenditures in millions buildings and facilities aircraft and parts vehicles information technology we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately billion in these expenditures will provide for replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth and include the projected cost of capitalized software 
a discussion of our anticipated future payments under operating leases  capital leases  debt obligations  and purchase commitments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a discussion of our unfunded lending commitments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices  foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and equity prices 
all of these market risks arise in the normal course of business  as we do not engage in speculative trading activities 
in order to manage the risk arising from these exposures  we utilize a variety of foreign exchange  interest rate  equity and commodity forward contracts  options  and swaps 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate risk  and equity price risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in exchange rates  interest rate yield curves  and commodity and equity prices 
for options and instruments with non linear returns  models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to 
table of contents determine the impact of market shifts 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk we are exposed to an increase in the prices of refined fuels  principally jet a  diesel  and unleaded gasoline  which are used in the transportation of packages 
additionally  we are exposed to an increase in the prices of other energy products  primarily natural gas and electricity  used in our operating facilities throughout the world 
we use a combination of options  swaps  and futures contracts to provide some protection from rising fuel and energy prices 
these derivative instruments generally cover forecasted fuel and energy consumption for periods up to one year 
the net fair value of such contracts subject to price risk  excluding the underlying exposures  as of december  and was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of these derivative contracts  assuming a hypothetical change in the underlying commodity price  would be approximately million at december  this amount excludes the offsetting impact of the price risk inherent in the physical purchase of the underlying commodities 
foreign currency exchange risk we have foreign currency risks related to our revenue  operating expenses  and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate 
we are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency denominated assets  liabilities  and cash flows 
our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the euro and the british pound sterling 
we use a combination of purchased and written options and forward contracts to hedge cash flow currency exposures 
as of december  and  the net fair value of the hedging instruments described above was an asset liability of approximately and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value for such instruments from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million at december  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel shift in the foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
the assumption that exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
interest rate risk as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have various debt instruments  including debt associated with capital leases  that are issued at fixed rates of interest 
such financial instruments are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair value of our total long term debt  including current maturities  at december  and was and billion  respectively 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately million at december  we use a combination of derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps  as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
these swaps are entered into concurrently with the issuance of the debt that they are intended to modify  and the notional amount  interest payment  and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt 
interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt 
the net fair value of our interest rate swaps at december  and was an asset liability of and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately million at december  
table of contents as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have certain investments in securities that are purchased at fixed rates of interest 
at december  and  the fair value of our investments in debt securities was and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately million at december  additionally  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we hold certain finance receivables  primarily commercial loans and finance leases  at fixed rates of interest 
these assets are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
at december  and  the fair value of our investments in finance receivables was billion and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be approximately million at december  equity price risk we hold investments in various equity securities that are subject to price risk  and for certain of these securities  we utilize options to hedge this price risk 
at december  and  the fair value of such investments was and million  respectively 
the potential loss in the fair value of such investments  assuming a decline in equity prices net of the offsetting impact of any hedges  would be approximately million 
credit risk the forward contracts  swaps  and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default 
future accounting changes in june  the fasb issued statement no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that such liabilities be recognized when incurred 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated on or after january  as discussed in note  we implemented a restructuring program involving the integration of our freight services and logistics group operations in the fourth quarter of as this restructuring program was initiated in  we accounted for this restructuring program using the existing guidance in eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
therefore  the adoption of fas on january  had no effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge and related expenses in the amount of million  which is classified in other operating expenses 
in  we plan to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas  which is considered the preferable accounting method for stock based employee compensation 
under fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we have elected to adopt the measurement provisions of fas using the prospective method 
under this approach  all future employee stock option grants and other stock based compensation will be expensed to compensation and benefits over the vesting period based on the fair value at the date the stock based compensation is granted 
we will continue to provide pro forma income and earnings per share information related to prior awards 
the expensing of stock based compensation is expected to reduce diluted earnings per share by approximately in by  we expect to realize the full impact of adopting fas  and estimate that diluted earnings per share will be reduced by approximately in that year 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that a liability be recognized at fair value at the inception of certain guarantees for the obligations undertaken by the guarantor 
fin also requires additional disclosures for certain guarantee contracts 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements ending after december   while the recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin provides guidance on the identification of variable interest entities  and the assessment of a company s interests in a variable interest entity to determine whether consolidation is appropriate 
fin requires the consolidation of a variable interest entity by the primary beneficiary if the entity does not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and is effective for periods beginning after june  for existing variable interest entities 
as we have no material exposures to special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements  we anticipate that the effects of adopting fin will not be material to our results of operations or financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as indicated in note to our consolidated financial statements  the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on prior experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable to our circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements 
while estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts  we believe that the following matters may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
contingencies as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  we are involved in various legal proceedings and contingencies 
we have recorded liabilities for these matters in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
fas requires a liability to be recorded based on our estimate of the probable cost of the resolution of a contingency 
the actual resolution of these contingencies may differ from our estimates 
if a contingency is settled for an amount greater than our estimate  a future charge to income would result 
likewise  if a contingency is settled for an amount that is less than our estimate  a future credit to income would result 
goodwill impairment the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas in june as a result of the issuance of this new standard  goodwill is no longer amortized  but is subjected to annual impairment testing 
goodwill impairment testing requires that we estimate the fair value of our goodwill and compare that estimate to the amount of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet 
the estimation of fair value requires that we make judgments concerning future cash flows and appropriate discount rates 
our estimate of the fair value of goodwill could change over time based on a variety of factors  including the actual operating performance of the underlying reporting units 
upon adoption of fas  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million per diluted share  as of january   related to our mail technologies business

the recorded levels of these reserves are determined by outside actuaries  who incorporate historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim 
trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of such reserves 
we believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate  however actual experience in claim frequency and or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations 
pension and postretirement medical benefits the company s pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions
