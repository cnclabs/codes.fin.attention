broadwing inc and its majority owned subsidiaries over which it exercises control the company  is a full service local and national provider of data and voice communications services  and a regional provider of wireless communications services 
the company provides services on a national level by combining its national optical network and internet backbone and its local network with a well regarded brand name and reputation for service 
the company operates in four business segments broadband  local  wireless and other 
a further discussion of these segments and their operating results is discussed in item  business  and in the individual segment discussions which begin on page of this report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
the company continually evaluates its estimates  including but not limited to those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  fixed assets  access line costs  restructuring  reciprocal compensation  pensions  other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies impact its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
for a more detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue as services are provided 
local service revenue is billed monthly  in advance  with revenue being recognized when earned 
both switched voice and data and internet product revenue are billed monthly in arrears  while the revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
while customers are billed in advance for month to month broadband transport services  revenue is recognized as the services are provided 
revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon performance of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation or customer acceptance 
indefeasible right of use agreements  or irus  represent the lease of network capacity or dark fiber and are recorded as unearned revenue at the earlier of the acceptance of the applicable portion of the network by the customer or the receipt of cash 
the buyer of iru services typically pays cash upon execution of the contract  and the associated iru revenue is then recognized over the life of the agreement as services are provided  beginning on the date of customer acceptance 
in the event the buyer of an iru terminates a contract prior to the contract expiration and releases the company from the obligation to provide future services  the remaining unamortized unearned revenue is recognized in the period in which the contract is terminated 
for long term construction contracts  the company recognizes revenue and the associated cost of that revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
the method is used as the company can make reasonably dependable estimates of revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract 
as the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates that are continually assessed throughout the terms of the contracts  revenue recognized is subject to revision as the contract nears completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revisions have the potential to impact both revenue and cost of services and products 
construction projects are considered substantially complete upon customer acceptance 
pricing of local services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition and other public policy issues 
different interpretations by regulatory bodies may result in adjustments to revenue in future periods 
the company monitors these proceedings closely and adjusts revenue accordingly 
since its merger with ixc communications inc ixc in november the merger  the company has not entered into any significant fair value fiber exchange agreements 
for certain preacquisition fiber exchange agreements with other carriers  the company recognizes the fair value of revenue earned and the related expense in offsetting amounts over the life of the agreement 
in no instances has the company recognized revenue upon consummation of any such fiber exchange agreements or capitalized any expenses associated therewith 
deferred tax asset as of december   the company had approximately million of federal operating loss tax carryforwards with a related tax benefit of million 
in addition  the company had approximately million in deferred tax assets related to state and local operating loss tax carrryforwards 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence available in determining whether there is reasonable assurance that its deferred tax assets will be realized 
in performing this evaluation  the company considers future taxable income projections  expirations of loss carry forwards and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
based on this evaluation as of december   which included the uncertainty regarding the future operations of the company s broadband segment  the company determined that realization of certain deferred tax assets including federal and state operating loss carryforwards was not considered to be more likely than not  and therefore provided a valuation allowance  which amounted to  million as of december  the valuation allowance was recorded as a component of income tax expense in the fourth quarter of the company is pursuing several alternatives and the resolution of uncertainties related to bci that may result in the realization of these reserved tax assets 
allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company determines the estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a variety of factors including the length of time receivables are past due  the financial health of customers  and historical experience 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate or other circumstances occur that result in an impairment of customers ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
depreciation the company uses the straight line method to depreciate its property  plant  and equipment 
due to rapid changes in technology  significant judgment is required in determining the estimated useful life of telecommunications plant and equipment 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price consideration over the fair value of assets acquired recorded in connection with purchase business combinations  primarily the merger with ixc  in november indefinite lived intangible assets consist primarily of fcc licenses of the wireless segment 
upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas on january   the company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  million  net of tax  and ceased amortization of remaining goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as discussed in note pursuant to sfas  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
for goodwill  a two step impairment test is performed 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is in excess of the implied fair value of that goodwill  then an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carry value 
if the carrying value of an indefinite lived asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in and  goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of to years  with the vast majority being amortized over years 
indefinite lived intangible assets were amortized on a straight line basis over estimated useful lives of to years 
impairment of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles as of december   the company had fixed assets with a net carrying value of million 
the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed an impairment assessment of its broadband segment long lived assets 
this assessment considered all of the contemplated strategic alternatives for the broadband segment  including a potential sale of assets  using a probability weighted approach 
based on this assessment  it was determined that the long lived assets of the company s broadband segment unit were impaired and  accordingly  the company recorded a billion non cash impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of these assets 
of the total charge   million related to tangible fixed assets and million related to finite lived intangible assets 
pension and postretirement benefits the company calculates net periodic pension and postretirement expenses and liabilities on an actuarial basis under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expense and liability related to these plans 
key actuarial assumptions are presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
the discount rate is selected based on current market interest rates on high quality  fixed rate debt instruments at december of each year 
the health care cost trend rate is based on actual claims experience and future projections of medical cost trends 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact both costs of services and products and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the participant s benefit horizons  the mix of investments held directly by the plans  which is generally equities and bonds  and the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets and the market related value of plan assets are used to calculate the expected return on plan assets 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns and therefore result in a pattern of income and expense recognition that more closely matches the pattern of the services provided by the employees 
for the market related value of plan assets  the company uses a calculated value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
a five year moving average value is used for equities and high yield bonds due to the volatility of these types of investments and fair value is used for low yield bonds 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
the company recognized pretax income of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to its pension plans 
in addition  the company recognized pretax expense of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to its postretirement health and life benefits 
the company s cash flows from operations included uses of cash of million  million and million related to its pension and postretirement plans in  and  respectively 
changes in actual asset return experience and discount rate assumptions can impact the company s stockholders equity 
actual asset return experience results in an increase or decrease in the asset base and this effect in conjunction with a decrease in the pension discount rate may result in a plan s assets being less than a plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo 
the abo is the present value of benefits earned to date and is based on past compensation levels 
the company is required to show in its consolidated balance sheet a net liability that is at least equal to the abo less the market value of plan assets 
this liability is referred to as an additional minimum pension liability aml 
an aml  which is recorded and updated on december each year  is reflected as a long term pension liability with the offset in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet on a net of tax basis and or as an intangible asset to the degree a company has unrecognized prior service costs 
the key assumptions used in developing the pension and postretirement plan expense were the discount rate of and expected long term rate of return on plan asset of 
holding all other assumptions constant  a decrease in the discount rate of basis points or a decline in assets of or some combination thereof  would have caused an aml equity charge of approximately million  net of tax 
a decrease in the discount rate or asset value in could have a similar impact 
for pension and postretirement expense  the company will use a discount rate of and a long term rate of return on plan assets of 
during  the value of the assets held in the company s pension and postretirement trusts decreased approximately as general equity market conditions deteriorated and benefit payments continued 
the asset decline is expected to increase the company s non cash operating expenses by approximately million 
the company does not expect to make cash funding contributions to the pension trust in  but anticipates a cash contribution of approximately million in restructuring during and  the company recorded restructuring charges representing direct costs of exiting certain product lines  including certain contractual lease commitments  and involuntary employee terminations 
these charges were recorded in accordance with eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and represent the company s best estimate of undiscounted liabilities at the date the charges were taken 
adjustments for changes in assumptions are recorded in the period such changes become known 
changes in assumptions  especially as they relate to contractual lease commitments  could have a material effect on the restructuring liabilities and consolidated results of operations 
results of operations during the first quarter of  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its cincinnati bell directory cbd subsidiary  which was previously reported in the other segment

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
to manage its exposure to interest rate fluctuations  the company uses a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financial instruments 
the company employs derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
for a more detailed discussion of the company s use of financial instruments  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december  the company was  however  required by terms of its credit facility to engage in interest rate swaps once certain thresholds were exceeded with regard to floating rate debt as a percentage of the company s total debt 
the company exceeded this threshold during and  accordingly  entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements on notional amounts totaling million 
the company continued to exceed the above noted threshold in and increased the notional amount to million 
as of december   the company held interest rate swaps with notional amounts totaling million  a decrease of million due to agreements that expired during the year that were not renewed 
these agreements will expire throughout the purpose of these agreements is to hedge against changes in market interest rates to be charged on the company s borrowings under its credit facility 
the march credit facility amendment and restatement eliminated the requirement to maintain a certain threshold of fixed rate debt as a percentage of the company s total debt 
swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because the notional amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the result of the swap s notional amount and the fixed and floating rate percentages to be charged on the swap 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  interest rate differentials associated with the company s interest rate swaps are recorded as an adjustment to interest payable or receivable with the offset to interest expense over the life of the swap 
the swap agreements were a liability with a fair value of million recorded on the balance sheet as of december   and a million tax effected amount recorded in other comprehensive income 
potential nonperformance by counterparties to the swap agreements exposes the company to a certain amount of credit risk due to the possibility of counterparty default 
because the company s only counterparties in these transactions are financial institutions that are at least investment grade  it believes the risk of counterparty default is minimal 
interest rate risk management the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the following table sets forth the face amounts  maturity dates and average interest rates for the fixed and floating rate debt held by the company at december  excluding capital leases and interest rate swaps in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt floating rate debt average interest rate on floating rate debt
