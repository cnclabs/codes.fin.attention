in may  we acquired all of the outstanding securities of freshwater software  inc freshwater  a provider of ebusiness monitoring and management solutions 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  accordingly  the operating results of freshwater have been included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
if the purchase had occurred at the beginning of each period  net revenues would have been million in and million in  net income would have been million in both years  and earnings per share would have been in both years 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenue  certain consolidated statements of operations data for the periods indicated 
these operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
years ended december  revenues license fees subscription fees maintenance fees professional service fees total revenues costs and expenses cost of license and subscription cost of maintenance cost of professional services marketing and selling research and development general and administrative amortization of unearned stock based compensation restructuring  integration and other related charges amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets total costs and expenses income from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income our presentation changed starting in with the break out of license  subscription  maintenance and professional service fee revenue  and costs and expenses on the statements of operations 
in addition  we have reclassified prior year balances in order to conform to the current period presentation 
business model revenue consists of fees for license and subscription licenses of our software products  maintenance fees  and professional service fees 
license revenue is comprised of license fees charged for the use of our products licensed under perpetual or multiple year arrangements in which the fair value of the license fee is separately determinable from maintenance and or professional services 
subscription revenue represents license fees to use one or more software products  and to receive maintenance support such as hotline support and updates for a limited period of time 
since subscription licenses include bundled products and services  both product and service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license 
maintenance revenue is comprised of fees charged for post contract customer support which are determinable based upon vendor specific evidence of fair value 
professional service revenue is comprised of fees charged for product training and consulting services which are determinable based upon vendor specific evidence of fair value 
due to the different treatment of subscription and perpetual multiple licenses under applicable accounting rules  each type of license has a different impact on our financial statements 
when a customer buys a 
table of contents subscription license  the majority of the revenue will be recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet 
the amount recorded as deferred revenue is equal to the portion of the license fee that has been invoiced or paid but not recognized 
deferred revenue is reduced as revenue is recognized 
under perpetual licenses and some multi year arrangements for which separate vendor specific objective evidence exists for undelivered elements  a high proportion of all license revenue is recognized in the quarter that the product is delivered  with relatively little recorded as deferred revenue 
therefore  an order for a subscription license will result in significantly lower current period revenue than an equal sized order under the prior form of perpetual licenses 
conversely  an order for a subscription license will result in higher revenues recognized in future periods than an equal sized order for a perpetual or multi year license 
our license revenue in any given quarter is dependent upon the volume of perpetual orders shipped during the quarter and the amount of subscription revenue amortized from deferred revenue and  to a small degree  recognized on subscription orders received during the quarter 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain license mix of perpetual licenses and subscription licenses 
the precise mix of orders is subject to substantial fluctuation in any given quarter or multiple quarter periods  and the actual mix of licenses sold affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve the target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we deliver more than expected subscription licenses or may exceed them if we deliver more than expected perpetual licenses 
if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we may not meet our revenue targets 
in  we effected a change in the mix of software license types to a higher percentage of subscription licenses 
we believe that this shift may continue in the future  as more of our products are offered on a subscription basis 
this shift may decrease recognized revenue in the near term 
cost of license and subscription includes direct costs to produce and distribute our products  such as costs of materials  product packaging and shipping  equipment depreciation and production personnel  and costs associated with our managed services business  including personnel related costs  fees to providers of internet bandwidth and related infrastructure isp fees and depreciation expense of managed services equipment 
cost of maintenance includes direct costs of providing product customer support  largely consisting of personnel costs and related expenses  and the cost of providing upgrades to our subscription customers 
we have not broken out the costs associated with subscriptions because these costs can not be separated between license and subscription cost of revenue 
cost of professional services includes direct costs of providing product training and consulting  largely consisting of personnel costs and related expenses 
the cost associated with subscription licenses  which include the cost of products and services  are expensed as incurred over the subscription term 
in addition  we defer the portion of our commission expense related to subscription licenses and amortize the expense over the subscription term

amortization of unearned stock based compensation during the second quarter of  in connection with the acquisition of freshwater  we recorded unearned stock based compensation totaling million associated with approximately  unvested stock options that we assumed 
the options assumed were valued using the fair market value of our stock on the date of acquisition  which was 
we also recorded stock based compensation expense of  in conjunction with the third quarter restructuring

the charge included costs for consolidation of facilities  employee severance  and fixed asset write offs 
as of june   all costs associated with the charge had been paid 
during the third quarter of  in connection with management s plan to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies  we recorded restructuring charges of million  consisting of million for employee reductions  million for the cancellation of a marketing event  and  for professional services and consolidation of facilities 
employee reductions consisted of approximately employees  or of our worldwide workforce 
total cash outlays associated with the restructuring were originally expected to be million  of which million of cash was paid through december  during the first quarter of  we reversed  of the cash restructuring charges associated with the cancellation of the marketing event because we were able to use the deposit for another event

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  compared to million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  and was zero for the year ended december  in may  we acquired all of the outstanding securities of freshwater for cash consideration of million 
in connection with this acquisition  we assumed net assets of million and recorded a deferred tax liability of million 
the purchase price included  for the fair value of approximately  assumed freshwater vested stock options  as well as direct acquisition costs of  the fair value of options assumed was estimated using the black scholes model with the following assumptions fair value of  expected life years of four  risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and dividend yield of zero percent 
the allocation of the purchase price resulted in an excess of purchase price over net tangible assets acquired of million 
this was allocated  based on a third 
table of contents party valuation  million to workforce  million to purchased technology and million to goodwill 
during and  the goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in january  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill and reclassified million of workforce to goodwill 
we recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during we also wrote off a deferred tax liability of  associated with workforce against goodwill 
we were also required to perform a preliminary assessment of goodwill and an annual impairment review thereafter and potentially more frequently if circumstances change 
we completed the preliminary assessment during the first quarter of and performed an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter and did not record an impairment charge 
we will perform an annual impairment review during and every year thereafter 
the impairment review involved a two step process as follows step we compared the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeded the unit s fair value  we would have moved on to step since the unit s fair value exceeded the carrying value  no further work was performed and no impairment charge was necessary 
step if we had determined in step that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded our fair value  we would have performed an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to our identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this would have derived an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we would then have compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill was greater than the implied fair value of our goodwill  an impairment loss would have been recognized for the excess 
during the fourth quarter of  upon further review of sfas no 
 we reclassified million of net intangible assets to goodwill 
we had previously amortized goodwill of  associated with these intangible assets in each of the first three quarters of we did not amortize this amount during the fourth quarter of and have ceased amortization associated with these intangible assets 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge against goodwill for the estimated costs to sublease excess facilities in boulder  colorado in connection with the freshwater acquisition 
upon completion of the acquisition  we were able to accurately estimate the costs to sublease these facilities by reviewing vacancy rates and current market conditions 
this charge included million for the remaining lease commitments of these facilities  net of the estimated sublease income throughout the duration of the lease term  and  for the write down of related leasehold improvements 
during the fourth quarter of  we increased the idle facility charge against net income by  due to a change in estimate for the sublease start date 
during the year ended december   cash payments of  were made in connection with this charge 
at december   our idle facility accrual was  and is payable through should facilities rental rates continue to decrease in this market or should it take longer than expected to sublease these facilities  the actual loss could exceed these estimates 
other income  net other income  net consists primarily of interest income  interest expense related to our convertible subordinated notes notes  our interest rate swap  gains from the early retirement of this debt  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
other income  net was million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  compared to million for the year ended december   or of total revenue 
the absolute dollar decrease of million was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in interest income due to lower interest rates  a reduction of million on gains on early retirement of notes  a loss of 
table of contents million on three of our investments in early stage private companies  and an increase of million in foreign exchange losses 
these decreases in other income were offset by an million decrease in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the retirement of notes  an increase of million in net interest income associated with our interest rate swap  and a  unrealized gain on our interest rate swap 
other income  net was million for the year ended december   or of total revenue  compared to million for the year ended december   or of total revenue 
the absolute dollar increase of million was primarily attributable to a million gain on early retirement of notes and an increase of million in interest income due to higher average annual investment balances 
these increases in other income were offset by a million increase in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our notes and an increase of  in foreign exchange losses 
during the year ended december   we paid million including accrued interest of million to retire million face value of the notes  which resulted in a gain on early retirement of debt of million 
from december through june   we retired million face value of the notes 
no notes were retired during the last six months of as a result of the retirement  our interest expense resulting from our notes decreased during we comply with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the standard requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through the statement of operations 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
the accounting for gains or losses from changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship  as well as on the type of hedging relationship 
we have entered into forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated receivables due from certain emea  apac  and japan subsidiaries and foreign branches against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria used for designating a forward contract as a hedge considers its effectiveness in reducing risk by matching hedging instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the forward contracts in effect at december  mature at various dates through july and are hedges of certain foreign currency transaction exposures in the australian dollar  british pound  danish kroner  euro  japanese yen  norwegian kroner  and swedish kroner 
the unrealized net gain on our forward contracts at december  and was  and  respectively 
we utilize forward exchange contracts of one fiscal month duration to offset various non functional currency exposures 
currencies hedged under this program include the australian dollar  canadian dollar  english pound  euro  israel shekel  and swedish kroner 
increases or decreases in the value of these non functional currency assets are offset by gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risk associated with foreign exchange market fluctuations 
in january and february  we entered into two interest rate swaps with respect to million of our notes 
in november  we terminated our january and february interest rate swaps with goldman sachs capital markets  lp gscm and replaced them with a single interest rate swap with gscm in order to improve the overall effectiveness of our interest rate swap arrangement 
the november interest rate swap is 
table of contents designated as an effective hedge of the change in the fair value attributable to the london interbank offering rate the libor rate of million of our notes 
the objective of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate on the notes to a variable interest rate based on the month libor rate plus basis points 
beginning in january  the variable interest rate on the november interest rate swap was modified so that it is now based on the month libor plus basis points 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value attributable to changes in the libor rate throughout the life of the notes 
the interest rate swap creates a market exposure to changes in the libor rate 
if the libor rate increases or decreases by  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  quarterly on a pretax basis 
under the terms of the swap  we are required to provide initial collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents to gscm in the amount of million as continuing security for our obligations under the swap irrespective of movements in the value of the swap and from time to time additional collateral can change hands between mercury interactive and gscm as swap rates and equity prices fluctuate 
we accounted for the initial collateral and any additional collateral as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes  we will be required to pay the fixed rate of and receive a variable rate on the million principal amount of the notes 
if we call the notes at a premium in whole or in part  or if any of the holders of the notes elected to convert the notes in whole or in part  we will be required to pay a variable rate and receive the fixed rate of on the principal amount of such called or converted notes 
the january and february interest rate swaps had the same general economic parameters as the november interest rate swap described above 
our november interest rate swap qualifies under sfas no 
as a fair value hedge 
we record the fair value of our interest rate swap and the change in the fair value of the underlying notes attributable to changes in the libor rate on our balance sheets  and we record the ineffectiveness arising from the difference between the two fair values in our statements of operations as other income 
at december   the fair value of the january swap was approximately million  and the change in the fair value of our notes attributable to changes in the libor rate during the year resulted in an increase to the carrying value of our notes of million 
the difference of  was recorded in other income as the unrealized gain on interest rate swap for the year ended december  at december   our total restricted cash associated with the swap was million 
provision for income taxes historically  our operations resulted in a significant amount of income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investments 
the tax holidays and rate reductions  which we will be able to realize under programs currently in effect  expire at various dates through future provisions for taxes will depend upon the mix of worldwide income and the tax rates in effect for various tax jurisdictions 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and differ from statutory tax rates principally because of the non deductibility of charges for stock based compensation and our participation in special reduced taxation programs in israel 
we intend to continue to increase our investment in our israeli operations consistent with our overall tax strategy 
us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes were not provided for on undistributed earnings for certain non us subsidiaries 
we intend to invest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside the us 
in  we sold the economic rights of freshwater s intellectual property to our israeli subsidiary 
as a result of this intellectual property sale  we have recorded a current tax payable and a prepaid tax asset in the amount of million  which will be amortized to income tax expense over eight years  which approximates the period over which the expected benefit is expected to be realized 
at december   we have a prepaid tax asset of million included in prepaid expenses and million included in net other assets 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity consisted of million of cash and investments  compared to million at december  the december  balance included million of short term and million of long term investments in high quality financial  government  and corporate securities 
the increase in cash and investments from december   compared to december  was primarily due to positive cash generated from operations and cash received from issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans  offset by cash used to retire our notes  capital expenditures  and other investments 
during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from operating activities  compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in cash from operations during the twelve months of  compared to the twelve months of was due primarily to a larger increase in the deferred revenue balance 
during the year ended december   our investing activities consisted primarily of net maturities of investments of million and purchases of property and equipment of million 
our purchases of property and equipment included million for the construction of research and development facilities in israel 
we completed construction of the israel facility and moved in during the third quarter of in addition  we have two buildings in sunnyvale that we purchased and that we have not yet renovated 
we expect to spend approximately million on renovations of these buildings in sunnyvale 
our investing activities also consisted of capital call payments in a private equity fund and an early stage private company of million 
we have committed to make additional capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million and we expect to pay approximately million through march  as capital calls are made 
our investing activities also consisted of delivery of restricted cash as collateral required under our interest rate swap with gscm of million 
during the year ended december   our primary financing activity consisted primarily of the retirement of notes of million excluding interest expense  offset by cash proceeds from common stock issued under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans  net of notes receivable collected from issuance of common stock of million 
in july  we raised million from the issuance of notes with an aggregate principal amount of million 
the notes mature on july  and bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semiannually on january and july of each year 
the notes are subordinated in right of payment to all of our future senior debt 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity at a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
we may redeem our notes  in whole or in part  at any time on or after july  accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in each redemption 
during the year ended december   we paid million including accrued interest of million to retire million face value of the notes  which resulted in a gain on early retirement of debt of million 
from december through june   we retired million face value of the notes 
no notes were retired during the last six months of as a result of the retirement  our interest expense resulting from our notes decreased during during the year ended december   a significant portion of our cash inflows was generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly  as a result of decreases in customer demand or decreases in the acceptance of our future products and services  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 

table of contents future payments due under debt and lease obligations at december  are as follows in thousands convertible subordinated notes due a non cancelable operating leases total thereafter total a assuming we do not retire additional notes during and interest rates stay consistent  we will make interest payments net of our interest rate swap of approximately million during    and  and approximately million during the face value of our notes differs from our book value 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of our long term debt activities and related accounting policies 
during we effected a change in the mix of software license types to a higher percentage of subscription licenses 
this shift does not impact our collections cycle as cash is generally received within days from the invoice date  depending upon the region 
our quarterly operating results are affected by the mix of license types entered into in connection with the sale of products 
as revenue associated with our subscription licenses is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license  the shift in mix will also result in deferred revenue becoming a larger component of our cash provided by operations 
we believe that the shift to a subscription revenue model will continue in the future  as more of our products are offered on a subscription basis 
in the future  we expect cash will continue to be generated from our operations 
we do not expect to spend significant amounts of additional cash to acquire property and equipment in the near term and therefore the level of cash used in investing activities to acquire property and equipment should remain constant with that used in we do  however  currently plan to reinvest our cash generated from operations in new short and long term investments in high quality financial  government and corporate securities or other investments  consistent with past investment practices  and therefore net cash used in investing activities may increase 
cash could be used in the future to invest in acquisitions  strategic investments  or repurchase additional debt or equity 
assuming there is no significant change in our business  we believe that our current cash and investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  
table of contents valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets  accounting for income taxes  accounting for non consolidated companies  and accounting for unearned stock based compensation 
we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other key accounting policies 
we believe that these other policies either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have made significant judgments related to revenue recognition  specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our arrangements  we must evaluate whether our fee is fixed or determinable and we must assess whether collectibility is probable 
these judgments are discussed below 
the fee is fixed or determinable with respect to each arrangement  we must make a judgment as to whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
if the fee is fixed or determinable  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of software assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  then the revenue recognized in each quarter subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria will be the lesser of the aggregate of amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees had been fixed or determinable 
a determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable also depends upon the payment terms relating to such an arrangement 
our customary payment terms are generally within days of the invoice date  depending upon the region 
arrangements with payment terms extending beyond the customary payment terms are considered not to be fixed or determinable 
a determination of whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable is particularly relevant to revenue recognition on perpetual licenses 
collectibility is probable in order to recognize revenue  we must make a judgment of the collectibility of the arrangement fee 
our judgment of the collectibility is applied on a customer by customer basis 
we generally sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable the customer does not have a successful collection history with us  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported period 
use of estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  the sales reserve and prepaid commissions 
we must make estimates of potential future product returns and write offs of bad debt accounts related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  historical bad debts  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales reserves 
as a percentage of current period revenue  changes against sales reserves was insignificant in both the years 
table of contents ended december  and significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales reserve in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
at december  and  the provision for sales reserves was million and million  respectively 
we are required to make estimates of the future sales commission expense associated with our revenue that will be recognized in future periods 
we analyze historical commission rates  composition of the future revenue and expected timing of revenue recognition of such future amounts 
we make significant judgments and estimates in connection with establishing the prepaid commission in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our sales commission expense for any period if we make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
at december  and  prepaid commission was million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived and other intangible assets and goodwill our property  plant and equipment and intangible assets policies are detailed in note and goodwill and intangible assets accounting is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are required to assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill on an annual basis  and potentially more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
we completed the preliminary assessment during the first quarter of and performed an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter and did not record an impairment charge 
during the fourth quarter of  upon further review of sfas no 
 we reclassified million of net intangible assets to goodwill 
we had previously amortized goodwill of  associated with these intangible assets in each of the first three quarters of we did not amortize this amount during the fourth quarter of and have ceased amortization associated with these intangible assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure this impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow 
net intangible assets and long lived assets was million and million at december  and  respectively 
goodwill was and million at december  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is 
table of contents not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in addition  to the extent that we are unable to continue to reinvest a substantial portion of our profits in our israeli operations  we may be subject to additional tax rate increases in the future 
our taxes could increase if these tax rate incentives are not renewed upon expiration  tax rates applicable to us are increased  authorities challenge our tax strategy  or are impacted by new laws or rulings 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the entire portion of the net operating losses related to the income tax benefits arising from the exercise of employees stock options that will be credited directly to stockholders equity in the future 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
accounting for non consolidated companies from time to time  we make venture capital investments in early stage private companies and private equity funds for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are accounted for under the cost method  as we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over these companies operations 
we periodically monitor our investments for impairment and will record reductions in carrying values if and when necessary 
the evaluation process is based on information that we request from these privately held companies 
this information is not subject to the same disclosure regulations as us public companies  and as such  the basis for these evaluations is subject to the timing and the accuracy of the data received from these companies 
as part of this evaluation process  our review includes  but is not limited to  a review of each company s cash position  recent financing activities  financing needs  earnings revenue outlook  operational performance  management ownership changes  and competition 
if we determine that the carrying value of a company is at an amount below fair value  or if a company has completed a financing based on a valuation significantly lower than our initial investment  it is our policy to record a reserve and the related write down is recorded as an investment loss on our consolidated statements of operations 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective and may contribute to significant volatility in our reported results of operations 
at december   we had invested million in private companies 
in addition  we have committed to make capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million and we expect to pay approximately million through march  as capital calls are made 
if the companies in which we have made investments do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies or for cash  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recover our investment 
the prolonged general decline in the nasdaq national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any additional declines in the future  will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on many of these investments 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss in other income  net  of million on three of our investments in early stage private companies 
accounting for unearned stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
unearned stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as some options granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options  which is generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per share is required by sfas no 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for employee stock options and stock purchase plans under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 to stock based employee compensation 
year ended december  net income  as reported add unearned stock based compensation expense included in reported net income deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income loss net income per share basic  as reported net income loss per share basic  pro forma net income per share diluted  as reported net income loss per share diluted  pro forma the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to the option plans and the employee stock purchase plan espp at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income and earnings per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share in the future years for the following reasons the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly

risk factors in addition to the other information included in this annual report on form k  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business and us 
our future success depends on our ability to respond to rapid market and technological changes by introducing new products and services and continually improving the performance  features and reliability of our existing products and services and responding to competitive offerings 
our business will suffer if we do not successfully respond to rapid technological changes 
the market for our software products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent introduction of new products and services and enhancements to existing products and services by our competitors  increasing complexity and interdependence of our applications  changes in industry standards and practices  and changes in customer requirements and demands 
to maintain our competitive position  we must continue to enhance our existing software testing  deployment assurance and apm products and services and to develop new products and services  functionality and technology that address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers 
the development of new products and services  and enhancement of existing products and services  entail significant technical and business risks and require substantial lead time and significant investments in product development 
if we fail to anticipate new technology developments  customer requirements or industry standards  or if we are unable to develop new products and services that adequately address these new developments  requirements and standards in a timely manner  our products and services may become obsolete  our ability to compete may be impaired and our revenue could decline 
we expect our quarterly revenue and operating results to fluctuate  and it is difficult to predict our future revenue and operating results 
our revenue and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter in the future 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control  including fluctuations in demand for and sales of our products and services  our success in developing and introducing new products and services and the timing of new product and service introductions  our ability to introduce enhancements to our existing products and services in a timely manner  
table of contents changes in economic conditions affecting our customers or our industry  changes in the mix of products or services sold in a quarter  changes in the mix of perpetual  term or subscription licenses sold in a quarter  fluctuations in the number of large orders in a quarter  the introduction of new or enhanced products and services by our competitors and changes in the pricing policies of these competitors  the discretionary nature of our customers purchase and budget cycles and changes in their budgets for software and related purchases  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our business  deferrals by our customers of orders in anticipation of new products or services or product enhancements  and the mix of our domestic and international sales  together with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our license revenue in any given quarter is dependent upon the volume of perpetual orders shipped during the quarter and the amount of subscription revenue amortized from deferred revenue and  to a small degree  recognized on subscription orders received during the quarter 
we set our revenue targets for any given period based  in part  upon an assumption that we will achieve a certain level of orders and a certain license mix of perpetual licenses and subscription licenses 
the precise mix of orders is subject to substantial fluctuation in any given quarter or multiple quarter periods  and the actual mix of licenses sold affects the revenue we recognize in the period 
if we achieve the target level of total orders but are unable to achieve our target license mix  we may not meet our revenue targets if we deliver more than expected subscription licenses or may exceed them if we deliver more than expected perpetual licenses 
if we achieve the target license mix but the overall level of orders is below the target level  then we will not meet our revenue targets 
in  we saw a change in the mix of software license types to a higher percentage of subscription licenses 
we believe that this shift will continue in the future  as more of our products are offered on a subscription basis 
this shift may decrease recognized revenue in the near term 
in addition  the timing of our license revenue is difficult to predict because our sales cycles are typically short and can vary substantially from product to product and customer to customer 
we base our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
because of the timing of larger orders and customer buying patterns  we may not learn of shortfalls in revenue or earnings or other failures to meet market expectations until late in a particular quarter 
as a result  if total revenue for a particular quarter is below our expectations  we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter 
we have experienced seasonality in our revenue and earnings  with the fourth quarter of the year typically having the highest revenue and earnings for the year and higher revenue and earnings than the first quarter of the following year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from the budgeting cycles of our customers and  to a lesser extent  from the structure of our sales commission program 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
our customers decisions to purchase our products and services are discretionary and subject to their internal budgets and purchasing processes 
we believe that the ongoing slowdown in the economy  the current international political uncertainties  and uncertainties in the capital markets have caused and may continue to cause customers to reassess their immediate technology needs  to lengthen their purchasing decision making processes  to require more senior level internal approvals of purchases and to defer purchasing decisions  and accordingly  has reduced and could reduce demand in the future for our products and services 

table of contents due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
if our operating results are below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the trading prices of our securities could decline 
we expect to face increasing competition in the future  which could cause reduced sales levels and result in price reductions  reduced gross margins or loss of market share 
the market for our testing  deployment assurance  and apm products and services is extremely competitive  dynamic and subject to frequent technological change 
there are few substantial barriers of entry in our market 
the internet has further reduced these barriers of entry  allowing other companies to compete with us in the testing  deployment assurance  and apm markets 
as a result of the increased competition  our success will depend  in large part  on our ability to identify and respond to the needs of potential customers  and to new technological and market opportunities  before our competitors identify and respond to these needs and opportunities 
we may fail to respond quickly enough to these needs and opportunities 
in the market for testing solutions  our principal competitors include compuware  empirix  rational software acquired by ibm software group  and segue software 
in the new and rapidly changing market for apm solutions  our principal competitors include established providers of systems and network management software such as bmc software  computer associates  hp openview and tivoli  a division of ibm  and providers of hosted services such as keynote systems  and emerging companies 
additionally  we face potential competition in this market from existing providers of testing solutions such as segue software and compuware 
we believe that the principal competitive factors affecting our market are price and cost effectiveness  product functionality  product performance  including scalability and reliability  quality of support and service  and company reputation 
although we believe that our products and services currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  the market for apm and deployment assurance are new and rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position  and competitive pressure could seriously harm our business 
the software industry is increasingly experiencing consolidation and this could increase the resources available to our competitors and the scope of their product offerings 
for example  our testing competitor rational software was recently acquired by ibm software group 
our competitors and potential competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies or make more attractive offers to distribution partners and to employees 
if we fail to maintain our existing distribution channels and develop additional channels in the future  our revenue could decline 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products and services through distribution channels such as systems integrators or value added resellers 
we expect that sales of our products through these channels will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
we may not experience increased revenue from new channels and may see a decrease from our existing channels  which could harm our business 
the loss of one or more of our systems integrators or value added resellers  or any reduction or delay in their sales of our products and services could result in reductions in our revenue in future periods 
we have recently signed an agreement with sap ag that allows it to resell our line of products for use with sap systems  directly and through its subsidiaries and distributors 
in addition  our ability to increase our revenue in the future depends on our ability to expand our indirect distribution channels 

table of contents our dependence on indirect distribution channels presents a number of risks  including each of our systems integrators or value added resellers can cease marketing our products and services with limited or no notice and with little or no penalty  our existing systems integrators or value added resellers may not be able to effectively sell any new products and services that we may introduce  we may not be able to replace existing or recruit additional systems integrators or value added resellers  if we lose any of our existing ones  our systems integrators or value added resellers may also offer competitive products and services  we may face conflicts between the activities of our indirect channels and our direct sales and marketing activities  and our systems integrators or value added resellers may not give priority to the marketing of our products and services as compared to our competitors products 
we depend on strategic relationships and business alliances for continued growth of our business 
our development  marketing and distribution strategies rely increasingly on our ability to form strategic relationships with software and other technology companies 
these business relationships often consist of cooperative marketing programs  joint customer seminars  lead referrals and cooperation in product development 
many of these relationships are not contractual and depend on the continued voluntary cooperation of each party with us 
divergence in strategy or change in focus by  or competitive product offerings by  any of these companies may interfere with our ability to develop  market  sell or support our products  which in turn could harm our business 
further  if these companies enter into strategic alliances with other companies or are acquired  they could reduce their support of our products 
our existing relationships may be jeopardized if we enter into alliances with competitors of our strategic partners 
in addition  one or more of these companies may use the information they gain from their relationship with us to develop or market competing products 
our customers and partners may not accept our new bto strategy 
we increasingly focus our efforts on sales of enterprise wide solutions  which consist of our entire optane product suite and related professional services  and managed services  rather than on the sale of component products 
as a result  each sale requires substantial time and effort from our sales and support staff as well as involvement by our professional services and managed services organizations and our systems integrator partners 
large individual sales  or even small delays in customer orders  can cause significant variation in our revenues and results of operations for a particular period 
the timing of large orders is usually difficult to predict and  like many software and services companies  many of our customers typically complete transactions in the last month of a quarter 
if we are unable to manage rapid changes in our business  our business may be harmed 
we have  in the past  experienced significant growth in revenue  employees and number of product and service offerings and we believe this growth will be renewed 
this growth has placed a significant strain on our management and our financial  operational  marketing and sales systems 
we are implementing a variety of new or expanded business and financial systems  procedures and controls  including the improvement of our sales and customer support systems 
the implementation of these systems  procedures and controls may not be completed successfully  or may disrupt our operations 
any failure by us to properly manage these transitions could impair our ability to attract and service customers and could cause us to incur higher operating costs and experience delays in the execution of our business plan 
we have also in the past experienced reductions in revenue and that has required us to rapidly reduce costs 
if we fail to reduce staffing levels when necessary  our costs would be excessive and our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
the success of our business depends on the efforts and abilities of our senior management and other key personnel 
we depend on the continued services and performance of our senior management and other key personnel 
we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
the loss of any of 
table of contents our executive officers or other key employees could hurt our business 
the loss of senior personnel can result in significant disruption to our ongoing operations  and new senior personnel must spend a significant amount of time learning our business and our systems in addition to performing their regular duties 
we depend on our international operations for a substantial portion of our revenue 
sales to customers located outside the us have historically accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue and we anticipate that such sales will continue to be a significant percentage of our revenue 
as a percentage of our total revenue  sales to customers outside the us were  and in  and  respectively 
we face risks associated with our international operations  including changes in tax laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  the need to localize products for sale in international markets  longer payment cycles to collect accounts receivable in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity in other parts of the world in which we operate  political and economic instability  and economic downturns in international markets 
any of these risks could harm our international operations and cause lower international sales 
for example  some emea countries already have laws and regulations related to technologies used on the internet that are more strict than those currently in force in the us 
any or all of these factors could cause our business to be harmed 
because our research and development operations are primarily located in israel  we may be affected by volatile political  economic  and military conditions in that country and by restrictions imposed by that country on the transfer of technology 
our operations depend on the availability of highly skilled scientific and technical personnel in israel 
our business also depends on trading relationships between israel and other countries 
in addition to the risks associated with international sales and operations generally  our operations could be adversely affected if major hostilities involving israel should occur or if trade between israel and its current trading partners were interrupted or curtailed 
these risks are compounded due to the restrictions on our ability to manufacture or transfer outside of israel any technology developed under research and development grants from the government of israel  without the prior written consent of the government of israel 
if we are unable to obtain the consent of the government of israel  we may not be able to take advantage of strategic manufacturing and other opportunities outside of israel 
we are subject to the risk of increased taxes 
historically  our operations resulted in a significant amount of income in israel where tax rate incentives have been extended to encourage foreign investment 
our taxes could increase if these tax rate incentives are not renewed upon expiration or tax rates applicable to us are increased 
tax authorities could challenge the manner in which profits are allocated among us and our subsidiaries  and we may not prevail in any such challenge 
if the profits recognized by our subsidiaries in jurisdictions where taxes are lower became subject to income taxes in other jurisdictions  our worldwide effective tax rate would increase 
in addition  to the extent that we are unable to continue to reinvest a substantial portion of our profits in our israeli operations  we may be subject to additional tax rate increases in the future 
other factors that could increase our effective tax rate include the effect of changing economic conditions  business opportunities  and changes in tax laws and rulings 
we have in the past and may continue in the future to retire amounts outstanding under our notes 
to the extent that these repurchases are completed below the par 
table of contents value of the outstanding notes  we may generate a taxable gain from these repurchases 
these gains may result in an increase in our effective tax rate 
merger and acquisition activities  if any  could result in nondeductible expenses which may increase our effective tax rate 
our worldwide effective tax rate could be increased to the extent we are impacted by new tax laws or rulings 
our financial results may be negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
our foreign operations are generally transacted through our international sales subsidiaries 
as a result  these sales and related expenses are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
because our financial results are reported in us dollars  our results of operations may be harmed by fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies  including a decrease in the value of emea or apac currencies relative to the us dollar  which would decrease our reported us dollar revenue  as we generate revenue in these local currencies and report the related revenue in us dollars  and an increase in the value of emea  apac  or israeli currencies relative to the us dollar  which would increase our sales and marketing costs in these countries and would increase research and development costs in israel 
we attempt to limit foreign exchange exposure through operational strategies and by using forward contracts to offset the effects of exchange rate changes on intercompany trade balances 
this requires us to estimate the volume of transactions in various currencies 
we may not be successful in making these estimates 
if these estimates are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience material currency gains or losses 
acquisitions may be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value or divert the attention of our management and investments may become impaired and require us to take a charge against earnings 
in may  we acquired freshwater and we have minority investments in private companies and private equity funds of million at december  and we may acquire or make investments in other companies and technologies 
for the year ended december   we had recorded a loss in other income  net  of million on three of our investments in early stage private companies 
in addition  we have committed to make capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million and we expect to pay approximately million through march  as capital calls are made 
we are closely monitoring the financial health of the other private companies in which we hold minority equity investments 
if we determine in accordance with our standard accounting policies that an impairment has occurred  then additional losses would be recorded 
in the event of any future acquisitions or investments  we could issue stock that would dilute the ownership of our then existing stockholders  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur charges for the impairment of the value of investments or acquired assets  or incur amortization expense related to intangible assets 
if we fail to achieve the financial and strategic benefits of past and future acquisitions or investments  our operating results will suffer 
acquisitions and investments involve numerous other risks  including difficulties integrating the acquired operations  technologies or products with ours  failure to achieve targeted synergies  unanticipated costs and liabilities  diversion of management s attention from our core business  
table of contents adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers or those of the acquired organization  difficulties entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organizations 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may result in losses for investors and possible lawsuits 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
for example  during the week period ended february   the closing prices of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market ranged from a high of to a low of 
we expect our stock price to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic relationships  acquisitions or investments  changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts  changes in general economic conditions  terrorist attacks  and the effects of war  conditions or trends affecting the software industry and the internet  and changes in the economic performance and or market valuations of other software and high technology companies 
because of this volatility  we may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future  and the trading prices of our securities could decline as a result 
in addition  the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the trading prices of equity securities of many high technology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
any negative change in the public s perception of software or internet software companies could depress our stock price regardless of our operating results 
if we fail to adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  we may lose a valuable asset  experience reduced revenue and incur costly litigation to protect our rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  service marks and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our products and services 
we will not be able to protect our intellectual property if we are unable to enforce our rights or if we do not detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products and services and use information that we regard as proprietary to create products and services that compete with ours 
some license provisions protecting against unauthorized use  copying  transfer and disclosure of our licensed programs may be unenforceable under the laws of certain jurisdictions and foreign countries 
further  the laws of some countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us 
to the extent that we increase our international activities  our exposure to unauthorized copying and use of our products and proprietary information will increase 
in many cases  we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants and with the customers and corporations with whom we have strategic relationships and business alliances 
no assurance can be given that these agreements will be effective in controlling access to and distribution of our products and proprietary information 
further  these agreements do not prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our products 

table of contents litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to protect our trade secrets 
litigation  whether successful or unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversions of our management resources  either of which could seriously harm our business 
third parties could assert that our products and services infringe their intellectual property rights  which could expose us to litigation that  with or without merit  could be costly to defend 
we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our customers against these claims 
parties making these claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to sell our products in the us and abroad and could result in an award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a claim of infringement  we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties  develop alternative technology or to alter our products or processes or cease activities that infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties 
if we are required to obtain licenses  we cannot be sure that we will be able to do so at a commercially reasonable cost  or at all 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain required licenses could delay shipment of our products and increase our costs 
in addition  any such lawsuit could result in our incurring significant costs or the diversion of the attention of our management 
future product development is dependent upon early access to third party software 
software developers have  in the past  provided us with early access to pre generally available ga versions of their software in order to have input into the functionality and to ensure that we can adapt our software to exploit new functionality in these systems 
some companies  however  may adopt more restrictive policies in the future or impose unfavorable terms and conditions for such access 
these restrictions may result in high research and development costs for us in connection with the enhancement and modification of our existing products and the development of new products or may prevent us from being able to develop products which will work with such new systems which could harm our business 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company  including an acquisition that would be beneficial to our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
furthermore  our preferred share purchase rights agreement  as amended  and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and of delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in our control or management  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
in july  we completed an offering of notes with a principal amount of million 
from december through june   we retired million face value of the notes 
we continue to have a substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness  primarily the notes 
there is the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
our leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  and limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete 

table of contents in january and february  we entered into two interest rate swaps with respect to million of our notes 
in november  we terminated our january and february interest rate swaps with gscm and replaced them with a single interest rate swap with gscm in order to improve the overall effectiveness of our interest rate swap arrangement 
the november interest rate swap is designated as an effective hedge of the change in the fair value attributable to the libor rate of million of our notes 
the objective of the swap is to convert the fixed interest rate on the notes to a variable interest rate based on the month libor rate plus basis points 
beginning in january  the variable interest rate on the november interest rate swap was modified so that it is now based on the month libor plus basis points 
the gain or loss from changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is expected to be highly effective at offsetting the gain or loss from changes in the fair value attributable to changes in the libor rate throughout the life of the notes 
the interest rate swap creates a market exposure to changes in the libor rate 
if the libor rate increases or decreases by  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  quarterly on a pretax basis 
under the terms of the swap  we are required to provide initial collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents to gscm in the amount of million as continuing security for our obligations under the swap irrespective of movements in the value of the swap and from time to time additional collateral can change hands between mercury interactive and gscm as swap rates and equity prices fluctuate 
we accounted for the initial collateral and any additional collateral as restricted cash on our balance sheet 
if the price of our common stock exceeds the original conversion or redemption price of the notes  we will be required to pay the fixed rate of and receive a variable rate on the million principal amount of the notes 
if we call the notes at a premium in whole or in part  or if any of the holders of the notes elected to convert the notes in whole or in part  we will be required to pay a variable rate and receive the fixed rate of on the principal amount of such called or converted notes 
the january and february interest rate swaps had the same general economic parameters as the november interest rate swap described above 
our november interest rate swap qualifies under sfas no 
as a fair value hedge 
we record the fair value of our interest rate swap and the change in the fair value of the underlying notes attributable to changes in the libor rate on our balance sheets  and we record the ineffectiveness arising from the difference between the two fair values in our statements of operations as other income 
at december   the fair value of the january swap was approximately million  and the change in the fair value of our notes attributable to changes in the libor rate during the year resulted in an increase to the carrying value of our notes of million 
the difference of  was recorded in other income as the unrealized gain on interest rate swap for the year ended december  at december   our total restricted cash associated with the swap was million 
we are exposed to credit exposure with respect to gscm as counterparty under the swap 
however  we believe that the risk of such credit exposure is limited because gscm is an affiliate of a major us investment bank and because of its obligations under the swap is guaranteed by the goldman sachs group lp

we are exposed to credit exposure with respect to gscm as counterparty under the swap 
however  we believe that the risk of such credit exposure is limited because gscm is an affiliate of a major us investment bank and because of its obligations under the swap is guaranteed by the goldman sachs group lp we have entered into forward contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated receivables due from certain emea  apac  and japan subsidiaries and foreign branches against fluctuations in exchange rates 
we have not entered into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
our accounting policies for these contracts are based on our designation of the contracts as hedging transactions 
the criteria used for designating a forward contract as a hedge considers its effectiveness in reducing risk by matching hedging instruments to underlying transactions 
gains and losses on forward contracts are recognized in other income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our operating results or cash flows 
we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
the forward contracts in effect at december  mature at various dates through july and are hedges of certain foreign currency transaction exposures in the australian dollar  british pound  danish kroner  euro  japanese yen  norwegian kroner  and swedish kroner 
the unrealized net gain on our forward contracts at december  and was  and  respectively 
we utilize forward exchange contracts of one fiscal month duration to offset various non functional currency exposures 
currencies hedged under this program include the australian dollar  canadian dollar  english pound  euro  israel shekel  and swedish kroner 
increases or decreases in the value of these non functional currency assets are offset by gains and losses on the forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risk associated with foreign exchange market fluctuations 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
our operating expenses in each of these countries are in the local currencies  which mitigates a significant portion of the exposure related to local currency revenue 
from time to time  we make venture capital investments in early stage private companies and private equity funds for business and strategic purposes 
at december   we had invested million in private companies 
in addition  we have committed to make capital contributions to a private equity fund totaling million and we expect to pay approximately million through march  as capital calls are made 
if the companies in which we have made investments do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies or for cash  we may not be able to sell these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments we cannot assure that we will be able to sell them at a gain or even recover our investment 
the prolonged general decline in the nasdaq national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any additional declines in the future  will adversely affect our ability to realize gains or a return of our capital on many of these investments 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss in other income  net  of million on three of our investments in early stage private companies
