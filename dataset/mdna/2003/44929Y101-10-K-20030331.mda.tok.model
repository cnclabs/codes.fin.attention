item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported 
table of contents results could be materially affected 
however  the company is not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
the company s senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with its audit committee 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue as services are performed  generally based on hours of work incurred 
amounts collected from customers prior to the performance of services are recorded as deferred revenue 
deferred revenue totaled approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  which are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
management believes that its revenue recognition policies are in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf finalized its consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf issue is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this consensus on the company s consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
other items considered in estimating our allowance for uncollectible accounts include the balance of our over day receivables  the financial status of our customers and general economic conditions 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts if our future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as certain of our customers provide a high percent of total revenue and corresponding receivables 
accounts receivable as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
given the significance of accounts receivable to the company s consolidated financial statements  the determination of net realizable values is considered to be a critical accounting estimate 
long lived assets the company continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate that the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the long lived assets to measure recoverability 
if impairment is indicated  measurement of the impairment will be based on the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets  generally determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
impairment charges totaling approximately  were recognized as part of the million restructuring charges recorded in the year ended december  net property and equipment as of december  and totaled million and million  respectively  representing approximately and of total assets  respectively 
additionally  goodwill and other intangible assets represented of total assets as of december  and less than of total assets as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation of property and equipment  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
the company has recorded no valuation reserves for deferred tax assets as of december  although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income are reduced 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates and assesses the realizability of deferred tax assets and adjusts valuation allowances if required 
restructuring charges the company recorded a restructuring charge in december totaling million pretax 
this charge consisted of severance  site closure costs and asset impairments 
a liability for million is included in our consolidated balance sheet for the amount estimated to be payable to terminate the leases and close the identified facilities 
certain estimates were made in determining the amount of the charge for site closure costs and asset impairments 
given current market conditions and the inability to find suitable tenants  the company has assumed that no sublease income will be available to offset future rent payments due 
the amount of the charge could change over time if a suitable tenant is identified 
on a quarterly basis  management will be evaluating and assessing the appropriateness of the accrual and will be adjusting it as necessary 
accounting for contingencies 
table of contents in the ordinary course of business  the company has entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  the company could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships  or from its relationships with its employees 
the company accounts for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires the company to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of the company s financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
sfas no 
further states that when there is a range of loss and no amount within that range is a better estimate than any other  that the minimum amount in the range shall be accrued 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires company management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  the company s accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in the company s results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in the company s financial statements could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
as of december   accruals for loss contingencies  excluding estimated legal fees to defend the company against currently pending matters  totaled million and are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet

revenue increased to million from million in  driven by a increase in our billable hours  partially offset by a slight decrease in our hourly billing rate

the increase in wage rates is generally attributable to a shift in the company s business mix to include a greater proportion of crm services revenue  which typically have a higher labor rate per hour  combined with additional training costs incurred to support new and expanded client programs 
as additional nearshore and offshore facilities are opened  management expects wage rates to decline

charges recorded in included million for a claim from a current client in connection with services rendered in  million for litigation and million for offering costs that were expensed in the current year 
these types of charges were not present in as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were in both and the charges recorded in the fourth quarter mentioned above were offset by the company s ability to leverage its existing infrastructure to support volume growth

in the past  demand for the company s services typically slowed or decreased in the third quarter as the volume of business decreased during the summer months 
in addition  the company s operating expenses typically increased during the third quarter in anticipation of higher demand for its services during the fourth quarter 
however  more recently  the company has experienced quarterly fluctuations in its business as a result of other factors  such as the timing of the demand for the particular services the company offers in the specific geographic areas the company services  as well as the increasing portion of the company s business coming from crm services which generally have less seasonality than crm sales programs

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosure about market risk 
table of contents the company s operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its variable rate line of credit 
a change in market interest rates exposes the company to the risk of earnings or cash flow loss but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instrument 
borrowings under the company s line of credit are subject to variable libor or prime base rate pricing 
accordingly  a change in the libor rate and the prime rate would have resulted in interest expense changing by approximately  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the rate on million of outstanding borrowings at december  approximated market rates  thus  the fair value of the debt approximates its reported value 
in the past the company has not entered into financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or interest rate lock agreements 
however  it may consider these instruments to manage the impact of changes in interest rates based on management s assessment of future interest rates  volatility of the yield curve and the company s ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner 
foreign currency risk the company historically has not used foreign currency exchange contracts or purchased currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
the company has operations in canada  ireland  the united kingdom  australia  barbados and mexico that are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of income statements of these operations from local currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
the company s foreign operations represented of the company s consolidated revenue for the year ended december  in addition  foreign operations produced of the business associated with domestic revenue 
management does not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material
