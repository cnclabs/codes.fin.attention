our business strategies our key business strategy is to develop high quality gaming properties that offer a diverse range of lodging  dining and entertainment options to create a complete entertainment experience for our guests 
the quality of our properties derives from a variety of factors  including their design  size  location  gaming technology and amenities 
we also emphasize courteous and efficient service that meets or exceeds the expectations of our guests 
we believe that the continued pursuit of these strategies will generate attractive returns on our invested capital 
some of the key components of our operating strategies to be implemented in include the following leading slot technology we are an industry leader with respect to the implementation of cashless slot technology at our properties 
as of march   approximately of our slot machines provided cashless payouts utilizing ticket in ticket out technology 
we were the first operator to introduce this technology in missouri and iowa 
as of march   the slot machines at the st 
charles  kansas city  council bluffs  vicksburg and jackpot properties were    and ticket capable  respectively 
based on comments made by a gaming equipment manufacturer in the february issue of casino journal  we believe that only 
table of contents approximately of the slot machines in north america have ticketing capabilities 
our goal is to have approximately two thirds of our slot machines operating with ticketing capabilities by the end of  subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals by one of our equipment vendors 
we are continuing to upgrade our slot machines and slot systems to facilitate the timely rollout of cashless technology in order to maintain and enhance our competitive position 
we are also an industry leader with respect to the use of new generation multi coin nickel and penny denomination slot machines 
the implementation of these machines has generated a strong return on investment and has proven to be an extremely successful strategy 
in addition  we are currently implementing an aggressive strategy to increase our higher denomination play 
we continuously evaluate the appropriate mix of our slot product and invest in new slot products as appropriate to promote customer satisfaction and loyalty and generate maximum profitability 
profitable use of promotional allowances we have consistently pursued a strategy of marketing and promoting our properties  including the targeted use of cash coupon offerings  in order to attract and retain valued customers 
we believe our promotional allowances as a percentage of gross revenues on a consolidated basis are consistent with or lower than those of our principal competitors 
we adjust the amount of our promotional offerings from time to time based on competitive conditions  such as during periods of construction disruption similar to that currently affecting ameristar kansas city and in order to promote our new and expanded facilities and develop long term customer loyalty 
this strategy proved successful during and following completion of the expansion projects at vicksburg and council bluffs  as evidenced by the substantial improvement in operating performance at those properties from to our strategy has also begun to produce profitable growth at ameristar st 
charles as reflected by its assumption of the st 
louis market share lead following the opening of the new facility in august and steadily improving operating results since the opening of the property 
in february  ameristar st 
charles led this five property market with a market share  approximately three percentage points ahead of its principal competitor 
this competitor has an advantage over us since we do not currently have a hotel at the property and the competitor has hotel rooms 
we believe similar positive results will be achieved at the kansas city property following the completion of the renovation of that property later in providing the total entertainment experience in addition to providing the latest gaming technology for an exciting casino experience  our properties offer a wide variety of quality restaurants and entertainment options as an integral part of our casino marketing strategy 
some examples of our non gaming amenities that have our competitors operate properties in various markets other than those in which we operate  some of which have different competitive conditions that affect the level of promotional spending 
in addition  there may be differences  even under generally accepted accounting principles  in the items that are included in promotional allowances by different companies 

table of contents proven successful are our high tech amerisports bars council bluffs and st 
charles  our signature steakhouses company wide and our unique bottleneck blues bars vicksburg and st 
charles 
in addition  we regularly present nationally known entertainers to perform at our properties  including  for example  randy travis  michael bolton  paul anka  dionne warwick  julio iglesias  bob newhart and pat benatar 
future expansion we seek to expand our operations through a variety of means  including entering new north american markets created by the legalization of casino gaming  developing new casinos or buying existing casinos in established north american casino gaming markets and expanding through continued growth at our existing properties 
although our preference is to own and operate each of our gaming properties  we also consider expansion opportunities involving management contracts or joint ventures 
we continually evaluate the operating performance of each of our existing properties and the feasibility of enhancing their performance through capital expenditure programs 
in doing so  we assess the anticipated relative costs and benefits of the projects under consideration  the availability of cash flows and debt financing to fund capital expenditures and competitive and other relevant factors 
currently  the only substantial expansion project under way is the renovation and enhancement project at ameristar kansas city that began in see ameristar kansas city above for further discussion 
markets and competition st 
charles market

see risk factors below for further discussion on the nebraska proposals 
vicksburg market 
the primary market for ameristar vicksburg is residents of the jackson and vicksburg  mississippi and monroe  louisiana areas  tourists coming to vicksburg primarily to visit the vicksburg national military park  and other traffic traveling on interstate  a major east west thoroughfare that connects atlanta and dallas 
the vicksburg national military park  located within three miles of ameristar vicksburg  draws over million registered visitors a year 
vicksburg  with a population of approximately  is located miles west of jackson  the capital of mississippi

approximately million people lived within a mile radius of vicksburg during gross gaming revenues in the vicksburg gaming market for the twelve month reporting period ended december  were approximately million  an increase of over million for the twelve months ended december  competition 
ameristar vicksburg is subject to competition from three local competitors and from casinos in shreveport and bossier city  louisiana 
ameristar vicksburg is also subject to competition from two casinos owned by a native american tribe in philadelphia  mississippi  located about miles east of jackson and miles east of vicksburg 
the native american tribe opened its second gaming and hotel facility near its existing property in the third quarter of  which in effect doubled the available gaming space and hotel room count 
several potential gaming sites still exist in warren county and vicksburg and from time to time potential competitors propose the development of additional casinos in or near vicksburg 
two developers recently announced their desire to develop new casinos in vicksburg  but neither has yet taken any affirmative steps to proceed with its development 
in addition  proposals have been made from time to time to develop native american casinos in louisiana and mississippi  some of which could be competitive with the vicksburg market if completed 
jackpot market 
we believe that approximately of the customer base of the jackpot properties consists of residents of idaho who generally frequent the properties on an overnight or turnaround basis 
the primary markets are twin falls located approximately miles north of jackpot  boise and eastern idaho both of which are approximately miles from jackpot 
the balance of the jackpot properties customers come primarily from oregon  washington  montana  northern california and the southwestern canadian provinces 

table of contents although many of the customers from beyond southern idaho are tourists traveling to other destinations  a significant portion of these customers come to jackpot as a final destination 
competition 
we have developed a dominant share of the market capacity in jackpot 
the jackpot properties compete with four other hotels and motels three of which also have casinos 
according to the nevada state gaming control board and other sources  as of december   the jackpot properties accounted for approximately of the lodging rooms  of the slot machines and of the table games in jackpot 
we believe cactus petes is the premier property in jackpot  offering a more attractive environment and a broader and higher quality range of gaming and leisure activities than those of its competitors 
it has received designation by the aaa as a four diamond property since we are not aware of any other expansion plans by existing or potential competitors in jackpot in the near future  however  casinos with video lottery terminals vlt similar to slot machines are operated on native american land in idaho  including one near pocatello with approximately vlt machines that has been operated by the shoshone bannock tribes 
in november  the electorate passed proposition  which legalized specific ticket pay gaming machines on indian reservations in the state  along with a limited growth plan allowing an increase of in machine count per year  not to exceed over the next years  with a subsequent renegotiation of compacts thereafter 
a legal challenge to proposition has been filed and is currently pending 
litigation is also pending concerning the scope of gaming permitted under the compact between the state of idaho and the shoshone bannock tribes 
in addition  casino gaming on native american lands in both western washington and northeast oregon has been in operation for several years and casinos also operate in alberta  canada 
employees and labor relations as of march   we employed approximately  employees 
none of our employees is employed pursuant to collective bargaining or other union arrangements 
we believe our employee relations are good 
risk factors the gaming industry is very competitive and increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
the gaming industry is very competitive and we face dynamic competitive pressures in each of our markets 
several of our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources than we do 
we may be required to take actions in response to competitors that may increase our marketing costs and other operating expenses 
our operating properties are located in jurisdictions that restrict gaming to certain areas or are adjacent to states that prohibit or restrict gaming operations 
these restrictions and prohibitions provide substantial benefits to our business and our ability to attract and retain customers 
the legalization or expanded legalization or authorization of gaming within or near a market area of one of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
economic difficulties faced by state governments could lead to intensified political pressure for the expansion of legalized gaming 

table of contents from time to time  legislation and ballot measures have been unsuccessfully proposed in kansas and nebraska for the legalization of gaming  and the legislatures of these states are currently considering various proposals to legalize gaming that may be adopted 
these proposals would authorize gaming in or near  among other places  omaha  nebraska and kansas city  kansas  in close proximity to our existing facilities in council bluffs  iowa and kansas city  missouri  respectively 
the legalization of gaming in these locations and the additional competition resulting from the subsequent development of competing gaming properties could have a material adverse affect on us 
even if the current proposals are unsuccessful  we expect similar proposals will be made in the future and may be adopted 
in addition  the missouri gaming commission is currently accepting applications for an additional gaming license in the st 
louis area 
members of the missouri gaming commission have also stated that they would like to see a currently operating casino in downtown st 
louis improved or replaced 
if an additional gaming license is granted or the competing facility in downtown st 
louis is improved  ameristar st 
charles would face additional competition 
in addition  two developers recently announced their desire to develop new casinos in vicksburg  but neither has yet taken any affirmative steps to proceed with its development 
in addition  the entry into our current markets of additional competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  particularly if a competitor were to obtain a license to operate a gaming facility in a superior location 
native american gaming facilities in some instances operate under regulatory and financial requirements that are less stringent than those imposed on state licensed casinos  which could provide them with a competitive advantage and lead to increased competition in our markets 
furthermore  increases in the popularity of  and competition from  internet and other account wagering gaming services  which allow customers to wager on a wide variety of sporting events and play las vegas style casino games from home  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees  our results could be adversely affected 
state and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees on gaming activities 
from time to time  legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws  or in the administration of such laws  affecting the gaming industry 
periods of economic downturn and budget deficits such as currently exist in most states may intensify the efforts of state and local governments to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes 
in  large gaming tax increases were enacted in illinois and indiana 
the governor of missouri recently proposed a significant increase in gaming taxes and admission fees and the elimination of the existing loss limit per two hour cruise  although no bill has been introduced to date in the legislature 
a similar tax proposal was defeated in the missouri legislature in the iowa supreme court ruled in that a differential in the gaming tax rate between slot operations at racetracks currently  increasing over time to and riverboat casinos violates the equal protection clauses of the iowa and united states constitutions  and a lower state court subsequently ruled that the racetracks were due a refund of taxes paid in excess of a rate for prior periods 
the iowa supreme court s ruling is currently on appeal to the united states supreme court  which 
table of contents is expected to issue its decision by july if the iowa supreme court decision is not reversed or a settlement is not reached with the iowa racetracks  it is likely that the iowa legislature will seek to increase gaming taxes on riverboat casinos in order to overcome the budgetary constraints resulting from this court decision 
if the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase gaming taxes or fees  depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors such as the elimination of the loss limit in missouri  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our business is subject to restrictions and limitations imposed by gaming regulatory authorities that could adversely affect us 
the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
the states of missouri  iowa  mississippi and nevada and the applicable local authorities require various licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals to be held by us and our subsidiaries 
the missouri gaming commission  the iowa racing and gaming commission  the mississippi gaming commission and the nevada gaming commission may  among other things  limit  condition  suspend  revoke or not renew a license or approval to own the stock of any of our missouri  iowa  mississippi or nevada subsidiaries  respectively  for any cause deemed reasonable by such licensing authority 
our licenses in missouri need to be renewed every two years  our gaming license in iowa must be renewed or continued every year  and our gaming license in mississippi must be renewed every three years 
if we violate gaming laws or regulations  substantial fines could be levied against us  our subsidiaries and the persons involved  and we could be forced to forfeit portions of our assets 
the suspension  revocation or non renewal of any of our licenses or the levy on us of substantial fines or forfeiture of assets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to date  we have obtained all governmental licenses  findings of suitability  registrations  permits and approvals necessary for the operation of our currently operating gaming activities 
however  gaming licenses and related approvals are deemed to be privileges under missouri  iowa  mississippi and nevada law 
we cannot assure that our existing licenses  permits and approvals will be maintained or extended 
we also cannot assure that any new licenses  permits and approvals that may be required in the future will be granted to us 
leverage may impair our financial condition and restrict our operations and we may incur significant additional debt 
we have significant leverage and  in addition to our operating expenses  we have substantial fixed debt service obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important adverse consequences to our business  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  
table of contents requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors 
the terms of our senior credit facilities and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contain covenants that may restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow money  pay dividends and effect a consolidation  merger or disposal of substantially all of our assets 
although the covenants in our senior credit facilities and the indenture are subject to various exceptions that are intended to allow us to operate without undue restraint in certain anticipated circumstances  we cannot assure that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in other activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  our long term debt requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests  which may require that we take action to reduce our debt or to act in a manner contrary to our business objectives 
a breach of any of these covenants would result in a default under our senior credit facilities and the indenture 
if an event of default under our senior credit facilities occurs  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder  together with accrued interest  to be immediately due and payable 
in addition  our senior credit facilities are secured by first priority security interests on substantially all of our real and personal property  including the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
if we are unable to pay all amounts declared due and payable in the event of a default  the lenders could foreclose on these assets 
worsening economic conditions or geopolitical circumstances may adversely affect our business 
our business may be adversely affected by economic downturns and instability  as we are dependent on discretionary spending by our customers 
any worsening of current economic conditions could cause fewer people to spend money at our properties and could adversely affect our revenues 
other geopolitical events  such as the threat of terrorism  may deter customers from visiting our properties 
craig h 
neilsen owns a majority of our common stock and controls our affairs 
mr 
neilsen is our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board and owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
accordingly  mr 
neilsen has the ability to control our operations and affairs  including the election of the entire board of directors and  except as otherwise provided by law  other matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders  including a merger  consolidation or sale of assets 
in addition  mr 
neilsen s substantial ownership affects the liquidity in the market for our common stock 
a change in control could result in the acceleration of our debt obligations 
certain changes in control could result in the acceleration of our senior credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes 
this acceleration could be triggered in the event mr 
neilsen 
table of contents sells a significant portion of his stock or upon his death if his estate  heirs and devisees must sell a substantial number of shares of our common stock to obtain funds to pay estate tax liabilities 
we cannot assure that we would be able to repay any indebtedness that is accelerated as a result of a change in control  and this would likely materially adversely affect our financial condition 
our business may be materially impacted by an act of terrorism or by additional security requirements that may be imposed on us 
the us department of homeland security has stated that places where large numbers of people congregate  including hotels  are subject to a heightened risk of terrorism 
an act of terrorism affecting one of our properties  whether or not covered by insurance  or otherwise affecting the travel and tourism industry in the united states  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  our business may become subject to increased security measures designed to prevent terrorist acts 
recently  the us coast guard promulgated proposed regulations under the maritime transportation security act of  which would apply to all facilities and vessels on or near navigable waterways 
these regulations as currently proposed may  among other measures  require patrons of some or all of our casinos to undergo security screening and physical search and to produce photo identification 
if these or similar regulations become effective and applicable to our facilities  compliance with the increased security measures would result in increased operating costs and may reduce customer visitation  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
many factors  some of which are beyond our control  could adversely affect our ability to successfully complete our construction and development projects as planned 
general construction risks delays and cost overruns 
construction and expansion projects for our properties entail significant risks 
these risks include shortages of materials including slot machines or other gaming equipment  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental or geological problems  weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses  unanticipated cost increases  and construction period disruption to existing operations 
our anticipated costs and construction periods for construction projects are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared by us in consultation with our architects  consultants and contractors 
the cost of any construction project undertaken by us may vary significantly from initial expectations  and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns on any project 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate cash flows from operations or other financing is available 
the completion date of any of our construction projects could also differ significantly from initial expectations for construction related or other reasons 
we cannot assure that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets 
significant delays or cost overruns on our construction projects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we employ fast track design and construction methods in some of our construction and development projects 
this involves the design of future stages of construction while earlier 
table of contents stages of construction are underway 
although we believe that the use of fast track design and construction methods can reduce the overall construction time  these methods may not always result in such reductions  may involve additional construction costs than otherwise would be incurred and may increase the risk of disputes with contractors  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
construction dependent upon available financing and cash flows from operations 
the availability of funds under our senior credit facilities at any time will be dependent upon  among other factors  the amount of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda during the preceding four full fiscal quarters 
our future operating performance will be subject to financial  economic  business  competitive  regulatory and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot assure that our future consolidated ebitda and the resulting availability of operating cash flows or borrowing capacity will be sufficient to allow us to undertake or complete current or future construction projects 
as a result of operating risks  including those described in this section  and other risks associated with a new venture  we cannot assure that  once completed  any development project will increase our operating profits or operating cash flows 
if our key personnel leaves us  our business will be significantly adversely affected 
we depend on the continued performance of craig h 
neilsen  our president  chief executive officer and chairman  and his management team 
thomas m 
steinbauer  ameristar s senior vice president of finance  has announced his intention to leave us  and we are currently seeking a replacement for mr 
steinbauer 
if we lose the services of mr 
neilsen  any of our other executive officers or our senior property management personnel and cannot replace such persons in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the market for qualified property and corporate management personnel is subject to intense competition 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience strong competition in hiring and retaining qualified property and corporate management personnel 
recruiting and retaining qualified management personnel is particularly difficult at ameristar vicksburg and the jackpot properties due to local market conditions 
if we are unable to successfully recruit and retain qualified management personnel at our properties or at our corporate level  our results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
adverse weather conditions in the areas in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
adverse weather conditions  particularly flooding  heavy snowfall and other extreme conditions  can deter our customers from traveling or make it difficult for them to frequent our properties 
if any of our properties were to experience prolonged adverse weather conditions  or if our midwestern properties were to simultaneously experience adverse weather conditions  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 

table of contents any loss from service of our riverboat and dockside facilities for any reason could materially adversely affect us 
our riverboat and dockside facilities in missouri  iowa and mississippi could be lost from service due to casualty  mechanical failure  extended or extraordinary maintenance  floods or other severe weather conditions 
cruises of the council bluffs casino vessel are subject to risks generally incident to the movement of vessels on inland waterways  including risks of casualty due to river turbulence and severe weather conditions 
in addition  us coast guard regulations set limits on the operation of vessels and require that vessels be operated by a minimum complement of licensed personnel 
the us coast guard also requires all united states flagged passenger vessels operating exclusively in fresh water to conduct a thorough dry dock inspection of underwater machinery  valves and hull every five years 
less stringent inspection requirements apply to permanently moored dockside vessels like those at ameristar kansas city  ameristar st 
charles and ameristar vicksburg 
the ameristar council bluffs riverboat was due for its dry dock inspection in november  but we have been accepted into a us coast guard program that has extended the dry dock requirement to october by undergoing a thorough underwater inspection 
if we are unable to continue to extend the dry dock requirement by performing thorough underwater hull inspections  the council bluffs casino would be out of service for a substantial period of time for its dry dock inspection 
this could have a material adverse effect on ameristar council bluffs and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure that we will actually obtain any further extension of the dry dock requirement or that similar extensions will be obtained in the future 
the ameristar vicksburg site has experienced some instability that requires periodic maintenance and improvements 
although in we reinforced the cofferdam basin in which the vessel floats  further reinforcements may be necessary 
we are also monitoring the site to evaluate what further steps  if any  may be necessary to stabilize the site to permit operations to continue 
a site failure would require ameristar vicksburg to limit or cease operations 
the loss of a riverboat or dockside facility from service for any period of time likely would adversely affect our operating results and borrowing capacity under our long term debt facilities 
it could also result in the occurrence of an event of a default under our credit agreement 
we could face severe penalties and material remediation costs if we fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
as is the case with any owner or operator of real property  we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  emission and disposal of hazardous materials 
failure to comply with environmental laws could result in the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on operations by government agencies or courts  which could adversely affect our operations 
we do not have environmental liability insurance to cover most such events  and the environmental liability insurance coverage we maintain to cover certain events includes significant limitations and exclusions 
in addition  if we discover any significant environmental contamination affecting any of our 
table of contents properties  we could face material remediation costs or additional development costs for future expansion activities 
government regulation the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities are subject to extensive state and local regulation 
we are required to obtain and maintain gaming licenses in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct gaming 
the limitation  conditioning or suspension of gaming licenses could and the revocation or non renewal of gaming licenses  or the failure to reauthorize gaming in certain jurisdictions  would materially adversely affect our operations in that jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in law that restrict or prohibit our gaming operations in any jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on us

the proposals were declared illegal by mississippi courts on constitutional and procedural grounds 
the latest ruling was appealed to the mississippi supreme court  which affirmed the decision of the lower court 
if another such proposal were to be made and if a sufficient number of signatures were to be gathered to place a legal initiative on the ballot  it would be possible for the voters of mississippi to consider such a proposal in november while we are unable to predict whether such an initiative will appear on a ballot or the likelihood of such an initiative being approved by the voters  if such an initiative were approved and gaming were prohibited in mississippi  it would have a significant adverse effect on us and our operations

gaming taxes are based upon the following a percentage of the gross gaming revenues received by the casino operation  the number of gaming devices operated by the casino  or the number of table games operated by the casino 

table of contents the license fee payable to the state of mississippi is based upon gaming receipts generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to customers as winnings and the current maximum tax rate imposed is of all gaming receipts in excess of  per month 
the foregoing license fees we pay are allowed as a credit against acvi s mississippi income tax liability for the year paid 
the gross revenues fee imposed by the city of vicksburg equals approximately of gaming receipts 
the mississippi commission s regulations require as a condition of licensure or license renewal that an existing licensed gaming establishment s plan include a car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which amount to at least of the casino cost 
the mississippi commission later adopted amendments to the regulation that would increase the infrastructure development requirement from to for new casinos or upon the acquisition of a closed casino  but would grandfather existing licensees 
we believe that acvi is in compliance with the previously existing infrastructure requirement and is not subject to the increased infrastructure requirement

furthermore  depreciation expense increased by million in the same period as the result of the substantial increase in the base of depreciable assets after the new facility opened 
the operating income margin at ameristar st 
charles has been steadily improving since the new facility opened in august in february  operating income margin at the property was  compared to for the period from august through december this improvement is largely attributable to improved operating efficiencies through cost control measures implemented to date  especially in the areas of labor and marketing  as well as the heightened customer awareness of the scope and quality of the new facility 
income from operations at ameristar kansas city declined from million in to million in  representing a decrease of million  or 
the property s results were adversely impacted by business disruption associated with the ongoing construction of enhancements to the casino and entertainment facilities that began in july in addition  higher labor and related costs primarily as a result of increased health insurance costs as well as additional expenses directly related to increased revenues  including gaming taxes and other expenses attributable to player development strategies  were principally responsible for the increase in operating expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of the absence of goodwill amortization expense in compared to million recorded in the prior year 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
the renovation and enhancement project at ameristar kansas city includes significant improvements to the casino and land based amenities

ameristar vicksburg s income from operations of million in represents an increase of million  or  as compared to similar to ameristar council bluffs  higher revenues due to the factors discussed above and greater operating efficiencies contributed to the improvement in operating results at ameristar vicksburg 
the increase was partially offset by million of impairment loss on gaming equipment held for sale 

table of contents the jackpot properties reported income from operations of million in  a million  or  increase as compared to this increase was due to increased revenues as discussed above 
corporate operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to this increase was mainly attributable to the increase in corporate payroll as a result of our growth since the acquisition of the missouri properties in december as well as the consolidation of certain management functions at the corporate level in order to achieve operating efficiencies and consistency 
interest expense consolidated interest expense  net of capitalized interest of million in and million in  was million in compared to million in this reduction reflects a lower average interest rate on our outstanding debt due to a decline in the libor rate  the amendment of our senior credit facilities in may to reduce our borrowing cost and an increase by standard poors ratings services in september of the rating on our senior secured debt to bb  which further reduced the interest rate on a portion of our senior credit facilities  a million write off in the first quarter of of unamortized interim credit facility loan fees and prepayment premiums on retired senior debt  and a million decrease in recorded interest expense from to associated with the fair value of the interest rate collar agreement covering million principal amount of indebtedness under our senior credit facilities 
these factors were partially offset by a higher weighted average outstanding debt level in  as we borrowed million under the senior credit facilities to fund construction projects and million from a commercial bank to finance equipment purchases for the new st 
charles facility during after the opening of the new casino and entertainment facility at ameristar st 
charles in august  we no longer capitalized the interest payments associated with borrowings made to fund construction

income tax expense our effective federal income tax rate was in and in the federal income tax statutory rate was in both years

table of contents we historically have funded our daily operations through net cash provided by operating activities and our significant capital expenditures primarily through operating cash flows  bank debt and other debt financing 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash and cash equivalents and availability under our senior credit facilities will support our operations and liquidity requirements  including current capital expenditure plans  for the foreseeable future 
our ability to borrow funds under our senior credit facilities at any time is primarily dependent upon the amount of our ebitda  as defined for purposes of our senior credit facilities  for the preceding four fiscal quarters 
as of december   in addition to the million available for borrowing under the senior credit facilities  we had million of cash and cash equivalents  approximately million of which were required for daily operations 
we did not make any federal income tax payments in in  we paid million in estimated federal income tax payments through quarterly installments

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in sec release no 

table of contents contractual and other commitments the following table summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under certain contracts  including long term debt obligations  capitalized leases  operating leases and certain construction contracts 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations after total long term debt instruments capital leases operating leases material construction contracts total payments due by period in thousands other commitments after total letters of credit we routinely enter into operational contracts in the ordinary course of our business  including construction contracts for minor projects that are not material to our business or financial condition as a whole 
our commitments relating to these contracts are recognized as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets when services are provided with respect to such contracts 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit in the amount of million  which reduced the amount available to borrow under our senior credit facilities 
we do not have any other guarantees  contingent commitments or other material liabilities that are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
certain of our accounting policies require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
our judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates 
we believe the policies and estimates discussed below have a significant impact on issues that are inherently uncertain 
property and equipment we have significant capital invested in our property and equipment  which represents approximately of our total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of the asset 
we assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy  which we believe is representative of the useful life of each category of assets 
we review the carrying value of our property and equipment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
the factors we consider in performing this assessment include 
table of contents current operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effect of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets we have approximately million in goodwill and other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet resulting from our acquisition of the missouri properties 
according to the requirements of sfas no 
 which we adopted on january   we completed our initial assessment and our annual assessment for impairment and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the assessment in both cases requires the use of estimates about future operating results of each reporting unit to determine its estimated fair value 
changes in forecasted operations can materially affect these estimates 
star awards program our customer reward program  star awards  allows customers to earn certain point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services based on the volume of the customers gaming activity 
customers can accumulate or bank reward points over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program 
the reward credit balance will be forfeited if a customer does not earn any reward credits over any subsequent twelve month period 
as a result of the ability of the customer to bank the reward points  we accrue the expense of reward points  after giving effect to estimated forfeitures  as they are earned 
at december  and  million and million  respectively  was accrued 
the value of these point based cash rewards or complimentary goods and services are netted against revenue as a promotional allowance 
our players are also awarded cash coupons based on their play volume 
the coupons are redeemable within a short time period  generally seven days  and are redeemable only on a return visit 
there is no ability to renew or extend the offer 
we recognize a reduction in revenue as a promotional allowance for these coupons when the coupons are redeemed and  as a result  no liability associated with this item was recorded on our balance sheets as of december  and self funded employee health care insurance program our employee health care benefits program is self funded up to a maximum amount per claim 
accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
at december   our estimated liabilities for unpaid and incurred but not reported claims totaled million 
we consider historical loss experience and certain unusual claims in estimating these liabilities 
we believe the use of this method to account for these liabilities provides a consistent and effective way to measure these highly judgmental accruals  however  changes in health care costs  accident or illness frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
we continually monitor the potential for changes in estimates  evaluate our insurance accruals and adjust our recorded provisions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior credit facilities  and we utilize interest rate swap and collar agreements to manage this risk

of this amount  million is covered by an interest rate swap agreement that 
table of contents fixes the interest rate thereon and million is covered by an interest rate collar agreement that sets a floor and ceiling for the interest rate thereon see note notes payable and long term debt of notes to consolidated financial statements for more discussion on the derivative instruments 
other than the borrowings under the senior credit facilities that are not covered by the interest rate swap agreement and million in other long term debt outstanding at december  collectively  the variable rate debt  all of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
the variable rate debt bears interest equal to libor in the case of eurodollar loans or the prime interest rate in the case of base rate loans  plus an applicable margin 
at december   the average interest rate applicable to the variable rate debt was 
an increase of one percentage point in the average interest rate applicable to the variable rate debt outstanding at december  would increase our annual interest cost by approximately million 
we continue to monitor interest rate markets and may enter into interest rate collar or swap agreements for additional amounts of principal under the senior credit facilities as market conditions warrant
