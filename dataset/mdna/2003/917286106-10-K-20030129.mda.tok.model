liquidity and capital resources sources of capital the company s sources of liquidity and capital resources include its cash and cash equivalents  proceeds from bank borrowings and long term mortgage debt  capital financings and sales of real estate investments 
payments of expenses related to real estate operations  debt service  management and professional fees  and dividend requirements place demands on the company s short term liquidity 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements primarily by generating net cash from the operations of its properties 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity requirements for fiscal and to meet its dividend requirements necessary to maintain its reit status 
in fiscal  and  net cash provided by operations amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
dividends paid to stockholders of the company in fiscal  and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from tenants under existing leases at its properties 
the company s operating cash flow therefore depends on the rents that it is able to charge to its tenants  and the ability of its tenants to make rental payments 
the company believes that the nature of the properties in which it typically invests primarily grocery anchored neighborhood and community shopping centers provides a more stable revenue flow in uncertain economic times  in that consumers still need to purchase basic staples and convenience items 
however  even in the geographic areas in which the company owns properties  general economic downturns may adversely impact the ability of the company s tenants to make lease payments and the company s ability to re lease space as leases expire 
in either of these cases  the company s cash flow could be adversely affected 
the company expects to fund its long term liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  repayment of indebtedness and capital expenditures through other long term indebtedness including indebtedness assumed in acquisitions  proceeds from sales of non core properties and or the issuance of equity securities 
the company believes that these sources of capital will continue to be available to it in the future to fund its long term capital needs  however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on its access to capital sources 
the company s ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon its existing leverage  the value of its unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by existing lenders 
the company s ability to raise funds through sales of equity securities is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about the company and its stock price in the market 
the company s ability to sell properties in the future to raise cash will be dependent upon market conditions at the time of sale 
at october   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million in the company also had million in liquid short term investments as of october  the company s cash positions and short term investments reflect the temporary investment of the net proceeds received from the sales of the company s class a common shares during fiscal and financings in fiscal  the company completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of its class a common stock 
the net proceeds to the company after deducting underwriting fees and expenses was million 
a portion of the proceeds was used to repay million of outstanding revolving credit line indebtedness 
the balance of the net proceeds of the offering is expected to be used to acquire properties 
in december  the company acquired two properties utilizing approximately million in cash 
in november  the company also sold  shares to its underwriters to cover over allotments in connection with the company s stock offering of  shares in fiscal net proceeds to the company amounted to  in fiscal  the company completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of its class a common stock 
the net proceeds to the company after deducting underwriting fees and expenses was million 
the company also sold  shares of common stock and  shares of class a common stock in a private placement for total proceeds of  the company used the proceeds of these offerings to complete the acquisitions of two properties  repay outstanding credit line borrowings and repurchase  shares of its series b preferred stock at a cost of million 
at october   the company had a million secured revolving credit facility with a bank which expires in fiscal and a conditional million unsecured revolving line of credit with the same bank which expires in fiscal the revolving credit lines are available to finance the acquisition  management and or development of commercial real estate  refinance indebtedness and for working capital purposes 
extensions of credit under the unsecured credit line are at the bank s discretion and subject to the bank s satisfaction of certain conditions 
during  the company borrowed million on the secured credit line to complete the acquisition of the ridgeway shopping center  stamford  connecticut see below 
borrowings were fully repaid from the proceeds of the sale of equity securities in fiscal there were no borrowings during the year under the unsecured credit line and there were no outstanding borrowings on either line of credit at october  the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
at october   the company s contractual obligations for borrowings are as follows payments due by period amount less than year  to years  to years  after years  borrowings consist of  of fixed rate mortgage loan indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of at october  the mortgage loans are secured by fourteen properties and have fixed rates of interest ranging from to 
the company expects to refinance certain of these borrowings  at or prior to maturity  through new mortgage loans on real estate 
the ability to do so  however  is dependent upon various factors  including the income level of the properties  interest rates and credit conditions within the commercial real estate market 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that such refinancings can be achieved 
capital expenditures the company invests in its existing properties and regularly incurs capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business to maintain its properties 
the company believes that such expenditures enhance the competitiveness of its properties 
in fiscal  the company spent approximately million for capital expenditures including million related to tenant allowances and commissions in connection with the company s leasing activities 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly depending on tenant negotiations  market conditions and rental rates 
the company has budgeted an additional million for known capital improvements and leasing costs in fiscal these expenditures are generally funded from operating cash flows or borrowings on its credit facilities

the property was acquired subject to a million first mortgage loan  utilizing available cash of approximately million and revolving credit line borrowings of million

in december  the company acquired two properties in separate transactions for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the acquisitions were funded from available cash 
as of october   the company had contracted to purchase two additional shopping center properties for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million

the transactions are expected to close during the first half of fiscal in fiscal  the company acquired two properties for million 
one property was acquired subject to a first mortgage loan of million 
the purchases were financed from available cash and borrowings under the company s revolving credit lines 
in a prior year  the company s board of directors expanded and refined the strategic objectives of the company to refocus its real estate portfolio into one of self managed retail properties located in the northeast and authorized a plan to sell the non core properties of the company in the normal course of business over a period of several years 
the company intends to sell the non core properties as opportunities become available 
the company has selectively effected asset sales to generate cash proceeds over the last several years 
the company s ability to generate cash from asset sales is dependent upon market conditions and will necessarily be limited if market conditions make such sales unattractive 
in fiscal  the company sold two non core properties for million and a shopping center for million 
at october   the remaining non core properties total four properties with a net book value of approximately million and consist of two distribution service facilities  one office building and one retail property all of which are located outside of the northeast region of the united states 
funds from operations the company considers funds from operations ffo to be one supplemental financial measure of an equity reit s operating performance 
ffo is calculated as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and debt restructuring and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company considers recoveries of investments in properties subject to finance leases to be analogous to amortization for purposes of calculating ffo 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of the company s operating performance or for cash flows as a measure of liquidity or its dividend paying capacity 
furthermore  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to the company s calculation of ffo 
the table below provides a reconciliation of net income in accordance with gaap to ffo for each of the years ended october   and amounts in thousands 
net income applicable to common and class a common stockholders    plus real property depreciation    amortization of tenant improvements and allowances    amortization of deferred leasing costs recoveries of investments in properties subject to finance leases adjustments for unconsolidated joint venture  less excess of carrying value over cost to repurchase preferred shares  gains on sales of real estate investments  funds from operations    net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by used in financing activities    results of operations fiscal vs 
fiscal revenues revenues from operating leases increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in operating lease revenues resulted from additional rental revenues from new properties acquired during both years and leasing of previously vacant space at the company s core properties

in fiscal  the overall leasing levels at the company s properties decreased to compared to leased in the year ago period 
additionally  the company s total property occupancy levels decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in leasing and occupancy levels was principally caused by the loss of a tenant occupying  square feet at the company s five town plaza shopping center and a tenant occupying  square feet at the company s office property in southfield  michigan who re leased  square feet of its previously occupied space 
the balance of the space remains vacant at october  the company re leased the  square feet of space at five town plaza

operating lease income also increased by  from the reclassification of three net leases previously accounted for as direct finance leases in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
during the year  one of the properties was sold and the net leases of the remaining two properties expired 
the new leases were classified as operating leases 
lease termination income of  represents a settlement of the company s claims against a former tenant arising from the tenant s bankruptcy and rejection of its lease at one of the company s properties 
the company had an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture which was accounted for under the equity method 
the joint venture owned the countryside square shopping center in clearwater  florida

the increase in interest expense was partially offset by mortgage loans repaid during the year 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million from million in fiscal from the expenditure of million for property improvements  tenant allowances and leasing costs during the year 
the company also wrote off  of unamortized tenant allowances related to former tenants who vacated space during the year 
application of critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the company s critical accounting policies are those applicable to the evaluation of the collectibility of accounts and notes receivable and the evaluation of impairment of long term assets 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable is established based on quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts 
the analysis places particular emphasis on past due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables  the payment history of the tenants or other debtors  the financial condition of the tenants and management s assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations  the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations  among other things 
management s estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants  particularly those at retail centers 
rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant receivables on the accompanying balance sheets 
it is the company s policy to maintain an allowance for future tenant credit losses of approximately of the deferred straight line rent receivable balance 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties and mortgage notes receivable may be impaired 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the asset 
management does not believe that the value of any of its rental properties or mortgage notes receivable is impaired at october  recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which updates and clarifies the accounting and reporting for impairment of assets held in use and to be disposed of 
the statement  among other things  will require the company to classify the operations and cash flow of properties to be disposed of as discontinued operations 
the company will adopt the provisions of the statement in fiscal  and does not expect the statement to have a material impact on the company s financial position or results from operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
adoption of the provisions of the statement in fiscal will not have any impact since the company will continue to use the intrinsic value method as set forth in apb inflation the company s long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on its operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling the company to receive i scheduled base rent increases and ii percentage rents based upon tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise 
in addition  many of the company s non anchor leases are for terms of less than ten years  which permits the company to seek increases in rents upon renewal at then current market rates if rents provided in the expiring leases are below then existing market rates 
most of the company s leases require tenants to pay a share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing the company s expose to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
environmental matters based upon management s ongoing review of its properties  management is not aware of any environmental condition with respect to any of the company s properties which would be reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company 
there can be no assurance  however  that i the discovery of environmental conditions  which were previously unknown  ii changes in law  iii the conduct of tenants or iv activities relating to properties in the vicinity of the company s properties  will not expose the company to material liability in the future 
changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions may result in significant unanticipated expenditures or may otherwise adversely affect the operations of the company s tenants  which would adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities 
there is inherent rollover risk for borrowings as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the company s future financing requirements 
as of october   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its secured and unsecured line of credit arrangements 
during the twelve month periods ended october  and  the average variable rate indebtedness outstanding during such periods had a combined weighted average interest rate of and 
had the weighted average interest rate been basis points higher  the company s net income would have been lower by approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively
