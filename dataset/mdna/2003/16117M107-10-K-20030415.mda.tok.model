products and services we offer our customers traditional video programming analog and digital video as well as data services high speed internet and in some areas advanced high bandwidth services such as video on demand and interactive television 
our video programming and data services are sold on a subscription basis  with prices and related charges that vary primarily based on the type of services selected  whether the services are sold as a bundle versus on an a la carte basis  and the equipment necessary to receive the services  with some variation in prices depending on geographic location 
to date  telephony has been made available to only a limited number of customers 
we believe that our network architecture  with digital capability  high bandwidth capacity and two way activated plant  enables us to be a leader in the introduction of new and advanced services 
our advanced services include or may include video on demand  high definition television  telephony using voice over internet protocol technology  private network services  such as voice and data transmission services to a network of interconnected locations of a single customer  and various interactive features  such as virtual interactive channels for news  finance  weather  sports  shopping  movie theater listings  games  an interactive program guide and interactive on screen broadcast programming

prior to publicly reporting the number of total analog video customers as of september  and december   we deducted  and  customers  respectively  from the numbers shown on the billing records as a reserve 
of the total customers reported for december    customers were days overdue   customers were days overdue  and  customers were more than days overdue 
of the total customers reported for december    customers were days overdue   customers were days overdue  and  customers were more than days overdue 
such delinquent customers represent and of total customers as of december  and  respectively 
for and  our year end financial statements reflect a reserve for uncollectible accounts that we deemed sufficient 
the adequacy of the  and  customer reductions  our disconnect policies  the application of those policies and their effect on the customer totals reported by us during and prior periods are currently under investigation by the united states attorney s office for the eastern district of missouri and the securities and exchange commission 
those investigations are not complete 
upon the completion of such investigations  and depending on their outcome  we may make additional adjustments in the or prior periods customer numbers if such adjustments are appropriate 
when we publicly announced our results on february   we also 
table of contents announced that we expected the number of customers to decline by  during the first quarter of we ultimately reported a loss of  customers in that quarter 
the customer reduction was primarily the result of eliminating non paying or delinquent customers from the customer totals 
b homes passed represents the estimated number of living units  such as single family homes  apartment units and condominium units passed by the cable distribution network in a given area to which we offer the service indicated 
homes passed excludes commercial units passed by the cable distribution network 
c analog video customers include all customers who purchase video services including those who also purchase data and telephony services  but excludes approximately  and  customer relationships  respectively  who pay for cable modem service only and who are only counted as cable modem customers 
this represents a change in our methodology from prior reports through september   in which cable modem only customer relationships were included within our analog video customers 
we made this change because we determined that most of these customers were unable to receive our most basic level of analog service because this service was physically secured or blocked  was unavailable in certain areas or the customers were unaware that this service was available to them 
had we previously utilized this new reporting methodology  analog video customers excluding cable modem only would have been approximately  as of september  commercial and multi dwelling structures are calculated on an equivalent bulk unit ebu basis 
ebu is calculated for a system by dividing the bulk price charged to accounts in an area by the most prevalent price charged to non bulk residential customers in that market for the comparable tier of service 
the ebu method of estimating analog video customers is consistent with the methodology used in determining costs paid to programmers and has been consistently applied year over year 
as we increase our effective analog prices to residential customers without a corresponding increase in the prices charged to commercial service or multi dwelling customers  our ebu count will decline even if there is no real loss in commercial service or multi dwelling customers 
our policy is not to count complimentary accounts such as our employees as customers 
d penetration represents customers as a percentage of homes passed 
e digital video customers include all households that have one or more digital set top terminals 
included in digital video customers at december  and are approximately  and approximately  customers  respectively  that receive digital video service directly through satellite transmission 
f represents the number of digital video customers as a percentage of analog video customers 
g as noted above  all of these customers also receive video service and are included in the video statistics above  except that the video statistics do not include approximately  and  customers at december  and  respectively  who were cable modem only customers 
h commercial cable modem or data customers historically were calculated on an equivalent modem unit or emu basis  which involves converting commercial revenues to residential customer counts 
emu s calculated under the historical method were approximately  and approximately  as of december  and  respectively 
commercial emus are not included in the above table 
i revenue generating units represent the sum total of all primary analog video  digital video  high speed data and telephony customers  not counting additional outlets within one household 
for example  a customer who receives two types of services such as analog video and digital video would be treated as two revenue generating units  and if that customer added on data service  the customer would be treated as three revenue generating units 
this statistic is computed in accordance with the guidelines of the national cable telecommunications association that have been adopted by eleven publicly traded cable operators including charter communications  inc as an industry standard 
j telephony customers include all households purchasing telephone service 
on january    telephony customers were acquired as a result of the at t broadband transaction 
k customer relationships include the number of customers that receive at least one level of service encompassing video  data and telephony services  without regard to which service s such customers purchase 
this statistic is computed in accordance with the guidelines of the national cable telecommunications association that have been adopted by eleven publicly traded cable operators including charter communications  inc as an industry standard

video services 
our video service offerings include the following basic cable 
all of our video customers receive a package of basic programming  transmitted via an analog signal  which generally consists of local broadcast television  local community programming  including governmental and public access  and limited satellite delivered or non broadcast channels 
our basic line up generally has between and channels 
expanded basic cable 
this expanded programming level includes a package of satellite delivered or non broadcast channels such as espn  cnn and lifetime television  and generally has between and channels  in addition to the basic channel line up 
premium channels 
these channels provide commercial free movies  sports and other special event entertainment programming 
home box office  cinemax  showtime  the movie channel  starz and encore are examples of premium channels 
although we offer subscriptions to premium channels on an individual basis  we are offering an increasing number of premium channel packages and offer premium channels with our advanced services 
pay per view 
these channels allow customers to pay on a per event basis to view a single showing of a recently released movie  a one time special sporting event or music concert on a commercial free basis 
digital tiers 
we offer digital service to our customers in several different service combination packages 
all digital packages include a digital set top terminal  an interactive electronic programming guide  up to channels of cd quality digital music  an expanded menu of pay per view channels from to additional video channels 
certain digital packages also offer customers one or more premium channels of their choice with multiplexes 
multiplexes give customers access to several different versions of the same premium channel which are varied as to time of broadcast such as east and west coast time slots or programming content theme such as westerns or romance 
some digital tier packages are focused on the interests of a particular customer demographic and emphasize  for example  sports  movies  family or ethnic programming 
other digital packages bundle digital television with other advanced services  such as high speed internet access 
data services 
we offer high speed internet service to our residential and commercial customers primarily via cable modems attached to personal computers 
we generally offer high speed internet access services under the charter pipeline brand  although in certain markets we offer this service in conjunction with a third party provider 
for our charter pipeline customers  we have a custom start page that is co branded with microsoft corporation s network of websites  known as msn  with content modules that we provide  including  for example  movie trailers  previews of movies on pay per view and video on demand  and television listings 
in  we began to offer a self install option for cable modems 
we also offer traditional dial up internet access and television based internet access in a very limited number of our markets 
advanced services 
we continue to test  evaluate and  in some cases  offer new advanced services that we believe could either provide new revenue streams to offset overall increasing program costs or enhance our appeal to consumers to counter competitive threats 
in that regard  in addition to our core video and data service offerings  we continue to develop and explore various advanced services on a limited basis 
further development  deployment and marketing of these advanced services will be determined based on perceived consumer demand  revenue opportunity and their ability to enhance sales of our core services 
these advanced services include video on demand 
we offer video on demand vod service  by which customers can access hundreds of movies and other programming at any time  with digital picture quality 
in some cases we offer subscription video on demand commonly known as svod  or vod programming that is available on a category basis  for a single monthly fee 
telephony voice services 
we are exploring technologies using internet protocol telephony to transmit digital voice signals over our systems 
in september  we commercially deployed internet protocol telephony to approximately  homes passed in one market 
we also offer traditional switch based telephony to approximately  homes passed in one area as a result of an acquisition 
high definition television 
we began to offer high definition television hdtv on a limited basis in markets in the second half of hdtv will provide our digital customers with video services at a higher resolution than standard television 
business network services 
we offer integrated network solutions to commercial and institutional customers 
these solutions include data and video services 
in addition  we offer high speed internet services to local businesses 

table of contents other new business initiatives 
in july  we commenced a test of an advanced broadband media center terminal manufactured by motorola  inc this media center terminal  which is not yet ready for commercial deployment  includes digital video recording capabilities commonly referred to as dvr  advanced graphics and navigation services  interactive data products  as well as other enhanced features  and operates in conjunction with certain existing digital set top terminals 
built in dvr capability in the set top terminal would enable customers to store video and audio content 
a stand alone media center unit is also planned for development 
digeo  inc collaborated with us on the design for the advanced broadband media centers 
a charter communications  inc subsidiary and an affiliate of mr 
allen both own equity interests in digeo  inc see item certain relationships and related transaction business relationships 
sale of advertising 
we receive revenue from the sale of local advertising on satellite delivered networks such as mtv  cnn and espn 
in any particular market  we generally insert local advertising on a minimum of four networks  and have covered up to channels 
our system rebuild and digital services launches have increased the number of available channels on which we are able to insert local advertising 
we also provide cross channel advertising to certain programmers 
pricing for our products and services our revenues are derived principally from the monthly fees our customers pay for various services we offer 
the prices we charge vary based on the market served and level of service selected and are usually adjusted on an annual basis 
as of december   the average monthly fee was for analog video service and for expanded analog video service 
a one time installation fee  which is often waived during certain promotional periods for a standard installation  is charged to new customers 
in accordance with the federal communications commission s rules  the prices we charge for cable related equipment  such as set top terminals and remote control devices  and for installation services are based on actual costs plus a permitted rate of return 
although our service offerings vary by market because of differences in the bandwidth capacity of the cable systems in each of our markets and competitive and regulatory factors  our services  when offered on a stand alone basis  are typically offered at monthly price ranges  excluding franchise fees and other taxes  as follows price range as of service december  basic cable expanded basic cable premium channel pay per view per movie or event digital cable video packages which include high speed data for higher tiers high speed internet access by cable modem video on demand per selection our network technology we have upgraded  and expect to a limited extent to continue to upgrade on a limited basis  the technical quality and capacity of a large portion of our existing systems 
we have substantially completed our build out of new systems to a minimum bandwidth of megahertz or greater  which allows us to offer digital television  high speed internet access data services and other digital products and services  increase channel capacity up to analog channels  and add even more channels and services when our bandwidth is used for digital signal transmission  and for systems with bandwidth of at least megahertz  permit two way communication  so that internet access does not require a separate telephone line and our systems can provide interactive services  and potentially  telephony services 
we have no current plans to rebuild or upgrade any of our systems  other than those for which rebuilding or upgrading is currently in progress 
as part of our upgrade  we have substantially reduced the number of headends that serve our customers from  
table of contents at january  to at december  because headends are the control centers of a cable television system  where incoming signals are amplified  converted  processed and combined for transmission to the customer  reducing the number of headends reduces related equipment  service personnel and maintenance expenditures 
we expect that headend consolidation  together with our other upgrades  will allow us to provide enhanced picture quality and greater system reliability 
as a result of the upgrade  approximately of our customers are now served by headends serving at least  customers 
the following table describes the technological capacity of our systems as of december  and the anticipated progress of planned upgrades through  based on the percentage of our customer relationships that we expect will be served by the bandwidths listed below and will have access to two way communication capability megahertz less than to two way two way megahertz megahertz megahertz megahertz capability enabled december  december  see products and services for statistics regarding the approximate number of our customers who purchase the various services enabled by these upgrades 
as of december  our cable systems consisted of approximately  sheath miles  including approximately  sheath miles of fiber optic cable  passing approximately million households and serving approximately million customer relationships 
we have adopted the hybrid fiber coaxial cable hfc architecture as the standard for our ongoing systems upgrades 
hfc architecture combines the use of fiber optic cable with coaxial cable 
fiber optic cable is a communication medium that uses glass fibers to transmit signals over long distances with minimum signal loss or distortion 
fiber optic cable has excellent broadband frequency characteristics  noise immunity and physical durability and can carry hundreds of video  data and voice channels over extended distances 
coaxial cable is less expensive and requires a more extensive signal amplification in order to obtain the desired transmission levels for delivering channels 
in most systems  we deliver our signals via fiber optic cable from the headend to a group of nodes  and use coaxial cable to deliver the signal from individual nodes to the homes passed served by that node 
our system design enables a maximum of homes passed to be served by a single node 
currently  our average node serves approximately homes passed 
our system design provides for six strands of fiber to each node  with two strands activated and four strands reserved for spares and future services 
we believe that this hybrid network design provides high capacity and superior signal quality 
the design also provides reserve capacity for the addition of future services 
the primary advantages of hfc architecture over traditional coaxial only cable networks include increased bandwidth capacity  for more channels and other services  dedicated bandwidth for two way services  which avoids reverse signal interference problems that can otherwise occur with two way communication capability  and improved picture quality and service reliability 
we currently maintain two national network operations centers to monitor our networks and to further our strategy of providing high quality of service 
monitoring becomes increasingly important as we increase the number of customers utilizing two way high speed data service 
our enhanced dispatch centers will focus on local network operations and the reliability and performance of our advanced architecture  and will replace our existing regional operating centers 
management of our systems our operating philosophy emphasizes local management making local decisions that affect customers 
at the same time  with a view to becoming more efficient and consistent in operations  we are consolidating from three divisions and ten regions to five operating divisions and eliminating certain layers of our management structure 
each operating division will be managed and supported by operational  marketing and engineering personnel at the divisional level 
we expect this reorganization will facilitate the establishment of and adherence to standard practices  imaging and branding throughout our systems and better communication of policy decisions so as to enhance consistency of service delivery  improve operational efficiency and create the potential for cost reductions through further exploitation of economies of scale 
at the same time  we believe our new structure will still allow 
table of contents local operating decisions and implementation to remain close to the customer 
we continue to have centralized financial management by our corporate office  which enables us to set financial and operating benchmarks and monitor system performance on an ongoing basis 
our corporate office also performs certain financial and administrative functions  on a centralized basis  such as accounting  internal audit  purchasing  marketing and programming contract administration and information technology 
customer care historically  we have fielded customer service requests  inquiries and complaints through a large number of small customer service centers throughout the country 
as a consequence of our aggressive acquisition program in through  the number of these service centers grew rapidly and in was in excess of service centers 
we believe that maintaining such a large number of service centers hindered our ability to maximize the consistency of our service delivery and related customer satisfaction due to the logistical challenges and poor economies of scale inherent in maintaining and supervising such a large number of service centers 
in an effort to better serve our customers  we are consolidating our local customer care functions by operating technologically advanced  high volume customer contact centers  and as a result we have closed and expect to continue to close a number of local payment and customer service centers 
by establishing regional customer contact centers  we are able to service our customers hours a day  seven days a week and utilize technologically advanced equipment that we believe enhances interactions with our customers 
our customer care specialists receive specialized training to develop customer contact skills and product knowledge that are targeted towards prompt and responsive resolution of customer complaints and customer retention  as well as towards selling additional and higher levels of service to our customers 
at december   we operated eight of these high volume customer contact centers 
in  we expect to upgrade three additional facilities to serve as customer contact centers  and to arrange services for four additional high volume customer contact centers through third party vendors 
as of december   we had customer service locations  and our largest customer service locations serviced approximately of our customers 
programming general 
we believe that offering a wide variety of programming is an important factor that influences a customer s decision to subscribe to and retain our cable services 
we rely on market research  customer demographics and local programming preferences to determine channel offerings in each of our markets 
we obtain basic and premium programming from a number of suppliers  usually pursuant to a written contract 
our programming contracts generally continue for a fixed period of time  usually from three to ten years  and are subject to negotiated renewal 
some program suppliers offer financial incentives to support the launch of a channel and ongoing marketing support or launch fees 
we also negotiate volume discount pricing structures 
programming costs are paid each month based on calculations performed by us and are subject to adjustment based on periodic audits performed by the programmers 
costs 
programming tends to be made available to us for a flat fee per customer with discounts available for channel placement or service penetration 
some channels are available without cost to us for a limited period of time  after which we generally must pay for the programming 
for home shopping channels  we receive a percentage of the amount spent in home shopping purchases by our customers on channels we carry 
our cable programming costs have increased  in every year we have operated  in excess of customary inflationary and cost of living type increases  and they are expected to continue to increase due to a variety of factors  including additional programming being provided to customers as a result of system rebuilds that increase channel capacity  increased cost to produce or purchase cable programming  increased cost for certain previously discounted programming  and inflationary or negotiated annual increases 
in particular  sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past several years 
in addition  contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes contain built in cost increases for programming added during the term of the contract 
historically  we have been able to offset increased programming costs through increased prices to our customers 
however  with the impact of competition and other marketplace factors  there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so 
in order to maintain margins despite increasing programming costs  we plan to continue to migrate certain program services from our analog level of service to our digital tiers 
we expect that this migration 
table of contents will result in enhanced quality of programming offered on digital tiers and provide our video customers more value and more choice 
these service migrations will likely result in an expansion in the number of our digital packages  which we believe will provide more options to bundle services and cover the increased programming expenses 
additionally  as our customers migrate to the digital tier packages  the customer base upon which we pay the increased product costs will proportionately decrease 
generally  to the extent that a reduced number of customers receive a given channel  our costs of providing that channel in our line up decreases under our programming agreements  although we may lose the benefit of certain volume discounts 
we also plan to seek to renegotiate the terms of our agreements with certain programmers as these agreements come due for renewal 
to the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable  we may be forced to remove such programming channels from our line up by the programmers  which could result in a further loss of customer relationships 
franchises as of december   our systems operated pursuant to a total of approximately  franchises  permits and similar authorizations issued by local and state governmental authorities 
each franchise is awarded by a governmental authority and such governmental authority often must approve a transfer to another party 
most franchises are subject to termination proceedings in the event of a material breach 
in addition  most franchises require us to pay the granting authority a franchise fee of up to of revenues as defined in the various agreements  which is the maximum amount that may be charged under the applicable federal law 
we are entitled to and generally do pass this fee through to the customer 
substantially all of the material franchises relating to our systems which are eligible for renewal have been renewed or extended at or prior to their stated expiration dates 
prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises  we initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities 
this process usually takes three years but can take a longer period of time 
the communications act provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals 
in connection with the franchise renewal process  many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain commitments 
historically we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring significant costs  although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise 
our failure to obtain renewals of our franchises  especially those in the major metropolitan areas where we have the most customers  would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
approximately of our franchises covering approximately of our basic cable customers expire within five years of december  under the telecom act  state and local authorities are prohibited from limiting  restricting or conditioning the provision of telecommunications services 
they may  however  impose competitively neutral requirements and manage the public rights of way 
granting authorities may not require a cable operator to provide telecommunications services or facilities  other than institutional networks  as a condition of an initial franchise grant  a franchise renewal  or a franchise transfer 
the telecom act also limits franchise fees to an operator s cable related revenues and clarifies that they do not apply to revenues that a cable operator derives from providing new telecommunications services 
in a march decision  the federal communications commission held that revenue derived from the provision of cable modem service should not be added to franchise fee payments already limited by federal law to of traditional cable service revenue 
the same decision tentatively limited local franchising authority regulation of cable modem service 
competition we face competition in the areas of price  services  and service reliability 
we compete with other providers of television signals and other sources of home entertainment 
in addition  as we continue to expand into additional services such as high speed internet access and telephony  we face competition from other providers of each type of service 
we operate in a very competitive business environment which can adversely affect our business and operations 
in terms of competition for customers  we view ourselves as a member of the broadband communications industry  which encompasses multi channel video for television and related broadband services  such as high speed data and other interactive video services 
in the broadband industry  our principal competitor for video services throughout our territory is direct broadcast satellite  and in markets where it is available  our principal competitor for data services is digital subscriber line dsl 
we do not consider other cable operators to be significant one on one competitors in the market overall  as traditional overbuilds are infrequent and spotty geographically although in a particular market  a cable operator overbuilder would likely be a significant competitor at the local level 
as of 
table of contents december   we are aware of traditional overbuild situations impacting approximately of our total customer relationships 
we are the third largest cable operator based on number of cable customers 
of the five largest cable operators with comcast corporation being first  aol time warner inc being second  cox communications  inc 
being fourth and adelphia communications corporation being fifth  charter communications  inc is the only operator whose sole business is cable related services 
although cable operators tend not to be direct competitors for customers  their relative size may affect the competitive landscape in terms of how a cable company competes against non cable competitors in the market place as well as in relationships with vendors who deal with cable operators 
for example  a larger cable operator might have better access to and pricing for the multiple types of services cable companies offer 
also  a larger entity might have different access to financial resources and acquisition opportunities 
our key competitors include dbs 
direct broadcast satellite  known as dbs  is a significant competitor to cable systems 
the dbs industry has grown rapidly over the last several years  far exceeding the growth rate of the cable television industry  and now serves more than million subscribers nationwide 
dbs service allows the subscriber to receive video and high speed internet access services directly via satellite using a relatively small dish antenna  provided the customer enables two way communication through a separate telephone connection 
consistent with increasing consolidation in the communications industry  rupert murdoch s news corp  one of the world s largest media companies  just agreed to acquire a controlling interest in directv  the largest domestic dbs company 
affiliation with news corp 
could significantly strengthen directv s competitive posture  particularly through favorable programming arrangements with various news corp 
affiliates and subsidiaries  such as the fox television network 
video compression technology and high powered satellites allow dbs providers to offer more than digital channels from a single transponder satellite  thereby surpassing the typical analog cable system 
in  major dbs competitors offered a greater variety of channel packages  and were especially competitive at the lower end pricing  such as a monthly price of approximately for channels as compared to approximately for the closest comparable package in most of our markets 
in addition  while we continue to believe that the initial investment by a dbs customer exceeds that of a cable customer  the initial equipment cost for dbs has decreased substantially  as the dbs providers have aggressively marketed offers to new customers of incentives for discounted or free equipment  installation and multiple units 
dbs providers have a national service and are able to establish a national image and branding with standardized offerings  which together with their ability to avoid franchise fees of up to of revenues  leads to greater efficiencies and lower costs in the lower tiers of service 
however  we believe that most consumers continue to prefer our stronger local presence in our markets 
we also believe that our higher tier products  particularly our bundled premium packages  are price competitive with dbs packages and that many consumers prefer our ability to economically bundle video packages with data packages  in part due to the inability of dbs providers to provide data services absent a separate telephone connection to enable two way communication 
further  cable providers have the potential in some areas to provide a more complete whole house communications package when combining video  data and telephony 
dbs companies historically were prohibited from retransmitting popular local broadcast programming 
however  a change to the copyright laws in eliminated this legal impediment 
as a result  dbs companies now may retransmit such programming  once they have secured retransmission consent from the popular broadcast stations they wish to carry  and honor mandatory carriage obligations of less popular broadcast stations in the same television markets 
in response to the legislation  directv  inc and echostar communications corporation have begun carrying the major network stations in the nation s top television markets 
dbs  however  is limited in the local programming it can provide because of the current capacity limitations of satellite technology  and the dbs companies currently offer local broadcast programming only in the larger us markets 
directv is now providing two way high speed internet access services 
another satellite company called wildblue formerly isky reports that it plans to deliver two way high speed internet access to residential and small business markets in the contiguous us and portions of canada in using the ka band and spot beam technology 
echostar  according to a recent press report  is planning to offer its video programming services with the internet services provided by earthlink  an internet service provider  using digital subscriber line technology 
dsl 
the deployment of digital subscriber line technology  known as dsl  allows internet access to subscribers at data transmission speeds greater than those available over conventional telephone lines 
dsl service therefore is competitive with high speed internet access over cable systems 
several telephone companies which already have plant  an existing customer base  and other operational functions in place such as  billing  service personnel  etc 

table of contents and other companies offer dsl service 
dsl actively markets its service and many providers have offered promotional pricing with a one year service agreement 
the federal communications commission has initiated a rulemaking proceeding that could materially reduce existing regulation of dsl service  essentially freeing such service from traditional telecommunications regulation 
it is also possible that federal legislation could reduce regulation of internet services offered by incumbent telephone companies 
legislative action and the federal communications commission s decisions and policies in this area are subject to change 
we expect dsl to remain a significant competitor to our data services 
dsl and other forms of high speed internet access provide competition to our own provision of internet access 
for example  as discussed above  satellite based delivery options are in development 
high speed internet access also facilitates the streaming of video into homes and businesses 
as the quality and availability of video streaming over the internet improves  video streaming may compete with the traditional delivery of video programming services over cable systems 
it is possible that programming suppliers will consider bypassing cable operators and market their services directly to the consumer through video streaming over the internet 
we believe that pricing for residential and commercial data services on our system is generally less than for comparable dsl services and that some residential customers prefer our ability to bundle data services with video services 
however  dsl providers may currently be in a better position to offer data services to businesses since their networks tend to be more complete in commercial areas 
they also have the ability to bundle telephony with data services for a higher percentage of their customers  and that ability is appealing to many consumers 
broadcast television 
cable television has long competed with broadcast television  which consists of television signals that the viewer is able to receive without charge using an off air antenna 
the extent of such competition is dependent upon the quality and quantity of broadcast signals available through off air reception compared to the services provided by the local cable system 
traditionally  cable television has provided a higher picture quality and more channel offerings than broadcast television 
however  the recent licensing of digital spectrum by the federal communications commission will provide traditional broadcasters with the ability to deliver high definition television pictures and multiple digital quality program streams  as well as advanced digital services such as subscription video and data transmission 
traditional overbuilds 
cable television systems are operated under non exclusive franchises granted by local authorities 
more than one cable system may legally be built in the same area 
it is possible that a franchising authority might grant a second franchise to another cable operator and that such a franchise might contain terms and conditions more favorable than those afforded us 
in addition  entities willing to establish an open video system  under which they offer unaffiliated programmers non discriminatory access to a portion of the system s cable system  may be able to avoid local franchising requirements 
well financed businesses from outside the cable industry  such as public utilities that already possess fiber optic and other transmission lines in the areas they serve  may over time become competitors 
there are a number of cities that have constructed their own cable systems  in a manner similar to city provided utility services 
there also has been interest in traditional overbuilds by private companies 
constructing a competing cable system is a capital intensive process which involves a high degree of risk 
we believe that in order to be successful  a competitor s overbuild would need to be able to serve the homes and businesses in the overbuilt area on a more cost effective basis than us 
any such overbuild operation would require either significant access to capital or access to facilities already in place that are capable of delivering cable television programming 
as of december   we are aware of overbuild situations impacting approximately of our total customer relationships  and potential overbuild situations in areas servicing approximately of our total customer relationships  together representing a total of approximately of our customer relationships 
additional overbuild situations may occur in other systems 
in response to such overbuilds  these systems have been designated priorities for the upgrade of cable plant and the launch of new and enhanced services 
as of december   we have upgraded many of these systems to at least megahertz two way hfc architecture 
telephone companies and utilities 
the competitive environment has been significantly affected by technological developments and regulatory changes enacted under the telecom act  which was designed to enhance competition in the cable television and local telephone markets 
federal cross ownership restrictions historically limited entry by local telephone companies into the cable business 
the telecom act modified this cross ownership restriction  making it possible for local exchange carriers  who have considerable resources  to provide a wide variety of video services competitive with services offered by cable systems 
although telephone companies can lawfully enter the cable television business  activity in this area is currently quite limited 
local exchange carriers do provide facilities for the transmission and distribution of voice and data 
table of contents services  including internet services  in competition with our existing or potential interactive services ventures and businesses 
we cannot predict the likelihood of success of the broadband services offered by our competitors or the impact on us of such competitive ventures 
the entry of telephone companies as direct competitors in the video marketplace may become more widespread and could adversely affect the profitability and valuation of established cable systems 
as we expand our offerings to include internet access and other telecommunications services  we will be subject to competition from other telecommunications providers 
the telecommunications industry is highly competitive and includes competitors with greater financial and personnel resources  who have brand name recognition and long standing relationships with regulatory authorities and customers 
moreover  mergers  joint ventures and alliances among franchise  wireless or private cable operators  local exchange carriers and others may result in providers capable of offering cable television  internet  and telecommunications services in direct competition with us 
additionally  we are subject to competition from utilities which possess fiber optic transmission lines capable of transmitting signals with minimal signal distortion 
private cable 
additional competition is posed by satellite master antenna television systems known as smatv systems serving multiple dwelling units  referred to in the cable industry as mdus  such as condominiums  apartment complexes  and private residential communities 
these private cable systems may enter into exclusive agreements with such mdus  which may preclude operators of franchise systems from serving residents of such private complexes 
private cable systems can offer both improved reception of local television stations and many of the same satellite delivered program services that are offered by cable systems 
smatv systems currently benefit from operating advantages not available to franchised cable systems  including fewer regulatory burdens and no requirement to service low density or economically depressed communities 
exemption from regulation may provide a competitive advantage to certain of our current and potential competitors 
the federal communications commission ruled in that private cable operators can lease video distribution capacity from local telephone companies and distribute cable programming services over public rights of way without obtaining a cable franchise 
in  both the fifth and seventh circuit courts of appeals upheld this federal communications commission policy 
wireless distribution 
cable television systems also compete with wireless program distribution services such as multi channel multipoint distribution systems or wireless cable  known as mmds 
mmds uses low power microwave frequencies to transmit television programming over the air to paying customers 
wireless distribution services generally provide many of the programming services provided by cable systems  and digital compression technology is likely to increase significantly the channel capacity of their systems 
both analog and digital mmds services require unobstructed line of sight transmission paths 
regulation and legislation the following summary addresses the key regulatory developments and legislation affecting the cable industry 
the operation of a cable system is extensively regulated by the federal communications commission  some state governments and most local governments 
the federal communications commission has the authority to enforce its regulations through the imposition of substantial fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders and or the imposition of other administrative sanctions  such as the revocation of federal communications commission licenses needed to operate certain transmission facilities used in connection with cable operations 
the telecom act altered the regulatory structure governing the nation s communications providers 
it removed barriers to competition in both the cable television market and the local telephone market 
among other things  it reduced the scope of cable rate regulation and encouraged additional competition in the video programming industry by allowing local telephone companies to provide video programming in their own telephone service areas 
the telecom act required the federal communications commission to undertake a number of implementing rulemakings 
moreover  congress and the federal communications commission have frequently revisited the subject of cable regulation 
future legislative and regulatory changes could adversely affect our operations 
cable rate regulation 
the cable act imposed an extensive rate regulation regime on the cable television industry  which limited the ability of cable companies to increase subscriber fees 
under that regime  all cable systems were subjected to rate regulation  unless they faced effective competition in their local franchise area 
federal law defines effective competition on a community specific basis as requiring satisfaction of certain conditions 
these conditions are not typically satisfied in the current marketplace  hence  most cable systems 
table of contents potentially are subject to rate regulation 
however  with the rapid growth of dbs  it is likely that additional cable systems will soon qualify for effective competition and thereby avoid further rate regulation 
although the federal communications commission established the underlying regulatory scheme  local government units  commonly referred to as local franchising authorities  are primarily responsible for administering the regulation of the lowest level of cable service the basic service tier  which typically contains local broadcast stations and public  educational  and government access channels 
before a local franchising authority begins basic service rate regulation  it must certify to the federal communications commission that it will follow applicable federal rules 
many local franchising authorities have voluntarily declined to exercise their authority to regulate basic service rates 
local franchising authorities also have primary responsibility for regulating cable equipment rates 
under federal law  charges for various types of cable equipment must be unbundled from each other and from monthly charges for programming services 
as of december   approximately of our local franchising authorities were certified to regulate basic tier rates 
because the cable act permits communities to become certified and regulate rates at any time  it is possible that additional localities served by the systems may choose to certify and regulate basic rates in the future 
for regulated cable systems  the basic service tier rate increases are governed by a complicated price cap scheme devised by the federal communications commission that allows for the recovery of inflation and certain increased costs  as well as providing some incentive for system upgrades 
operators also have the opportunity to bypass this benchmark regulatory scheme in favor of traditional cost of service regulation in cases where the latter methodology appears favorable 
cost of service regulation is a traditional form of rate regulation  under which a utility is allowed to recover its costs of providing the regulated service  plus a reasonable profit 
cable programming service tiers  which are the expanded basic programming packages that offer services other than basic programming and which typically contain satellite delivered programming  were historically rate regulated by the federal communications commission 
under the telecom act  however  the federal communications commission s authority to regulate cable programming service tier rates expired on march  the federal communications commission still adjudicates cable programming service tier complaints filed prior to that date  but strictly limits its review  and possible refund orders  to the time period prior to march  the elimination of cable programming service tier regulation affords us substantially greater pricing flexibility  subject to competitive factors and customer acceptance 
premium cable services offered on a per channel or per program basis remain unregulated under both the cable act and the telecom act 
however  federal law requires that the basic service tier be offered to all cable subscribers and limits the ability of operators to require purchase of any cable programming service tier if a customer seeks to purchase premium services offered on a per channel or per program basis 
the telecom act also relaxes existing uniform rate requirements by specifying that uniform rate requirements do not apply where the operator faces effective competition  and by exempting bulk discounts to multiple dwelling units  although complaints about predatory pricing still may be made to the federal communications commission 
cable entry into telecommunications and pole attachment rates 
the telecom act creates a more favorable environment for us to provide telecommunications services beyond traditional video delivery 
it provides that no state or local laws or regulations may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting any entity from providing any interstate or intrastate telecommunications service 
states are authorized  however  to impose competitively neutral requirements regarding universal service  public safety and welfare  service quality  and consumer protection 
state and local governments also retain their authority to manage the public rights of way and may require reasonable  competitively neutral compensation for management of the public rights of way when cable operators provide telecommunications service 
the favorable pole attachment rates afforded cable operators under federal law can be gradually increased by utility companies owning the poles if the operator provides telecommunications service  as well as cable service  over its plant 
the federal communications commission clarified that a cable operator s favorable pole rates are not endangered by the provision of internet access  and that approach ultimately was upheld by the united states supreme court 
cable entry into telecommunications will be affected by the rulings and regulations implementing the telecom act  including the rules governing interconnection 
a cable operator offering telecommunications services generally needs efficient interconnection with other telephone companies to provide a viable service 
a number of details designed to facilitate interconnection are subject to ongoing regulatory and judicial review  but the basic obligation of incumbent telephone companies to interconnect with competitors  such as cable companies offering telephone service  is well established 
even so  the economic viability of different interconnection arrangements can be greatly affected by regulatory changes 
consequently  we cannot predict whether reasonable interconnection terms will be 
table of contents available in any particular market we may choose to enter 
internet service 
over the past several years  proposals have been advanced at the federal communications commission and congress that would require cable operators to provide non discriminatory access to unaffiliated internet service providers and online service providers 
several local franchising authorities actually adopted mandatory open access requirements  but various federal courts rejected each of these actions  relying on different legal theories 
in march  the federal communications commission ruled that cable modem service that is  the provision of high speed internet access over cable system infrastructure is an interstate information service  rather than a cable or telecommunications service 
this classification should leave cable modem service exempt from the burdens associated with traditional cable and telecommunications regulation 
indeed  the federal communications commission held that revenue derived from cable modem service should not be added to franchise fee payments already limited by federal law to of traditional cable service revenue 
the federal communications commission tentatively concluded that there was no other statutory basis for local franchise authorities to assess a fee on cable modem service 
with regard to the open access question  the federal communications commission specifically held that  regardless of classification  regulatory forbearance should now apply 
as a result of this ruling we have stopped collecting franchise fees for high speed data service 
the full consequences of classifying cable modem service as an interstate information service are not yet fully known 
the federal communications commission is already considering whether providers of cable modem service should contribute to the federal government s universal service fund 
this contribution could more than offset the savings associated with excluding cable modem service from local franchise fee assessments 
the federal communications commission also initiated a rulemaking proceeding to determine whether its jurisdiction over information services still might warrant imposition of open access requirements in the future 
finally  the information services classification itself is subject to judicial review 
if regulators ultimately were allowed to impose internet access requirements on cable operators  it could burden the capacity of cable systems and complicate our own plans for providing internet service 
telephone company entry into cable television 
the telecom act allows telephone companies to compete directly with cable operators by repealing the historic telephone company cable cross ownership ban 
local exchange carriers can now compete with cable operators both inside and outside their telephone service areas with certain regulatory safeguards 
because of their resources  local exchange carriers could be formidable competitors to traditional cable operators 
various local exchange carriers already are providing video programming services within their telephone service areas through a variety of distribution methods 
under the telecom act  local exchange carriers or any other cable competitor providing video programming to subscribers through broadband wire should be regulated as a traditional cable operator  subject to local franchising and federal regulatory requirements  unless the local exchange carrier or other cable competitor elects to deploy its broadband plant as an open video system 
to qualify for favorable open video system status  the competitor must reserve two thirds of the system s activated channels for unaffiliated entities 
even then  the federal communications commission revised its open video system policy to leave franchising discretion to state and local authorities 
it is unclear what effect this ruling will have on the entities pursuing open video system operation 
although local exchange carriers and cable operators can now expand their offerings across traditional service boundaries  the general prohibition remains on local exchange carrier buyouts of cable systems serving an overlapping territory 
cable operator buyouts of overlapping local exchange carrier systems  and joint ventures between cable operators and local exchange carriers in the same market  also are prohibited 
the telecom act provides a few limited exceptions to this buyout prohibition  including a carefully circumscribed rural exemption 
the telecom act also provides the federal communications commission with the limited authority to grant waivers of the buyout prohibition 
electric utility entry into telecommunications cable television 
the telecom act provides that registered utility holding companies and subsidiaries may provide telecommunications services  including cable television  notwithstanding the public utility holding company act of electric utilities must establish separate subsidiaries  known as exempt telecommunications companies and must apply to the federal communications commission for operating authority 
like telephone companies  electric utilities have substantial resources at their disposal  and could be formidable competitors to traditional cable systems 
several such utilities have been granted broad authority by the federal communications commission to engage in activities which could include the provision of video programming 

table of contents additional ownership restrictions 
the telecom act eliminated a statutory restriction on broadcast network cable cross ownership  but left in place existing federal communications commission regulations prohibiting local cross ownership between co located television stations and cable systems 
the district of columbia circuit court of appeals subsequently struck down this remaining broadcast cable cross ownership prohibition  and the federal communications commission has now eliminated the prohibition 
pursuant to the cable act  the federal communications commission adopted rules precluding a cable system from devoting more than of its activated channel capacity to the carriage of affiliated national video program services 
also pursuant to the cable act  the federal communications commission adopted rules that preclude any cable operator from serving more than of all us domestic multichannel video subscribers  including cable and direct broadcast satellite subscribers 
the dc circuit court of appeals struck down these vertical and horizontal ownership limits as unconstitutional  concluding that the federal communications commission had not adequately justified the specific rules ie  the and figures adopted 
the federal communications commission is now considering replacement regulations 
must carry retransmission consent 
the cable act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements 
broadcast signal carriage is the transmission of broadcast television signals over a cable system to cable customers 
these requirements  among other things  allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years between must carry status or retransmission consent status 
less popular stations typically elect must carry  which is the broadcast signal carriage rule that allows local commercial television broadcast stations to require a cable system to carry the station 
more popular stations  such as those affiliated with a national network  typically elect retransmission consent which is the broadcast signal carriage rule that allows local commercial television broadcast stations to negotiate for payments for granting permission to the cable operator to carry the stations 
must carry requests can dilute the appeal of a cable system s programming offerings because a cable system with limited channel capacity may be required to forego carriage of popular channels in favor of less popular broadcast stations electing must carry 
retransmission consent demands may require substantial payments or other concessions 
either option has a potentially adverse effect on our business 
the burden associated with must carry may increase substantially if broadcasters proceed with planned conversion to digital transmission and the federal communications commission determines that cable systems simultaneously must carry all analog and digital broadcasts in their entirety 
this burden would reduce capacity available for more popular video programming and new internet and telecommunication offerings 
the federal communications commission tentatively decided against imposition of dual digital and analog must carry in a january ruling 
at the same time  however  it initiated further fact gathering which ultimately could lead to a reconsideration of the tentative conclusion 
the federal communications commission is also considering whether it should maintain its initial ruling that  whenever a digital broadcast signal does become eligible for must carry  a cable operator s obligation is limited to carriage of a single digital video signal 
if the commission reverses itself  and cable operators are required to carry ancillary digital feeds  the burden associated with digital must carry could be significantly increased 
access channels 
local franchising authorities can include franchise provisions requiring cable operators to set aside certain channels for public  educational and governmental access programming 
federal law also requires cable systems to designate a portion of their channel capacity  up to in some cases  for commercial leased access by unaffiliated third parties 
the federal communications commission has adopted rules regulating the terms  conditions and maximum rates a cable operator may charge for commercial leased access use 
we believe that requests for commercial leased access carriages have been relatively limited 
the federal communications commission rejected a request that unaffiliated internet service providers be found eligible for commercial leased access 
access to programming 
to spur the development of independent cable programmers and competition to incumbent cable operators  the cable act imposed restrictions on the dealings between cable operators and cable programmers 
of special significance from a competitive business position  the cable act precludes video programmers affiliated with cable companies from favoring cable operators over new competitors and requires such programmers to sell their satellite delivered programming to other multichannel video distributors 
this provision limits the ability of vertically integrated cable programmers to offer exclusive programming arrangements to cable companies 
the federal communications commission recently extended this exclusivity prohibition to october dbs providers have no similar restrictions on exclusive programming contracts 
pursuant to the satellite home viewer improvement act  the federal communications commission has adopted regulations governing retransmission consent negotiations between broadcasters and all multichannel video programming distributors  including cable and dbs 
inside wiring  subscriber access 
in an order dating back to and largely upheld in a reconsideration order  the federal communications commission established rules that require an incumbent cable operator upon 
table of contents expiration of a multiple dwelling unit service contract to sell  abandon  or remove home run wiring that was installed by the cable operator in a multiple dwelling unit building 
these inside wiring rules are expected to assist building owners in their attempts to replace existing cable operators with new programming providers who are willing to pay the building owner a higher fee  where such a fee is permissible 
in another proceeding  the federal communications commission has preempted restrictions on the deployment of private antennae on property within the exclusive use of a condominium owner or tenant  such as balconies and patios 
this federal communications commission ruling may limit the extent to which we along with multiple dwelling unit owners may enforce certain aspects of multiple dwelling unit agreements which otherwise prohibit  for example  placement of digital broadcast satellite receiver antennae in multiple dwelling unit areas under the exclusive occupancy of a renter 
these developments may make it even more difficult for us to provide service in multiple dwelling unit complexes 
other communications act provisions and regulations of the federal communications commission 
in addition to the communications act provisions and federal communications commission regulations noted above  there are other statutory provisions and regulations of the federal communications commission covering such areas as subscriber privacy  programming practices  including  among other things  blackouts of programming offered by a distant broadcast signal carried on a cable system which duplicates the programming for which a local broadcast station has secured exclusive distribution rights  local sports blackouts  indecent programming  lottery programming  political programming  sponsorship identification  children s programming advertisements  and closed captioning  registration of cable systems and facilities licensing  maintenance of various records and public inspection files  aeronautical frequency usage  lockbox availability  antenna structure notification  tower marking and lighting  consumer protection and customer service standards  technical standards  equal employment opportunity  consumer electronics equipment compatibility  and emergency alert systems 
the federal communications commission ruled that cable customers must be allowed to purchase set top terminals from third parties and established a multi year phase in during which security functions which would remain in the operator s exclusive control would be unbundled from basic converter functions  which could then be provided by third party vendors 
the first phase implementation date was july  as of january   cable operators will be prohibited from placing in service new set top terminals that integrate security functions and basic converter navigation functions 
the fcc is currently conducting a rulemaking in which it is considering adopting rules to help implement a recent agreement between major cable operators and manufacturers of consumer electronics on plug and play digital televisions 
the proposed rules would require cable operators to provide point of deployment security modules and support to customer owned digital televisions and similar devices already equipped with built in set top box functionality 
the rules would also permit the offering of digital programming with certain copy controls built into the programming  subject to limitations on the use of those copy controls 
these proposed restrictions  if adopted as proposed  would apply equally to cable operators and to other mvpds  such as dbs 

table of contents additional regulatory policies may be added in the future 
the federal communications commission has initiated an inquiry to determine whether the cable industry s future provision of interactive services should be subject to regulations ensuring equal access and competition among service vendors 
the inquiry  which grew out of the commission s review of the aol time warner merger is yet another expression of regulatory concern regarding control over cable capacity 
copyright 
cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals 
in exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system  the number of distant broadcast television signals carried  and the location of the cable system  cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals 
the possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review and could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming 
we cannot predict the outcome of this legislative activity 
copyright clearances for nonbroadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations 
cable operators distribute locally originated programming and advertising that use music controlled by the two principal major music performing rights organizations  the american society of composers  authors and publishers and broadcast music  inc the cable industry has had a long series of negotiations and adjudications with both organizations 
although we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these industry proceedings or the amount of any license fees we may be required to pay for past and future use of association controlled music  we do not believe such license fees will be significant to our business and operations 
state and local regulation 
cable systems generally are operated pursuant to nonexclusive franchises granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity in order to cross public rights of way 
federal law now prohibits local franchising authorities from granting exclusive franchises or from unreasonably refusing to award additional franchises 
cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for non compliance and may be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions 
the specific terms and conditions of franchises vary materially between jurisdictions 
each franchise generally contains provisions governing cable operations  franchising fees  system construction and maintenance obligations  system channel capacity  design and technical performance  customer service standards  and indemnification protections 
a number of states  including connecticut  subject cable systems to the jurisdiction of centralized state governmental agencies  some of which impose regulation of a character similar to that of a public utility 
although local franchising authorities have considerable discretion in establishing franchise terms  there are certain federal limitations 
for example  local franchising authorities cannot insist on franchise fees exceeding of the system s gross cable related revenues  cannot dictate the particular technology used by the system  and cannot specify video programming other than identifying broad categories of programming 
certain states are considering the imposition of new broadly applied telecommunications taxes 
federal law contains renewal procedures designed to protect incumbent franchisees against arbitrary denials of renewal 
even if a franchise is renewed  the local franchising authority may seek to impose new and more onerous requirements such as significant improvements in service or increased franchise fees as a condition of renewal 
similarly  if a local franchising authority s consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system or franchise  the local franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome or onerous franchise requirements as a condition for providing its consent 
historically  most franchises have been renewed for and consents granted to cable operators that have provided satisfactory services and have complied with the terms of their franchise 
under the telecom act  states and local franchising authorities are prohibited from limiting  restricting  or conditioning the provision of competitive telecommunications services  except for certain competitively neutral requirements and as necessary to manage the public rights of way 
this law should facilitate entry into competitive telecommunications services  although certain jurisdictions still may attempt to impose rigorous entry requirements 
in addition  local franchising authorities may not require a cable operator to provide any telecommunications service or facilities  other than institutional networks under certain circumstances  as a condition of an initial franchise grant  a franchise renewal  or a franchise transfer 
the telecom act also provides that franchising fees are limited to an operator s cable related revenues and do not apply to revenues that a cable operator derives from providing new telecommunications services 
in a march decision  the federal communications commission tentatively held that a cable operator s provision of internet access service should not subject the operator to additional franchising requirements 
that decision is currently under appeal to federal court
