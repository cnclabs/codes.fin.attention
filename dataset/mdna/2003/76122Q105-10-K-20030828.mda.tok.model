we earn revenue primarily by charging our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our associates 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and typically invoice our clients on a weekly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires an associate onto its permanent payroll 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process and represented less than  and of our revenue for the years ended may   and  respectively 
we periodically review our outstanding accounts receivable balance and determine an estimate of the amount of those receivables we believe may prove uncollectible 
our provision for bad debts is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the costs to pay our professional associates and all related benefit and incentive costs  including provisions for paid time off and other employee benefits  are included in direct cost of services 
we pay our associates on an hourly basis for all hours worked on client engagements and  therefore  direct cost of services tends to vary directly with the volume of revenue we earn 
we expense the benefits we pay to our associates as they are earned 
these benefits include paid vacation and holidays  a bonus incentive plan  referral bonus programs  group health  dental and life insurance programs  a matching k retirement plan  the ability to participate in the company s employee stock purchase plan  and professional development and career training

for convenience  all references herein to years or periods are to years or periods ended may critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
under the new accounting standard effective june   our goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer subject to periodic amortization over their estimated useful lives 
these assets are now considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values  our operating performance and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments for services rendered 
we estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients  review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
if the financial condition of our clients deteriorates or we note an unfavorable trend in aggregate receivable collections  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates of income taxes  if applicable  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of any current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we will establish a valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in recording additional tax expense 
if the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the consolidated statements of income  additional tax expense may need to be recorded 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of income data 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results

resources connection  inc year ended may  year ended may  year ended may  revenue direct cost of services gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangible assets depreciation expense income from operations interest expense income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended may  compared to year ended may  revenue 
revenue increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  growth in revenues resulted primarily from continued expansion of our scope of services resulting in more billable hours for our associates and an improvement in rate per hour 
our scope of services expanded by increasing marketing awareness of our ability to do information technology  human capital and internal audit related engagements 
we also added tpc operations 
these measures partially offset the effects of the negative economy 
to a lesser extent  revenue benefited from the fifty third week of activity in fiscal overall bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue for the year is also reflected by the increase in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal we operated offices during the final quarter of fiscal  compared to offices in the last quarter of fiscal direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the previously described expansion of the scope of services resulting in more chargeable hours for our associates at higher average pay rates 
overall  the average pay rate per hour increased by year over year 
the number of associates on assignment increased from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal the direct cost of services increased as a percentage of revenue from for fiscal year to for fiscal year the net increase primarily reflects the incremental increase in pay rate per hour compared to bill rate per hour and the decrease in conversion fees in the current year compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in management and administrative headcount from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal  causing an increase in compensation and related benefits expense 
the increase in headcount arose from the addition of internal personnel of tpc  the incremental hiring for the seven additional offices opened during fiscal  as well as the full year of operation for those offices opened in fiscal the company also continued throughout fiscal the advertising campaign in targeted business publications begun in the fourth quarter of fiscal the increase was also attributable to an increase in occupancy costs from the addition of the new offices  an increase in bonus expense from the company s improved revenue results and an increase in insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  this percentage increase resulted from the aforementioned increase in salary expense and related benefits  occupancy expenses and national advertising expenses 
amortization and depreciation expenses 
amortization of intangible assets increased from  for the year ended may  to  for the year ended may  the increase is attributable to the amortization of intangible assets in the current year related to the company s acquisition of tpc  as well as the purchase of a united kingdom uk practice in fiscal the company recognized approximately  in amortization expense on non compete agreements and candidate  prospect and client databases related to the tpc acquisition and  related to the uk practice 
in the prior year  amortization expense related only to the amortization of the non compete agreement entered into when the company acquired resources connection llc llc on april  the balance of  remaining for that non compete agreement at the end of fiscal was fully amortized in fiscal depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  this increase reflects the investment in our uk offices as well as the tpc acquisition  the other offices opened since the beginning of fiscal  a full year of depreciation of assets acquired during fiscal and our investment in information technology 
interest income 
the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
as of may   the company has million of government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds mature through and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
during fiscal  the company generated interest income of million compared to interest income of million in the year ended may  although the average cash balance for investment increased from fiscal to fiscal  the lower interest rates year over year more than offset the cash balance increase 
the company earned approximately  annualized  on its money market  commercial paper and other marketable securities investments during the year 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  due to the decrease in income from operations in fiscal the decrease in income from operations was offset by the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal to from approximately in fiscal the increase is primarily due to an increase in the federal statutory rate of  which resulted from applying a federal tax rate in fiscal as opposed to a tax rate as in prior years 
periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the provision 
the company is implementing tax planning strategies aimed at reducing its tax burden 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate will not increase in the future 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  revenue 
revenue decreased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the decrease in revenues resulted from the decline in the total billable hours charged to our clients as compared to the prior year  reflected in the decrease in the number of associates on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal the decrease in billable hours is primarily attributable to the impact of the recession on our clients  as clients opted to truncate certain assignments as compared to the prior year and have taken greater amounts of time to begin follow on projects 
the decrease is also attributable to the loss of middle market clients served during fiscal and the truncation of services by other middle market clients during fiscal the decrease in total revenue was offset by an increase in the proportion of hours generated by associates in the it service line with a higher average billing rate per hour and a increase in the overall average billing rate per hour 
we operated offices during the final quarter of fiscal  compared to offices in the last quarter of fiscal direct cost of services 
direct cost of services decreased million or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the decrease in direct cost of services was attributable to the decrease in total billable hours charged to our clients as compared to the prior year 
the number of associates on assignment declined from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal the decrease in direct cost of services occurred despite a increase in the average pay rate per hour between the two years 
direct cost of services increased as a percentage of revenue from for fiscal year to for fiscal year the net increase reflects the incremental increase in billing rate per hour compared to pay rate per hour  offset by the impact of our enriched benefit programs for associates and the decrease in conversion fees in the current year compared to the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  this increase reflects the cost of operating and staffing the three new offices opened during fiscal as well as a full year of operation for those offices opened in fiscal management and administrative headcount increased from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal  causing an increase in compensation and related benefits expense 
the company also embarked in the fourth quarter of fiscal on an advertising campaign in targeted business publications 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  this percentage increase resulted primarily from the lower revenue base in fiscal over which to spread selling  general and administrative expenses  including fixed operating costs  such as rent expense 
amortization and depreciation expenses 
amortization of intangible assets decreased from million for the year ended may  to  for the year ended may  effective june   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes new standards for goodwill acquired in a business combination and other intangible assets  eliminates amortization of existing goodwill balances  and requires annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the company is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment by determining the individual reporting units giving rise to the existing goodwill  allocating a fair value to each of the individual reporting units via such measures as market capitalization and analysis of future cash flows  and comparing such fair value amounts to the carrying values of the reporting units 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
the company does not believe that an impairment of goodwill has occurred 
the amortization expense in the current year is related to the amortization of the remaining balance paid for a non compete agreement entered into when the company acquired llc 
depreciation expense increased from  for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  this increase reflects the addition of offices since the prior year  a full year of depreciation of assets acquired during fiscal and our investment in information technology 
interest income expense  net 
the repayment of the term loan and subordinated notes on december   effectively ended the company s interest expense obligations 
the company has invested available cash in money market and commercial paper investments that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
during fiscal  the company purchased million of government agency bonds with remaining maturity dates in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
the bonds mature through may and have coupon rates ranging from to 
these investments have been classified in the may  consolidated balance sheet as held to maturity securities 
during fiscal  the company generated interest income of million compared to net interest expense of million in the year ended may  the company earned approximately  annualized  on its money market  commercial paper and other marketable securities investments during the year 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  due to the decrease in income from operations in fiscal the effective tax rate was approximately for both years  which differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes  net of federal benefit 
periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the provision 
there can be no assurance that the company s effective tax rate will not increase in the future 
quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of income data for each of the eight quarters in the two year period ended may  in the opinion of management  this data has been prepared on a basis substantially consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document  and reflect and include all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the data 
the quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this document

our quarterly results have fluctuated in the past and we believe they will continue to do so in the future 
certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described below in the section of this report entitled risks related to our business 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by our operations and  to the extent necessary  available commitments under our revolving line of credit 
we have generated positive cash flows from operations since inception  and we continued to do so during the year ended may  at may   the company had operating leases  primarily for office premises  expiring at various dates 
at may   the company had no capital leases 
future minimum rental commitments under operating leases are as follows years ending may thereafter total on august   we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows the company to choose the interest rate applicable to advances 
the interest rate options are bank of america s prime rate  a london inter bank offered libor rate plus or bank of america s grand cayman banking center ibor rate plus 
interest is payable on the credit agreement at various intervals no less frequently than quarterly 
there is an annual facility fee of payable on the unutilized portion of the credit agreement 
the credit agreement  originally set to expire on september   has been extended to december  and the company is negotiating to extend the agreement for an additional two years 
as of may   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operations resulted primarily from the net earnings of the company partially offset by growth in working capital 
one of the primary components of the net increase in cash provided by operations was the increase in the accrual for management incentive bonus as well as the profit sharing plan for associates as of may  compared to may   as the company s revenue increased 
in addition  accruals for salaries were up over as of may  compared to may  this was the result of two weeks of accrued salary owed to associates as of may  compared to one week at the end of may  and  to a lesser extent  the higher number of associates on active assignment at the end of fiscal compared to fiscal in the current year  the company was also able to utilize some of the prepayments of income taxes triggered by the company s change in tax year end from december to may in calendar these favorable operating cash flow activities were offset by the increase in the company s accounts receivable balance in fiscal  triggered by the company s higher revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal the company s had million in cash and cash equivalents and million of long term marketable securities at may net cash used in investing activities totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  the company purchased million of marketable securities and classified them as held to maturity securities since their remaining maturity dates are in excess of one year from the balance sheet date 
these securities have coupon interest rates ranging from to as of may  subsequent to may   the company completed three separate acquisitions using a total of million in cash 
after these transactions and anticipated sources and uses of cash during the quarter  the company expects cash balances available for operating purposes to exceed million as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal net cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended may  compared to million for the year ended may  the net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal reflects the net proceeds received from our secondary offering of common stock in addition to stock option exercises and purchases by employees through the company s employee stock purchase plan 
there was no secondary offering of common stock and the volume of stock option exercises declined in fiscal our ongoing operations and anticipated growth in the geographic markets we currently serve will require us to continue to make investments in capital equipment  primarily technology hardware and software 
in addition  we may consider making additional strategic acquisitions 
we anticipate that our current cash  existing availability under our revolving line of credit and the ongoing cash flows from our operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  either internally or through acquisition  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure additional debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or the addition of new debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be compelled to delay or curtail our plans to develop our business  which could have a material adverse affect on our operations  market position and competitiveness

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making a decision to buy shares of our common stock 
the order of the risks is not an indication of their relative weight or importance 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those risks set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  may also adversely impact and impair our business 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business could be harmed 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
when determining whether to buy our common stock  you should also refer to the other information in this report on form k  including our financial statements and the related notes 
this report on form k contains forward looking statements based on the current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about our industry and us 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described in this section and elsewhere in this report on form k 
we do not undertake to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
we must provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced associates  and the loss of a significant number of our associates  or an inability to attract and retain new associates  could adversely affect our business and operating results 
our business involves the delivery of professional services  and our success depends on our ability to provide our clients with highly qualified and experienced associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to satisfy their needs 
such professionals are in great demand  particularly in certain geographic areas  and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
our ability to attract and retain associates with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including  but not limited to  our ability to provide our associates with full time employment  obtain the type of challenging and high quality projects that our associates seek  pay competitive compensation and provide competitive benefits  and provide our associates with flexibility as to hours worked and assignment of client engagements 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in accomplishing each of these items and  even if we are  that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the number of highly qualified and experienced associates necessary to maintain and grow our business 
the market for professional services is highly competitive  and if we are unable to compete effectively against our competitors our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we operate in a competitive  fragmented market  and we compete for clients and associates with a variety of organizations that offer similar services 
the competition is likely to increase in the future due to the expected growth of the market and the relatively few barriers to entry 
our principal competitors include consulting firms  employees loaned by the big four accounting firms  traditional and internet based staffing firms  and the in house resources of our clients 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete effectively against existing or future competitors 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources  greater revenues and greater name recognition  which may afford them an advantage in attracting and retaining clients and associates 
in addition  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to changes in companies needs and developments in the professional services industry 
an economic downturn or change in the use of outsourced professional services associates may adversely affect our business 
the us economy has experienced an economic downturn and our business has been significantly affected by the economic downturn 
during a general level of economic slowing  our clients have delayed or cancelled plans that involve professional services  particularly outsourced professional services 
consequently  the demand for our associates has declined  resulting in a loss of revenues 
in addition  the use of professional services associates on a project basis could decline for non economic reasons 
in the event of a non economic reduction in the demand for our associates  our financial results could suffer 
our business depends upon our ability to secure new projects from clients and  therefore  we could be adversely affected if we fail to do so 
we do not have long term agreements with our clients for the provision of services 
the success of our business is dependent on our ability to secure new projects from clients 
for example  if we are unable to secure new client projects because of improvements in our competitors service offerings or because of an economic downturn decreasing the demand for outsourced professional services  our business is likely to be materially adversely affected 
we may be legally liable for damages resulting from the performance of projects by our associates or for our clients mistreatment of our associates 
many of our engagements with our clients involve projects that are critical to our clients businesses 
if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability or damage to our reputation  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
it is likely  because of the nature of our business  that we will be sued in the future 
claims brought against us could have a serious negative effect on our reputation and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
because we are in the business of placing our associates in the workplaces of other companies  we are subject to possible claims by our associates alleging discrimination  sexual harassment  negligence and other similar activities by our clients 
we may also be subject to similar claims from our clients based on activities by our associates 
the cost of defending such claims  even if groundless  could be substantial and the associated negative publicity could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain associates and clients 
we may not be able to grow our business  manage our growth or sustain our current business 
we grew rapidly from our inception in until by opening new offices and by increasing the volume of services we provide through existing offices 
in  our revenue declined by 
although revenue has increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal by  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or expand our market presence in our current locations or to successfully enter other markets or locations 
our ability to successfully grow our business will depend upon a number of factors  including our ability to grow our client base  expand profitably into new cities  provide additional professional services lines  maintain margins in the face of pricing pressures  and manage costs 
even if we are able to continue our growth  the growth will result in new and increased responsibilities for our management as well as increased demands on our internal systems  procedures and controls  and our administrative  financial  marketing and other resources 
failure to adequately respond to these new responsibilities and demands may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
the increase in our international activities will expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face 
as we increase our international activities  we will have to confront and manage a number of risks and expenses that we would not otherwise face if we conducted our operations solely in the united states 
if any of these risks or expenses occurs  there could be a material negative effect on our operating results 
these risks and expenses include difficulties in staffing and managing foreign offices as a result of  among other things  distance  language and cultural differences  expenses associated with customizing our professional services for clients in foreign countries  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  when we sell our professional services in denominations other than us dollars  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local companies  political and economic instability in some international markets  multiple  conflicting and changing government laws and regulations  trade barriers  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we have acquired  and may continue to acquire companies in the future  and these acquisitions could disrupt our business 
we may acquire companies in the future 
entering into an acquisition entails many risks  any of which could harm our business  including diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  failure to integrate the acquired company with our existing business  failure to motivate  or loss of  key employees from either our existing business or the acquired business  potential impairment of relationships with our employees and clients  additional operating expenses not offset by additional revenue  incurrence of significant non recurring charges  incurrence of additional debt with restrictive covenants or other limitations  dilution of our stock as a result of issuing equity securities  and assumption of liabilities of the acquired company 
our business could suffer if we lose the services of one or more key members of our management 
our future success depends upon the continued employment of donald b 
murray  our chief executive officer  and stephen j 
giusto  our chief financial officer 
the departure of mr 
murray  mr 
giusto or any of the other key members of our senior management team could significantly disrupt our operations 
key members of our senior management team include karen m 
ferguson  an executive vice president  john d 
bower  our vice president  finance  and kate w 
duchene  our chief legal officer and executive vice president of human relations 
we do not have employment agreements with mr 
bower or ms 
duchene 
our quarterly financial results may be subject to significant fluctuations that may increase the volatility of our stock price 
our results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include our ability to attract new clients and retain current clients  the mix of client projects  the announcement or introduction of new services by us or any of our competitors  the expansion of the professional services offered by us or any of our competitors into new locations both nationally and internationally  changes in the demand for our services by our clients  the entry of new competitors into any of our markets  the number of associates eligible for our offered benefits as the average length of employment with resources increases  the number of holidays in a quarter  particularly the day of the week on which they occur  changes in the pricing of our professional services or those of our competitors  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to management and expansion of our business  the timing of acquisitions and related costs  such as compensation charges that fluctuate based on the market price of our common stock  and the periodic fourth quarter consisting of weeks 
due to these factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock could decline 
we may be subject to laws and regulations that impose difficult and costly compliance requirements and subject us to potential liability and the loss of clients 
in connection with providing services to clients in certain regulated industries  such as the gaming and energy industries  we are subject to industry specific regulations  including licensing and reporting requirements 
complying with these requirements is costly and  if we fail to comply  we could be prevented from rendering services to clients in those industries in the future 
it may be difficult for a third party to acquire our company  and this could depress our stock price 
delaware corporate law and our second restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay  defer or prevent a change of control of our company or our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
as a result  these provisions could limit the price that future investors are willing to pay for your shares 
these provisions authorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of undesignated preferred stock  the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance  divide our board of directors into three classes of directors  with each class serving a staggered three year term 
because the classification of the board of directors generally increases the difficulty of replacing a majority of the directors  it may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us and may make it difficult to change the composition of the board of directors  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors which  if not prohibited  could allow a minority stockholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares to ensure the election of one or more directors  require that any action required or permitted to be taken by our stockholders must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and may not be effected by any consent in writing  state that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors  our chief executive officer  by the board of directors after a resolution is adopted by a majority of the total number of authorized directors  or by the holders of not less than of our outstanding voting stock  establish advance notice requirements for submitting nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting  provide that certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation can be amended only by supermajority vote of the outstanding shares and that our bylaws can be amended only by supermajority vote of the outstanding shares of our board of directors  allow our directors  not our stockholders  to fill vacancies on our board of directors  and provide that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of the board of directors 
the company s board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan  which is described further in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k 
the existence of this rights plan may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of our company or our management by deterring acquisitions of our stock not approved by our board of directors 
we may be unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  including our brand name 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  the value of such rights may diminish and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we believe that establishing  maintaining and enhancing the resources connection brand name is essential to our business 
we have obtained us registrations on our service mark and logo  registration no 
 registered december   and no 
 registered january  and no 
 registered september  we have been aware from time to time of other companies using the name resources connection or some variation thereof 
there could be potential trade name or service mark infringement claims brought against us by the users of these similar names and marks and those users may have service mark rights that are senior to ours 
if these claims were successful  we could be forced to cease using the service mark resources connection even if an infringement claim is not brought against us 
it is also possible that our competitors or others will adopt service names similar to ours or that our clients will be confused by another company using a name  service mark or trademark similar to ours  thereby impeding our ability to build brand identity 
we cannot assure you that our business would not be adversely affected if confusion did occur or if we are required to change our name 
our clients may be confused by the presence of competitors and other companies that have names similar to our name 
we are aware of other companies using the name resources connection or some variation thereof 
the existence of these companies may confuse our clients  thereby impeding our ability to build our brand identity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of cash  highly liquid short term investments and long term marketable securities 
these investments are subject to changes in interest rates  and to the extent interest rates were to decline  it would reduce our interest income 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to date  our foreign operations have not been significant to our overall operations  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk has been low 
however  as our strategy to continue expanding foreign operations progresses  and with our recent acquisitions discussed elsewhere in this document  we expect more of our revenues will be derived from foreign operations denominated in the currency of the applicable markets 
as a result  our operating results could become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
although we intend to monitor our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  including the use of financial hedging techniques when we deem it appropriate  we cannot assure you that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
