sales and marketing central parking s sales and marketing efforts are designed to expand its operations by developing and maintaining relationships with major real estate developers and asset managers  business and government leaders  and other clients 
central parking encourages its managers to pursue new opportunities at the local level while selectively targeting key clients and projects at a national level 
local at the local level  central parking s sales and marketing efforts are decentralized and directed towards identifying new expansion opportunities within a particular city or region 
managers are trained to develop the business contacts necessary to generate new opportunities and to monitor their local markets for take away and outsourcing opportunities 
central parking provides its managers with a significant degree of autonomy in order to encourage prompt and effective responses to local market demands  which is complemented by management support and marketing training through central parking s corporate offices 
by developing business contacts locally  central parking s managers often get the opportunity to bid on projects when asset managers and property owners are dissatisfied with current operations and also learn in advance of possible new projects 
national at the national level  central parking s marketing efforts are undertaken primarily by upper level management  which targets developers  governmental entities  the hospitality industry  mixed use projects  and medical facilities 
these efforts are directed at operations that generally have national name recognition  substantial demand for parking related services  and the potential for nationwide growth 
for example  central parking s current clients include  among other national real estate companies and hotel chains  the rouse company  millennium partners  faison associates  shorenstein  may department stores  crescent real estate  trizec office properties  jones lang lasalle  westin hotels  ritz carlton hotels and hyatt hotels 
management believes that providing high quality  efficient services to such companies can lead to additional opportunities as those clients expand their operations 
management believes outsourcing by parking facility owners will continue to be a source for additional facilities  and management believes the company s global presence  experience and reputation with large real estate asset managers give it a competitive advantage in this area 
international central parking s international operations began in the early s with the formation of an international division 
the company typically enters foreign markets either through consulting projects or by forming joint ventures with established local entities 
consulting projects allow central parking to establish a presence and evaluate the prospects for growth of a given market without investing a significant amount of capital 
likewise  forming joint ventures with local partners allows central parking to enter new foreign markets with reduced operating and investment risks 
operations in london began in with a single consulting agreement and  as of september   had grown to locations in the united kingdom including four airports  eight rail operating companies and parking meter enforcement and ticketing services for thirteen local governments that have privatized these services 
central parking began expansion into mexico in july by forming a joint venture with fondo opcion  an established mexican developer  and as of september   operated facilities in mexico 
as of september   central parking also operated facilities in canada  facilities in spain  in poland  in chile  in venezuela  in colombia  in peru  in switzerland  and in greece 
the company also operates on street parking services in the united kingdom  germany and the republic of ireland 
in  central parking acquired a page of 
table of contents equity interest in a joint venture  which operated facilities in germany as of september  to manage its international expansion efforts  the company has allocated responsibilities for international operations to the president of international operations 
operating arrangements central parking operates parking facilities under three general types of arrangements management contracts  leases  and fee ownership 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the number of managed  leased  or owned facilities as of the specified dates september  managed leased owned total the general terms and benefits of these types of arrangements are discussed below 
financial information regarding these types of arrangements is set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management contracts management contract revenues consist of management fees both fixed and performance based and fees for ancillary services such as insurance  accounting  benefits administration  equipment leasing  and consulting 
the cost of management contracts includes insurance premiums and claims and other indirect overhead 
the company s responsibilities under a management contract as a facility manager generally include hiring  training  and staffing parking personnel  and providing collections  accounting  record keeping and insurance 
most management contracts provide that the company is reimbursed for out of pocket expenses 
central parking is not responsible under most of its management contracts for structural  mechanical  or electrical maintenance or repairs  or for providing security or guard services or for paying property taxes 
in general  management contracts are for terms of one to three years and are renewable for successive one year terms  but are typically cancelable by the property owner on days notice 
with respect to insurance  the company s clients have the option of obtaining liability insurance on their own or having central parking provide insurance as part of the services provided under the management contract 
because of the company s size and claims experience  management believes it can purchase such insurance at lower rates than the company s clients can generally obtain on their own 
leases the company s leases generally require the payment of a fixed amount of rent  regardless of the amount of revenues or profitability generated by the parking facility 
in addition  many leases also require the payment of a percentage of gross revenues above specified threshold levels 
in general  leased facilities require a longer commitment  a larger capital investment for the company  and represent a greater risk than managed facilities due to the relatively fixed nature of expenses 
however  leased facilities also provide a greater opportunity for long term growth in revenues and profits 
the cost of parking includes rent  payroll and related benefits  depreciation  maintenance  insurance  and general operating expenses 
under its leases  the company is typically responsible for all facets of the parking operations  including pricing  utilities  and routine maintenance 
in short to medium term leases  the company is generally not responsible for structural  mechanical or electrical maintenance or repairs  or property taxes 
however  the company does often have these responsibilities in longer term leases 
lease arrangements are typically for terms of three to twenty years  and generally provide for increases in base rent that are either pre determined or based on indices  such as the consumer price index 
fee ownership ownership of parking facilities  either independently or through joint ventures  typically requires a larger capital investment and greater risk than managed or leased facilities  but provides maximum control over the operation of the parking facility and the greatest profit potential of the three types of operating arrangements 
all owned facility revenues flow directly to the company  and the company has the potential to realize benefits of appreciation in the value of the underlying real estate if the property is sold 
the ownership of a parking facility brings the company complete responsibility for all aspects of the property  including all structural  mechanical or electrical maintenance or repairs and property taxes 
joint ventures the company seeks joint venture partners who are established local or regional developers pursuing financing alternatives for development projects 
joint ventures typically involve a interest in a development where the parking facility is a part of a larger multi use project  allowing the company s joint venture partners to benefit from a capital infusion to the project 
joint ventures page of 
table of contents offer the revenue growth potential of ownership with a partial reduction in capital requirements 
the company has interests in joint ventures that own or operate parking facilities located in the united states as well as mexico  germany  poland  greece  venezuela  colombia and peru 
dbe partnerships central parking is a party to a number of disadvantaged business enterprise partnerships 
these are generally partnerships formed by central parking and a disadvantaged business person to manage a facility 
central parking generally owns to of the partnership interests in each partnership and typically receives management fees before partnership distributions are made to the partners 
competition the parking industry is fragmented and highly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry 
the company competes with a variety of other companies to manage  lease and own parking facilities  and faces competition for customers and employees to operate parking facilities 
although there are relatively few large  national parking companies that compete with the company  numerous companies  including real estate developers  hotel and property management companies  and national financial services companies either compete currently or have the potential to compete with parking companies 
municipalities and other governmental entities also operate parking facilities that compete with central parking in some cities 
in addition  the company faces competition from numerous regional and local parking companies and from owner operators of facilities who are potential clients for the company s management services 
construction of new parking facilities near the company s existing facilities increases the competition for customers and employees and can adversely affect the company s business 
management believes that it competes for management clients based on a variety of factors  including fees charged for services  ability to generate revenues and control expenses for clients  accurate and timely reporting of operational results  quality of customer service  and ability to anticipate and respond to industry changes 
factors that affect the company s ability to compete for leased and owned locations include the ability to make capital investments  pre paid rent payments and other financial commitments  long term financial stability  and the ability to generate revenues and control expenses 
the company competes for parking customers based primarily on rates charged for parking  convenience location of the facility  and quality of customer service 
factors affecting the company s ability to compete for employees include wages  benefits and working conditions 
seasonality the company s business is subject to a modest amount of seasonality 
historically  the company s results have been strongest during the quarters that end on december  and june the company attributes the relative weakness of the quarters that end on march  and september to  among other factors  winter weather and summer vacations 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue in future years 
for further discussion of this issue see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
insurance the company purchases comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur at parking facilities it owns  leases or manages 
the primary amount of such coverage is million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per facility 
in addition  the company purchases umbrella excess liability coverage 
the company s various liability insurance policies have deductibles of up to  that must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the company for costs and liabilities relating to covered claims 
as a result  the company is  in effect  self insured for all claims up to the deductible levels 
the company purchases a worker s compensation policy with a per claim deductible of  the company utilizes a third party administrator to process and pay filed worker s compensation claims 
the company also provides health insurance for many of its employees and purchases a stop loss policy with a deductible of  per claim 
because of the size of the operations covered and its claims experience  the company purchases liability insurance policies at prices that management believes represent a discount to the prices that would typically be charged to parking facility owners on a stand alone basis 
pursuant to its management contracts  the company charges its customers for insurance at rates it believes are competitive 
in each case  the company s clients have the option of purchasing their own policies  provided the company is named as an additional insured 
a reduction in the number of clients that purchase insurance through the company could have a material adverse effect on the operating earnings of the company 
in addition  a material increase in insurance costs due to an increase in the number of claims  higher claims costs or higher premiums paid by the company could have a material adverse effect on the operating earnings of the company 
in this regard  the company has experienced a substantial increase in the premiums it pays for insurance in each of the last three years and the company has experienced a significant increase in claims costs  including liability  group health  and worker s compensation 
these increased costs have adversely affected the company s profitability 
the company has been able page of 
table of contents to recover a portion of these increased costs through cost sharing programs  however  there can be no assurance the company will be able to fully recover or reduce these increased costs 
regulation the company s business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  and in some cases  municipal and state authorities directly regulate parking facilities 
the facilities in new york city are  for example  subject to extensive governmental restrictions concerning numbers of cars  pricing  structural integrity and certain prohibited practices 
many cities impose a tax or surcharge on parking services  which generally range from to of revenues collected 
several state and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car pooling and the use of mass transit or impose certain restrictions on automobile usage 
these types of laws have adversely affected the company s revenues and could continue to do so in the future 
an example was the restrictions imposed by the city of new york in the wake of the september terrorist attacks  which included street closures  traffic flow restrictions and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour 
although these restrictions have been eased  the city of new york is considering other actions  including higher tolls  increased taxes and vehicle occupancy requirements in certain circumstances  which could adversely impact the company 
the company is also affected by zoning and use restrictions and other laws and regulations that are common to any business that owns real estate 
the company is subject to numerous federal  state and local employment and labor laws and regulations  including title vii of the civil rights act of  as amended  the civil rights act of  the age discrimination in employment act of  the family medical leave act  wage and hour laws  and various state and local employment discrimination and human rights laws 
several cities in which the company has operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so called living wage ordinances which could adversely impact the company s profitability by requiring companies that contract with local governmental authorities and other employers to increase wages to levels substantially above the federal minimum wage 
in addition  the company is subject to provisions of the occupational safety and health act of  as amended osha and related regulations 
various other governmental regulations affect the company s operation of parking facilities  both directly and indirectly  including the americans with disabilities act ada 
under the ada  public accommodations  including many parking facilities  are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
for example  the ada generally requires garages to include handicapped spaces  headroom for wheelchair vans  and elevators that are operable by disabled persons 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of parking facilities  the company may be liable for any such costs 
although central parking is currently not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against it  there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against the company 
the cost of defending against claims of liability  or remediating a contaminated property  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company also is subject to various federal and state antitrust and consumer laws and regulations including the hart scott rodino antitrust improvements act of  as amended the hsr act  which requires notification filings and waiting periods in connection with certain mergers and acquisitions 
in connection with the company s merger with allright corporation allright in march  the antitrust division of the united states department of justice filed a complaint in us district court for the district of columbia seeking to enjoin the merger on antitrust grounds 
in addition  the company received notices from several states  including tennessee  texas  illinois and maryland  that the attorneys general of those states were reviewing the merger from an antitrust perspective 
several of these states also requested certain information relating to the merger and the operations of central parking and allright in the form of civil investigative demands 
central parking and allright entered into a settlement agreement with the antitrust division on march   under which the two companies agreed to divest a total of parking facilities in cities  representing approximately  parking spaces 
the settlement agreement also prohibited central parking and allright from  among other things  operating any of the divested properties for a period of two years following the divestiture of each facility 
the two year prohibition on operating the divested properties has expired 
none of the states that reviewed the transaction from an antitrust perspective became a party to the settlement agreement with the antitrust division and several of the states continued their investigation of the merger after the allright merger was consummated 
the completion of any future mergers or acquisitions by the company is subject to the filing requirements described above and possible review by the department of justice or the federal trade commission and various state attorneys general 
certain of the company s fee collection activities are subject to federal and state consumer protection or debt collection laws and regulations

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
accounting estimates are an integral part of the preparation of the financial statements and the financial reporting process and are based upon current judgments 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
certain accounting estimates are particularly sensitive because of their complexity and the possibility that future events affecting them may differ materially from the company s current judgments and estimates 
this listing of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment regarding accounting policy 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein for the year ended september   the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity impairment of long lived assets and goodwill as of september   the company s long lived assets were comprised primarily of million of property  equipment and leasehold improvements and million of contract and lease rights

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets

the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the determination and measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards require the significant use of judgment and estimates 
the determination of fair value of these assets utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and cost levels  assumed discount rates based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors  all of which involve the use of significant judgment and estimation 
the company recorded impairment losses of approximately million in property related losses and an additional million in discontinued operations during the year ended september  as a result of locations that were either under performing  terminated  disposed  or prematurely closed 
future events may indicate differences from management s judgments and estimates which could  in turn  result in increased impairment charges in the future 
future events that may result in increased impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which would impact discount rates  unfavorable economic conditions or other factors which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations  and changes in the cost structure of existing facilities 
for the fiscal year ended september   the company recorded million of impairment charges related to long lived assets and a million impairment charge related to goodwill 
the million goodwill impairment charge was reflected as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in fiscal year contract and lease rights as of september   the company had million of contract and lease rights 
the company capitalizes payments made to third parties which provide the company the right to manage or lease facilities 
lease rights and management contract rights which are purchased individually are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related agreements  which range from to years 
management contract rights acquired through acquisition of an entity are amortized as a group over the estimated term of the contracts  including anticipated renewals and terminations based on the company s historical page of 
table of contents experience typically years 
if the renewal rate of contracts within an acquired group is less than initially estimated  accelerated amortization or impairment may be necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts as of september   the company had million of trade receivables  including management accounts receivable and accounts receivable other

insurance the company purchases comprehensive liability insurance covering certain claims that occur at parking facilities it owns  leases or manages 
the primary amount of such coverage is million per occurrence and million in the aggregate per facility 
in addition  the company purchases umbrella excess liability coverage 
the company s various liability insurance policies have deductibles of up to  that must be met before the insurance companies are required to reimburse the company for costs incurred relating to covered claims

the company applies the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  in determining the timing and amount of expense recognition associated with claims against the company 
the expense recognition is based upon management s determination of an unfavorable outcome of a claim being deemed as probable and reasonably estimable  as defined in sfas no 
this determination requires the use of judgment in both the estimation of probability and the amount to be recognized as an expense 
beginning in  management engaged an actuary to assist in determining the liability reserves for customer injury and damage claims 
management utilizes historical experience with similar claims along with input from legal counsel in determining the likelihood and extent of an unfavorable outcome for certain general litigation

income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to account for income taxes

deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company has certain net operating loss carry forwards which expire between and the ability of the company to fully utilize these net operating losses to offset taxable income is limited due to changes in ownership of the companies which generated these losses 
these limitations have been considered in the determination of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was established for certain net operating loss carry forwards where their recoverability is deemed to be uncertain 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company will be required to adjust its deferred tax valuation allowances 
during the fiscal year  the company eliminated deferred tax valuation allowances on acquired operating loss carry forwards totaling  because management determined that the deferred tax assets from these operating loss carry forwards would be realized 
since these deferred tax assets were obtained from previous acquisitions where goodwill was recorded  the company reduced such goodwill by the amount of the elimination of the deferred tax valuation allowance

the closing of streets in the vicinity of the world trade center and other areas of new york city and the imposition of certain restrictions on traffic and other security measures in new york city and at the nation s airports also had a negative impact on the company s operations 
the company s operations are concentrated heavily in the downtown areas of major us cities and some are located near landmarks or other sites that have been mentioned as potential targets of terrorists 
in addition  the company manages the parking operations at approximately airports  including the airports in several major cities 
additional terrorist attacks or the imposition of additional security measures  particularly in new york  washington  dc or other major cities in which the company has a significant presence  or at airports  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the offer or sale of a substantial amount of central parking common stock by significant shareholders of the company could have an adverse impact on the market price of central parking common stock 
in february  the company filed a registration statement on form s covering  shares of the company s common stock held by certain shareholders of the company 
these shares were registered pursuant to registration rights previously granted to these shareholders 
these shareholders may sell all or a portion of the shares that were registered on any stock exchange  market or trading facility on which the shares are traded  or in private transactions 
other substantial shareholders of the company  including the chairman and chief executive officer of central parking  monroe carell  jr  the carell children s trust  and other family members and related entities the carell family  are permitted to sell significant amounts of the company s common stock under rule and other exemptions from registration under the federal securities laws 
in addition  the carell family has certain rights to register substantially all of the shares held by the family and related entities 
the offer or sale of substantial amounts of central parking common stock by these or other significant shareholders  particularly if such offers or sales occur simultaneously or relatively close in time  could have a significant negative impact on the stock s market price 
the company is dependent on the continued availability of capital to support its business 
the company has significant working capital requirements  including but not limited to  repair and maintenance obligations for many of its parking facilities 
the company is dependant on the cash generated from its operations and its credit facility to meet its working capital requirements 
during  the company refinanced its credit facility 
the credit facility contains covenants including those that require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  restrict further indebtedness and certain acquisition activity and limit the amount of dividends paid 
the primary ratios are a leverage ratio  senior leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
quarterly compliance is calculated using a four quarter rolling methodology and measured against certain targets 
the company s inability to meet debt covenants and debt service payments under the new credit facility would have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based upon its financing  investing and cash management activities 
the credit facility bears interest at libor plus a tier based margin dependent upon certain financial ratios 
there are separate tiers for the revolving loan and term loan 
the weighted average margin as of september  was page of 
table of contents basis points 
the amount outstanding under the company s credit facility was million with a weighted average interest rate of as of september  the term loan is required to be repaid in quarterly payments of  through march and quarterly payments of million from june through march the weighted average interest rate on the company s credit facility at september  was 
an increase decrease in libor of would result in an increase decrease of annual interest expense of million based on the company s outstanding credit facility balance of million at september  the company expects to pay both quarterly principle amortization and monthly interest payments out of operating cash flow 
the company s large number of leased and owned facilities increases the risk that the company may become unprofitable and that it may not be able to cover the fixed costs of its leased and owned facilities 
the company leased or owned  facilities as of september  although there is more potential for income from leased and owned facilities than from management contracts  they also carry more risk if there is a downturn in the economy  property performance or commercial real estate occupancy rates because a significant part of the costs to operate such facilities typically is fixed 
for example  in the case of leases  there are typically minimum lease payments that must be made regardless of the revenues or profitability of the facility 
in the case of owned facilities  there are the normal risks of ownership and costs of capital 
in addition  operating expenses for both leased and owned facilities are borne by central parking and are not passed through to the owner  as is the case with management contracts 
in the case of owned facilities and generally in the case of longer term leased facilities  the company also is responsible for property taxes and all maintenance and repair costs  including structural  mechanical and systems repairs 
performance of central parking s parking facilities depends  in part  on the company s ability to negotiate favorable contract terms and control operating expenses  economic conditions prevailing generally and in areas where parking facilities are located  the nature and extent of competitive parking facilities in the area  weather conditions and the real estate market 
an increase in government regulation or taxation could have a negative effect on the company s profitability 
the company s business is subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations  and in some cases  municipal and state authorities directly regulate parking facilities 
in addition  many cities impose a substantial tax or surcharge on parking services  which generally range from to 
the company s business is also affected by increases in property taxes 
several state and local laws have been passed in recent years which are designed to encourage car pooling or the use of mass transit or impose certain restrictions on automobile usage 
an example is the restrictions imposed by the city of new york in the wake of the september terrorist attacks  which included street closures and a requirement for passenger cars entering certain bridges and tunnels to have more than one occupant during the morning rush hour 
the company also is subject to federal  state and local employment and labor laws and regulations  and several cities in which the company has operations either have adopted or are considering the adoption of so called living wage ordinances 
the adoption of such laws and regulations  the imposition of additional parking taxes or surcharges and increases in property and other taxes could adversely impact the company s profitability 
the sureties for our performance bond program may increase rates further and require additional collateral to issue or renew performance bonds in support of certain contracts 
under substantially all of our contracts with municipalities and government entities and airports  we are required to provide a performance bond to support our obligations under the contract 
we are also required to provide performance bonds under certain leases and other contracts with non governmental entities 
due to our financial results in fiscal and the financial state of the surety bond industry  the sureties for our performance bond program have increased and rates have required us to collateralize a greater percentage of our performance bonds with letters of credit 
as a result  our working capital needs have increased and our borrowing capacity has decreased since letters of credit used by us to collateralize surety bonds reduces the availability of funds under our credit facility 
although the company believes its performance bond program is adequate for its present needs  we are unable to provide sufficient collateral in the future  our sureties may not issue performance bonds to support our obligations under certain contracts 
as is customary in the industry  a surety provider can refuse to provide a bond principal with new or renewal surety bonds 
if any existing or future surety provider refuses to provide us with surety bonds  there can be no assurance that we would be able to find alternate providers on acceptable terms  or at all 
our inability to provide surety bonds could result in the loss of existing contracts or future business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our net income could be adversely affected if reserves for future insurance losses are not adequate 
we provide liability  medical and worker s compensation insurance coverage under our various management contracts 
we are obligated to pay for each loss incurred up to the amount of a deductible specified in our insurance policies 
our financial statements reflect our anticipated costs based upon loss experience and guidance and evaluation we have received from third party insurance professionals  such as actuaries 
there can be no assurance  however  that the ultimate amount of such costs will not exceed the amount presently reserved  in which case we would need to increase reserves and pay additional expenses 
page of 
table of contents the operation of our business is dependent on key personnel 
our success is  and will continue to be  substantially dependent upon the continued services of our management team 
the loss of the services of one or more of the members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the results of operations 
although we have entered into employment agreements with  and historically have been successful in retaining the services of our senior management  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain these senior management people in the future 
in addition  our future growth depends on our ability to attract and retain skilled operating managers and employees 
we have foreign operations that may be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
central parking operates in the united kingdom  germany  mexico  the republic of ireland  chile  poland  greece  switzerland  colombia  peru  venezuela  canada and spain  and seeks to expand its business in these and other international locations 
for the year ended september   revenues from foreign operations represented of central parking s total revenues  excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses 
the company s united kingdom operations accounted for of total revenues  excluding reimbursement of management contract expense and excluding earnings from joint ventures 
central parking receives revenues and incurs expenses in various foreign currencies in connection with its foreign operations and  as a result  central parking is subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
central parking intends to continue to invest in foreign leased or owned parking facilities  either independently or through joint ventures  where appropriate  and may become increasingly exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
central parking believes it has currently limited exposure to foreign currency risk and does not have a foreign currency hedging program 
in connection with ownership or operation of parking facilities  we may be potentially liable for environmental problems 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances  and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in such property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against central parking or against its owned or operated parking facilities 
the cost of defending against claims of liability  or of remediating a contaminated property  could have a negative effect on central parking s business and financial results 
if we cannot maintain positive relationships with labor unions representing our employees  a work stoppage may adversely affect our business 
approximately  employees of central parking are represented by labor unions 
there can be no assurance that central parking will be able to renew existing labor union contracts on acceptable terms 
employees could exercise their rights under these labor union contracts  which could include a strike or walk out 
in such cases  there are no assurances that central parking would be able to staff sufficient employees for its short term needs 
any such labor strike or the inability of central parking to negotiate a satisfactory contract upon expiration of the current agreements could have a negative effect on central parking s business and financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rates the company s primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on variable rate borrowings 
as of september   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding under the credit facility  priced at libor plus a weighted average basis points 
the term loan of the credit facility is payable in quarterly installments of  through march and quarterly payments of million from june through march the company anticipates paying the scheduled quarterly payments from cash flows from operations 
the company is required under the credit facility to enter into and maintain interest rate protection agreements designed to limit the company s exposure to increases in interest rates 
on may   the company entered into two interest rate swap transactions for a total of million 
both transactions swapped the company s floating libor interest rates for fixed interest of until june  both of these derivative instruments have terms consistent with the terms of the credit facility and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the company had a million swap that matured on october  this swap hedged the credit facility that was paid in full in february of under the terms of that agreement  the company continued to pay the fixed interest through maturity 
because this swap was not associated with any debt subsequent to the credit facility being repaid in february  it page of 
table of contents did not qualify as a cash flow hedge subsequent to that date 
therefore  any changes in fair value of this swap subsequent to february  were recorded through the consolidated statement of operations 
the three interest rate cap agreements  which mature on march   also hedged the credit facility 
because the cap agreements are no longer associated with any existing debt  they are also considered ineffective 
therefore any change in fair value subsequent to february  has been reflected in the consolidated statement of operations 
the weighted average interest rate on the company s credit facility at september  was 
the rate includes all outstanding libor contracts and swap agreements at september  an increase decrease in libor of would result in an increase decrease of annual interest expense of million assuming the company s outstanding credit facility balance of million at september  remained the same 
in march  a limited liability company of which the company is the sole shareholder  purchased a parking structure for million and financed million with a five year note bearing interest at one month floating libor plus basis points 
to fix the interest rate  the company entered into a five year libor swap  yielding an effective interest cost of for the five year period 
the notional amount of the swap is reduced in conjunction with the principal payments on the related variable rate debt 
foreign currency exposure the company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is minimal 
as of september   the company has approximately gbp million usd million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in british pounds  eur million usd million denominated in euros  cad million usd million denominated in canadian dollars  and usd million denominated in various other foreign currencies 
the company also has eur million usd million of notes payable denominated in euros at september  these notes bear interest at a floating rate of as of september   and require monthly principal and interest payments through the company does not hold any hedging instruments related to foreign currency transactions 
the company monitors foreign currency positions and may enter into certain hedging instruments in the future should it determine that exposure to foreign exchange risk has increased 
based on the company s overall currency rate exposure as of september   management does not believe a near term change in currency rates  based on historical currency movements  would materially affect the company s financial statements
