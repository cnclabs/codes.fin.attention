item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following table sets forth certain information regarding the production volumes  oil and gas sales  average sales prices received and expenses for the periods indicated years ended december  net production oil mbbl gas mmcf gas equivalent mmcfe oil and gas sales in thousands oil gas total oil and gas sales average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf gas equivalent per mcfe expenses per mcfe production expenses and taxes general and administrative depreciation  depletion and amortization net wells drilled net wells at end of period recent developments our results of operations will be significantly impacted by acquisitions of oil and gas properties we have recently completed or announced and the related financings of the pending acquisitions 
on january   we completed the acquisition of mid continent gas assets from a wholly owned subsidiary of tulsa based oneok  inc for million 
based on internal reservoir engineering estimates  we believe the acquisition adds approximately bcfe of proved reserves 
the acquisition was funded with proceeds generated from the company s december issuance of million common shares at per share and million of senior notes 
on february   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire el paso corporation s anadarko basin assets in western oklahoma and the texas panhandle for million  which  by our internal estimates  will add approximately bcfe to our estimated proved reserves and approximately mmcfe to our daily production 
we expect to close the el paso acquisition in march on february   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire vintage petroleum  inc s assets in the bray field in southern oklahoma for million  which  by our internal estimates  will add approximately bcfe to our estimated proved reserves and approximately mmcfe to our daily production 
we expect to close the vintage acquisition in march 
table of contents on february   we announced a proposed private placement of million in aggregate principal amount of senior notes  a proposed public offering of  shares of common stock pursuant to our existing shelf registration statement and a proposed private placement of million of convertible preferred stock 
there is no assurance these proposed offerings will be completed or  if they are completed  that they will be completed for the amount contemplated 
results of operations general 
for the year ended december   chesapeake had net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million 
this compares to net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million during the year ended december   and net income of million  or per diluted common share  on total revenues of million during the year ended december  the net income includes  on a pre tax basis  million in risk management loss  a million impairment of our investment in seven seas petroleum  inc and a million loss on repurchases of debt 
the net income included  on a pre tax basis  million in risk management income  a million impairment of certain equity investments  a million gain on the sale of our canadian subsidiary  and a million cost for an unsecured standby credit facility associated with the acquisition of gothic energy corporation 
there was also a million extraordinary after tax loss on early extinguishment of debt 
net income in was significantly enhanced by the reversal of a deferred tax valuation allowance in the amount of million 
the reversal related to chesapeake s expected ability to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize net operating losses prior to their expiration 
oil and gas sales 
during  oil and gas sales were million versus million in and million in in  chesapeake produced bcfe at a weighted average price of per mcfe  compared to bcfe produced in at a weighted average price of per mcfe  and bcfe produced in at a weighted average price of per mcfe 
the decline in prices in resulted in a decline in revenue of million offset by million due to increased production  for a net decrease in revenues of million 
the increase in revenues over of million is due to increased prices million and increased production million 
the change in oil and gas prices has a significant impact on our oil and gas revenues and cash flows 
assuming the production levels  a change of 
per mcf would result in an increase decrease in revenues and cash flow of approximately million and million  respectively  and a change of per barrel would result in an increase decrease in revenues and cash flows of approximately million and million  respectively  without considering the effect of hedging activities 
for  we realized an average price per barrel of oil of  compared to in and in natural gas prices realized per mcf were  and in  and  respectively 
our hedging activities resulted in an increase in oil and gas revenues of million or per mcfe in  an increase of million or per mcfe in and a decrease of million or per mcfe in the following table shows our production by region for  and years ended december  mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mmcfe percent mid continent gulf coast canada permian basin williston basin and other total production 
table of contents natural gas production represented approximately of our total production volume on an equivalent basis in  compared to in and in the increase in production from through is due to the combination of organic production growth during the period as well as acquisitions completed in and effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized as an increase or decrease to the value of the hedged item until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the sfas definition of a cash flow hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income 
see hedging activities below and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
risk management income loss 
chesapeake recognized million of risk management loss in compared to million of risk management income in  and no such income loss in risk management income for consisted of losses of million related to changes in the fair value of derivatives not qualifying as cash flow hedges  million of reclassifications of gains on the settlement of such contracts and million associated with the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for cash flow hedge accounting 
it also included a gain of million related to changes in fair value of interest rate derivatives not qualifying for fair value hedge accounting  million of reclassifications of gains on the settlement of interest rate swaps to interest expense  and a million loss associated with the ineffective portion of our swaption 
risk management income for consisted of million related to changes in fair value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges less million of reclassifications related to the settlement of such contracts plus million associated with the ineffective portion of derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting 
pursuant to sfas  our cap swaps  counter swaps and basis protection swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
therefore  changes in fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity  together with any change in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness  are reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income loss 
amounts recorded in risk management income loss do not represent cash gains or losses 
rather  these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive either sfas cash flow or fair value hedge accounting treatment 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms 
oil and gas marketing sales 
chesapeake realized million in oil and gas marketing sales for third parties in  with corresponding oil and gas marketing expenses of million  for a net margin of million 
this compares to sales of million and million  expenses of million and million  and margins of million and million in and  respectively 
in and  chesapeake realized an increase in volumes related to oil and gas marketing sales  which was partially offset by a decrease in oil and gas prices for both years 

table of contents production expenses 
production expenses  which include lifting costs and ad valorem taxes  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
on a unit of production basis  production expenses were per mcfe in compared to and per mcfe in and  respectively 
the increase in costs on a per unit basis in and is due primarily to increased field service costs and higher production costs associated with properties acquired during these years 
we expect that production expenses per mcfe in will range from to 
production taxes 
production taxes were million in compared to million in and million in on a unit of production basis  production taxes were  and per mcfe in  and  respectively 
the decrease in of million was due to a decrease in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas 
the increase in of million was due to an increase in production volumes and  to a lesser extent  an increase in the average wellhead prices received for natural gas 
in general  production taxes are calculated using value based formulas that produce higher per unit costs when oil and gas prices are higher 
we expect production taxes per mcfe to range from to in based on our assumption that oil and natural gas wellhead prices will range from to per mcfe 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses  which are net of internal payroll and non payroll costs capitalized in our oil and gas properties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were million in  million in and million in the increase in and is the result of the company s growth related to the various acquisitions which occurred in and we anticipate that general and administrative expenses for will be between and per mcfe  which is approximately the same level as chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
we capitalized million  million and million of internal costs in  and  respectively  directly related to our oil and gas exploration and development efforts 
during  we reversed approximately million of our accrued liability previously established in connection with the west panhandle field cessation cases as a reduction to general and administrative expenses 
in connection with a legal proceeding brought against us by certain royalty owners  we determined that a portion of the marketing fee we had charged the royalty owners should be refunded 
in late  we deposited with the court million to be held in an interest bearing account for distribution to affected royalty owners which resulted in a charge to general and administrative expenses 
a description of pending royalty owner litigation is included below under liquidity and capital resources contingencies 
oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the average dd a rate per mcfe  which is a function of capitalized costs  future development costs  and the related underlying reserves in the periods presented  was all domestic  in us and in canada  and in us and in canada in  and  respectively 
we expect the dd a rate to be between and per mcfe 
the increase in the average rate from to is primarily the result of higher drilling costs and higher costs associated with acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization of other assets 
depreciation and amortization of other assets was million in  compared to million in and million in the increases in and were primarily the result of higher depreciation costs on fixed assets related to capital expenditures made in both years 
other property and equipment costs are depreciated on a straight line basis 
buildings are depreciated over years  drilling rigs are depreciated over years and all other property and equipment are depreciated over 
table of contents the estimated useful lives of the assets  which range from three to seven years 
to the extent the drilling rigs are used to drill our wells  a substantial portion of the depreciation is capitalized in oil and gas properties as exploration or development costs 
we expect depreciation and amortization of other assets to be between and per mcfe 
interest and other income 
interest and other income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in was the result of income recognized on our investments in seven seas and ram and interest earned on overnight investments 
the decrease in was the result of a decrease in miscellaneous non oil and gas income offset by an increase in interest income 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in is due to a million increase in average long term borrowings in compared to the increase in is due to a million increase in average long term borrowings in compared to  partially offset by a decrease in the overall average interest rate 
in addition to the interest expense reported  we capitalized million of interest during  compared to million capitalized in  and million capitalized in on significant investments in unproved properties that were not being currently depreciated  depleted or amortized and on which exploration activities were in progress 
interest is capitalized using the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings 
we expect interest expense to be between and per mcfe 
loss on investments in seven seas 
in july  chesapeake purchased million principal amount of senior secured notes due issued by seven seas petroleum  inc and detachable seven year warrants to purchase approximately million shares of seven seas common stock at an exercise price of approximately per share 
the senior secured notes held by us  and the million of notes acquired by other parties  are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the assets owned by seven seas 
in december  seven seas announced that it was in default under the senior secured notes 
on december   we accelerated all amounts owing to us 
on december   seven seas announced that it had entered into an agreement with an independent third party to sell its interests in the guaduas oil field in colombia for million 
later in december  holders of its senior unsecured notes filed an involuntary chapter petition in bankruptcy against seven seas 
in january  the case was converted to a chapter proceeding and a bankruptcy trustee was appointed 
the asset sale closed on february  seven seas has reported that the only material assets remaining are its rights associated with the deep dindal association contract and certain colombian tax assets 
seven seas has also said it will not have sufficient cash to conduct additional operations 
in the third quarter of  chesapeake recorded an impairment of million representing of the cost allocated to our seven seas common stock warrants 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional impairment of million to reduce our net investment in the senior secured notes  including accrued interest  to million  representing chesapeake s anticipated share of the net proceeds from the liquidation of seven seas assets 
loss on repurchases of debt 
during  we purchased and subsequently retired million of our senior notes due for total consideration of million  including accrued interest of million and million of redemption premium partially offset by a million gain from interest rate hedging activities associated with the retired debt 
impairments of investments in securities 
during we recorded impairments to two equity investments of million 
the majority of this impairment was related to our investment in ram energy  inc in march  we issued million shares of chesapeake common stock in exchange for of ram s outstanding common stock 
our shares were valued at each  or million in total 
during  we recorded our equity in ram s net losses  which had the effect of reducing our carrying value in these securities 
table of contents to million 
in december  we sold the ram shares for minimal consideration 
in addition  we reduced the carrying value of our million investment in an internet based oil and gas business by million to million 
gain on sale of canadian subsidiary 
in october  we sold our canadian subsidiary  which had oil and gas operations primarily in northeast british columbia  for approximately million 
under full cost accounting  our investment in these canadian oil and gas properties was treated as a separate cost center for accounting purposes 
as a result of the sale of this cost center  any gain or loss on the disposition was required to be recognized in current earnings 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a gain on sale of our canadian subsidiary of million 
gothic standby credit facility costs 
during  we obtained a standby commitment for a million credit facility  consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility which  if needed  would have replaced our then existing revolving credit facility 
the term loan was available to provide funds to repurchase any of gothic production corporation s senior secured notes tendered following the closing of the gothic acquisition in january pursuant to a change of control offer to purchase 
in february  we purchased million of notes tendered for of such amount 
we did not use the standby credit facility and the commitment terminated on february  chesapeake incurred million of costs for the standby facility  which were recognized in the first quarter of extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
during  we purchased or redeemed million principal amount of our senior notes  million principal amount of the senior secured notes of gothic production corporation  a chesapeake subsidiary  and all million principal amount of our senior notes 
these redemptions were done as a part of a refinancing of approximately of our senior note debt and of our total long term debt outstanding 
even though we purchase our outstanding senior notes from time to time  the refinancing of the majority of our senior debt was an unusual non recurring event and as such we have reported it as an extraordinary item in accordance with apb see recently issued accounting standards within this item the purchase and redemption of these notes included payment of aggregate make whole and redemption premiums of million and the write off of unamortized debt costs and debt issue premiums 
these costs associated with early extinguishment of debt are reflected as a million after tax extraordinary loss in provision benefit for income taxes 
chesapeake recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to income tax expense of million in and income tax benefit of million in all income tax expense for is related to our domestic operations 
income tax expense for is comprised of million related to our domestic operations  million related to our canadian operations and million related to the sale of our canadian subsidiary 
the income tax benefit in was comprised of million of income tax expense related to our canadian operations and the reversal of a million deferred tax valuation allowance which was established in prior years 
the valuation allowance had been established due to uncertainty surrounding our ability to utilize extensive regular tax nols prior to their expiration 
based upon our results of operations as of december   the improved outlook for the natural gas industry and our projected results of future operations  we believed it was more likely than not that chesapeake would be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to utilize our existing nols prior to their expiration 
consequently  we determined that a valuation allowance was no longer required at december  as of december   we determined that it was more likely than not that million of the deferred tax assets related to louisiana net operating losses will not be realized and we recorded a valuation allowance equal to such amounts 
our expectations remain unchanged as of december  cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities cash flows from operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities exclusive of changes in working capital was million in  compared to million in and million in 
table of contents the million decrease from to was primarily due to decreased oil and gas revenues resulting from lower prices partially offset by higher volumes and the increase in over was due to significantly higher gas prices and higher volumes of both oil and gas 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash used in investing activities increased to million in  compared to million in and million in during  chesapeake invested cash of million for exploration and development drilling and million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties  and we received million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties 
in  we invested million in securities of other companies 
we also invested million in drilling rig equipment  million in our oklahoma city office complex and million on upgrading various other properties and equipment 
during  chesapeake invested cash of million for exploration and development drilling and million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties  and we received million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties and million for the sale of our canadian subsidiary 
in  we invested million in securities of other companies  including million in notes and warrants of seven seas petroleum inc  million in notes of ram energy  inc and million in other equity securities 
we also invested million in drilling rig equipment  million in our oklahoma city office complex and million on upgrading various other properties and equipment 
during  chesapeake invested million for exploration and development drilling  invested million for the acquisition of oil and gas properties  and received million related to divestitures of oil and gas properties 
we invested million in connection with our acquisition of gothic energy corporation  including the purchase of gothic notes and acquisition related costs 
we also invested million in advanced drilling technologies  llc additionally in  we invested million in our oklahoma city office complex 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in and million used in during  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of million 
we incurred million of deferred charges related to the amendment of our bank credit facility 
in  we received million from the issuance of our million senior notes in august and november and million from the issuance of our million senior notes in december 
we incurred million of costs related to the issuance of these notes 
in december  we issued million in common stock and received million of net proceeds 
we received million from the exercise of employee and director stock options 
during  we purchased and subsequently retired million of our senior notes for million including redemption premium of million 
preferred stock dividends of million and common stock dividends of million were paid in during  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of million 
we incurred million of deferred charges related to our credit facility 
in  we received million from the issuance of our million senior notes in april and million from the issuance of our million senior notes in november 
we used million to purchase or redeem various chesapeake and gothic senior notes 
we incurred million of costs related to the issuance of these notes 
in november  we issued million in preferred stock and received million of net proceeds 
we received million from the exercise of employee and director stock options 
we paid million for make whole provisions in the fourth quarter related to the exchange of our common stock for ram energy  inc common stock which occurred in march preferred stock dividends of million were paid in 
table of contents during  we borrowed million under our bank credit facility and made repayments under this facility of million 
also in  we paid million in connection with exchanges of our preferred stock for our common stock and paid cash dividends of million on our preferred stock 
in connection with our purchase of gothic notes in  we received million cash from the sellers of gothic notes pursuant to make whole provisions included in the purchase agreements 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity chesapeake had working capital of million at december   of which million was cash 
another source of liquidity is our million revolving bank credit facility with a committed borrowing base of million which matures in june at february  we had million of indebtedness under the bank credit facility 
we expect we will have no bank indebtedness at the conclusion of our proposed securities offerings  assuming they are all successfully closed 
if the proposed offerings do not close as planned  however  we may need to use all or substantially all of our available bank borrowings to fund our pending acquisitions  which could substantially limit our liquidity 
we believe we will have adequate resources  including budgeted operating cash flows  working capital and proceeds from our revolving bank credit facility  to fund our capital expenditure budget for drilling  land and seismic activities during  which is currently estimated to be between and million 
however  higher drilling and field operating costs  unfavorable drilling results or other factors could cause us to reduce our drilling program  which is largely discretionary 
based on our current cash flow assumptions  we expect operating cash flow to be between million and million 
any operating cash flow not needed to fund our drilling program will be available for acquisitions  debt repayment or other general corporate purposes in a significant portion of our liquidity at december  is concentrated in cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of investments in debt instruments and accounts receivables 
our accounts receivable are primarily from purchasers of oil and natural gas products and exploration and production companies which own interests in properties we operate 
the industry concentration has the potential to impact our overall exposure to credit risk  either positively or negatively  in that our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic  industry or other conditions 
we generally require letters of credit for receivables from customers which are judged to have sub standard credit  unless the credit risk can otherwise be mitigated 
cash and cash equivalents are deposited with major banks or institutions with high credit ratings 
our liquidity is not dependent on the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as the securitization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
we have not relied on off balance sheet financing arrangements in the past and we do not intend to rely on such arrangements in the future as a source of liquidity 
we are not a commercial paper issuer 
contractual obligations we completed an acquisition of mid continent gas assets from a wholly owned subsidiary of tulsa based oneok  inc in january we paid million in cash for these assets  million of which was paid in we have a million revolving bank credit facility with a committed borrowing base of million which matures in june as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility and utilized million of the facility for various letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by certain producing oil and gas properties and bear interest at either the reference rate of union bank of california  na  or london interbank offered rate libor  at our option  plus a margin that varies according 
table of contents to total facility usage 
the collateral value and borrowing base are redetermined periodically 
the unused portion of the facility is subject to an annual commitment fee of 
interest is payable quarterly 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants and restrictive provisions which limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell properties  pay dividends  purchase or redeem our capital stock  make investments or loans or purchase certain of our senior notes  create liens  and make acquisitions 
the credit facility agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio as defined of at least to and a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of at least to at december   our current ratio was to and our fixed charge coverage ratio was to if we should fail to perform our obligations under these and other covenants  the revolving credit commitment could be terminated and any outstanding borrowings under the facility could be declared immediately due and payable 
such acceleration  if involving a principal amount of million or more  would constitute an event of default under our senior note indentures  which could in turn result in the acceleration of our senior note indebtedness 
the credit facility agreement also has cross default provisions that apply to other indebtedness we may have with an outstanding principal amount in excess of million 
as of december   senior notes represented approximately billion of our long term debt and consisted of the following in thousands senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due there are no scheduled principal payments required on any of the senior notes until march  when million is due 
debt ratings for the senior notes are b by moody s investor service  b by standard poor s ratings services and bb by fitch ratings as of december  debt ratings for our secured bank credit facility are ba by moody s investor service  bb by standard poor s ratings services and bb by fitch ratings 
our senior notes are unsecured senior obligations of chesapeake and rank equally with all of our other unsecured indebtedness 
all of our wholly owned subsidiaries except chesapeake energy marketing  inc guarantee the notes 
the indentures permit us to redeem the senior notes at any time at specified make whole or redemption prices 
the indentures for the   and senior notes contain covenants limiting our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem  repurchase or retire our capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  make investments and other restricted payments  create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our restricted subsidiaries  incur liens  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the debt incurrence covenants do not affect our ability to borrow under or expand our secured credit facility 
as of december   we estimate that secured commercial bank indebtedness of approximately million could have been incurred under the most restrictive indenture covenant 
the indenture covenants do not apply to chesapeake energy marketing  inc  which is our only unrestricted subsidiary 

table of contents the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations standby letters of credit other long term obligations total contractual obligations some of our commodity price and financial risk management arrangements require us to deliver cash collateral or other assurances of performance to the counterparties in the event that our payment obligations with respect to our commodity price and financial risk management transactions exceed certain levels 
at december   we were required to post million collateral 
future collateral requirements are uncertain and will depend on arrangements with our counterparties  highly volatile natural gas and oil prices  and fluctuations in interest rates 
investing and financing transactions on june   we acquired canaan energy corporation in a cash merger through a chesapeake subsidiary  adding approximately bcfe to our proved reserves 
under the agreement  all outstanding common shares of canaan  other than the canaan shares already owned by chesapeake  were purchased at per share in cash  and the outstanding options to acquire canaan common stock were converted into the right to receive  for each share of canaan common stock to be received upon exercise  the merger consideration less the per share exercise price and withholding taxes 
the aggregate net cash consideration for the merger was million  including the retirement of canaan s outstanding indebtedness of approximately million 
during the third quarter of  we completed four separate acquisitions of mid continent oil and gas properties for an aggregate cash purchase price of million 
we estimate these acquisitions added approximately bcfe of proved reserves 
the acquisitions included privately held focus energy  inc and its related partnerships  the mid continent assets of publicly traded encana corporation  the mid continent assets of og e energy corp 
and the anadarko basin assets of the williams companies  inc during  we purchased and subsequently retired million of our senior notes due for total consideration of million  including accrued interest of million and million of redemption premium partially offset by a million gain from interest rate hedging activities associated with the retired debt 
in july  we filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission that permits us  over time  to sell up to million of debt securities or common stock  in any combination 
net proceeds  terms and pricing of the offerings of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings 
we offered and sold million of common stock in december  pursuant to a supplement to the registration statement 
in august  we closed a private offering of million principal amount of senior notes due  all of which were exchanged in october for substantially identical notes registered under the securities act of the net proceeds from this issuance of million were used to fund the acquisitions we completed in july and august  and to purchase outstanding senior notes 
on november   
table of contents chesapeake closed a private offering of an additional million principal amount of senior notes due the net proceeds from the offering of million were used to purchase outstanding senior notes and to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving bank credit facility 
the senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our other outstanding senior notes and are subject to covenants substantially similar to those contained in the indenture for our senior notes 
on september   our board of directors declared a per share dividend on the company s common stock which was paid in october chesapeake has not paid a dividend on its common stock since the annualized cost of the common stock dividend will be about million 
in december  we closed a private offering of million principal amount of senior notes due the net proceeds from this issuance of million were used to fund a portion of the acquisition of oil and gas properties from oneok  inc in january the senior notes are guaranteed by the same subsidiaries that guarantee our other outstanding senior notes and are subject to covenants substantially similar to those contained in the indentures for our and senior notes 
in december  we issued  shares of chesapeake common stock at per share 
the net proceeds from the offering of million were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of oil and gas properties from oneok  inc in january these shares were issued under the shelf registration statement filed in july contingencies recently  royalty owners have commenced litigation against a number of oil and gas producers claiming that amounts paid for production attributable to the royalty owners interest violated the terms of applicable leases and state law  that deductions from the proceeds of oil and gas production were unauthorized under the leases  and that amounts received by upstream sellers should be used to compute the amounts paid to the royalty owners 
typically this litigation has taken the form of class action suits 
there are presently four such suits filed against chesapeake  two in texas and two in oklahoma 
no class has been certified in any of them 
in one of the oklahoma cases  we determined that a portion of the marketing fee we had charged royalty owners should be refunded 
in late  we deposited with the court the aggregate amount of the fees we estimated should be refunded  million  in an interest bearing account for distribution to affected royalty owners 
this was charged to general and administrative expenses 
we do not believe any other claims made by royalty owners in the cases pending against us are valid 
even if the claims were upheld  we believe any damages awarded would not be material 
this is a developing area of the law  however  and as new cases are decided  our potential liability relating to the marketing of oil and gas may increase or decrease 
we will continue to monitor court decisions to ensure that our operations and practices minimize any exposure and to recognize any charges that may be appropriate when we can reasonably estimate a liability 
application of critical accounting policies readers of this document and users of the information contained in it should be aware of how certain events may impact our financial results based on the accounting policies in place 
the four policies we consider to be the most significant are discussed below 
the company s management has discussed each critical accounting policy with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that changes as our business changes and as accounting rules are developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules and the use of judgment to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
hedging 
from time to time  chesapeake uses commodity price and financial risk management instruments to hedge our exposure to price fluctuations in oil and natural gas and interest rates 
recognized gains 
table of contents and losses on hedge contracts are reported as a component of the related transaction 
results of oil and gas hedging transactions are reflected in oil and gas sales  and results of interest rate hedging transactions are reflected in interest expense 
the changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not qualifying for designation as cash flow or fair value hedges that occur prior to maturity are initially reported in the consolidated statement of operations as risk management income loss 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption are ultimately reversed within the same caption and included in oil and gas sales or interest expense  as applicable  over the respective contract terms 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the consolidated statement of operations 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized as an increase or decrease to the value of the hedged item until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
any change in the fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
changes in fair value of contracts that do not meet the sfas definition of a cash flow or fair value hedge are also recognized in earnings through risk management income 
see hedging activities below and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
one of the primary factors that can have an impact on our results of operations is the method used to value our derivatives 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties and subsequently evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
another factor that can impact our results of operations each period is our ability to estimate the level of correlation between future changes in the fair value of the hedge instruments and the transactions being hedged  both at the inception and on an ongoing basis 
this correlation is complicated since energy commodity prices  the primary risk we hedge  have quality and location differences that can be difficult to hedge effectively 
the factors underlying our estimates of fair value and our assessment of correlation of our hedging derivatives are impacted by actual results and changes in conditions that affect these factors  many of which are beyond our control 
due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  the company s financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and  the net market value of our derivatives was a liability of million and an asset of million  respectively 
risk management income loss for the years ended december  and was a loss of million and a gain of million  respectively 
with respect to our derivatives held as of december   an increase or decrease in natural gas prices of 
per mmbtu would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 
an increase or decrease in crude oil prices of per barrel would increase or decrease the estimated fair value of our derivatives by approximately million 

table of contents oil and gas properties 
chesapeake follows the full cost method of accounting under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of oil and gas properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the aggregated full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result  our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rate 
capitalized costs are amortized on a composite unit of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves 
as of december   approximately of our present value discounted at of estimated future net revenues of proved reserves was evaluated by independent petroleum engineers  with the balance evaluated by our internal reservoir engineers 
in addition  our internal engineers reevaluate our reserves on a quarterly basis 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense is based on the amount of estimated reserves 
if we maintain the same level of production year over year  the depreciation  depletion and amortization expense will be significantly different if our estimate of remaining reserves changes significantly 
proceeds from the sale of properties are accounted for as reductions of capitalized costs unless such sales involve a significant change in the relationship between costs and the value of proved reserves or the underlying value of unproved properties  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the costs of unproved properties are excluded from amortization until the properties are evaluated 
we review all of our unevaluated properties quarterly to determine whether or not and to what extent proved reserves have been assigned to the properties  and otherwise if impairment has occurred 
unevaluated properties are grouped by major producing area where individual property costs are not significant and are assessed individually when individual costs are significant 
we review the carrying value of our oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the securities and exchange commission on a quarterly basis 
this quarterly review is referred to as a ceiling test 
under the ceiling test  capitalized costs  less accumulated amortization and related deferred income taxes  may not exceed an amount equal to the sum of the present value of estimated future net revenues less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves  less any related income tax effects 
the two primary factors impacting this test are reserve levels and current prices  and their associated impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
revisions to estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and or a decline in prices can have a material impact on the present value of estimated future net revenues 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various properties increases the likelihood of significant changes in these estimates 
in addition  the prices of natural gas and oil are volatile and change from period to period 
price increases directly impact the estimated revenues from our properties and the associated present value of future net revenues 
such changes also impact the economic life of our properties and thereby affect the quantity of reserves that can be assigned to a property 
the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the impact of revisions to reserve estimates can have a significant impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
from january  to december   we recorded ceiling test impairments of approximately billion to our oil and gas 
table of contents properties largely as a result of lower commodity prices 
in addition  our oil and gas depreciation  depletion and amortization rates have fluctuated between per mcfe in to in reflecting the impact of prices during these periods 
as of december   a decrease in natural gas prices of per mcf and a decrease in oil prices of per barrel would reduce the company s estimated proved reserves of  bcfe by bcfe and bcfe  respectively  and would also reduce the company s present value of estimated future net revenues by approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate the federal and state income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which chesapeake operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as derivative instruments  depreciation  depletion and amortization  and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
if we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent chesapeake establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provisions in the consolidated statement of operations 
under sfas  accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists a the more positive evidence is necessary and b the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carryforward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
beginning in and continuing throughout  we recorded various asset write downs related to the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
the write downs and significant tax net operating loss carryforwards caused primarily by expensing intangible drilling costs for tax purposes resulted in a net deferred tax asset 
from june through september  management believed that it was more likely than not that the company would continue generating future tax net operating losses for the foreseeable future and consequently recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
in the fourth quarter of  we eliminated our existing valuation allowance resulting in the recognition of a million income tax benefit 
based upon results of operations for the year ended december  and anticipated improvement in chesapeake s outlook for sustained profitability  we believed that it was more likely than not that we would generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits associated with our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration 
aside from a small valuation allowance related to net operating losses generated in louisiana  we continue to believe that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the tax benefits associated with our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration 
if a natural gas and oil prices were to decrease significantly below present levels and if such decreases were considered other than temporary  b exploration  drilling and operating costs were to increase significantly beyond current levels  or c we were confronted with any other significantly negative evidence pertaining to our ability to realize our nol carryforwards prior to their expiration  we may be required to provide a valuation 
table of contents allowance against our deferred tax asset 
as of december  we have a deferred tax asset of million  of which only million had an associated valuation allowance 
accounting for business combinations 
beginning in  we have completed several business combinations 
in the future  we may continue to grow our business through similar transactions 
prior to the issuance of sfas  accounting for business combinations  in  we applied the guidance provided by accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 and its interpretations  as well as various other authoritative literature and interpretations that address issues encountered in accounting for business combinations 
we have accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method  which is the only method permitted under sfas the accounting for business combinations is complicated and involves the use of significant judgment 
under the purchase method of accounting  a business combination is accounted for at a purchase price based upon the fair value of the consideration given  whether in the form of cash  assets  stock or the assumption of liabilities 
the assets and liabilities acquired are measured at their fair values  and the purchase price is allocated to the assets and liabilities based upon these fair values 
the excess of the cost of an acquired entity  if any  over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed over the cost of an acquired entity  if any  is allocated as a pro rata reduction of the amounts that otherwise would have been assigned to certain of the acquired assets 
determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired involves the use of judgment  since some of the assets and liabilities acquired do not have fair values that are readily determinable 
different techniques may be used to determine fair values  including market prices  where available  appraisals  comparisons to transactions for similar assets and liabilities and present value of estimated future cash flows  among others 
since these estimates involve the use of significant judgment  they can change as new information becomes available 
each of the business combinations completed during the past five years were of small to medium sized exploration and production companies with oil and gas interests primarily in the mid continent 
we believe that the consideration we have paid to acquire these companies has represented the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired at the time of acquisition 
consequently  we have not recognized any goodwill from any of our business combinations  nor do we expect to recognize any goodwill from similar business combinations that we may complete in the future 
hedging activities oil and gas hedging our results of operations and operating cash flows are impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
to mitigate a portion of the exposure to adverse market changes  we have entered into various derivative instruments 
as of december   our oil and gas derivative instruments were comprised of swaps  cap swaps and basis protection swaps 
these instruments allow us to predict with greater certainty the oil and gas prices to be received for our hedged production 
although derivatives often fail to achieve effectiveness for accounting purposes  our derivative instruments continue to be highly effective in achieving the risk management objectives for which they were intended 
for swap instruments  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price  as defined in each instrument  to the counterparty 
the fixed price payment and the floating price payment are netted  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
for cap swaps  we receive a fixed price for the hedged commodity and pay a floating market price 
the fixed price received by chesapeake includes a premium in exchange for a cap limiting the counterparty s exposure 

table of contents basis protection swaps are arrangements that guarantee a price differential of oil and gas from a specified delivery point 
chesapeake receives a payment from the counterparty if the price differential is greater than the stated terms of the contract and pays the counterparty if the price differential is less than the stated terms of the contract 
from time to time  we close certain swap and cap swap transactions designed to hedge a portion of our oil and natural gas production by entering into a counter swap instrument 
under the counter swap we receive a floating price for the hedged commodity and pay a fixed price to the counterparty 
to the extent the counter swap  which does not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas  is designed to lock the value of an existing sfas cash flow hedge  the net value of the swap and the counter swap is frozen and shown as a derivative receivable or payable in the consolidated balance sheets 
at the same time  the original swap is designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under sfas the net receivable or payable is frozen until the related month of production and is then recognized as an increase or decrease to revenues 
changes in fair value occurring after the original swap has been designated as a non qualifying cash flow hedge under sfas are included in results of operations 
to the extent the counter swap is designed to lock the value of a non qualifying cash flow hedge under sfas  the value of the counter swap is shown as a derivative asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheet and referred to below as a fixed price counter swap 
any changes in the fair value of the counter swap are included in results of operations 
pursuant to sfas  our cap swaps  counter swaps and basis protection swaps do not qualify for designation as cash flow hedges 
therefore  changes in the fair value of these instruments that occur prior to their maturity  together with any changes in fair value of cash flow hedges resulting from ineffectiveness  are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as risk management income loss 
amounts recorded in risk management income loss do not represent cash gains or losses 
rather  these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts or portions of contracts that are not entitled to receive sfas cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
all amounts initially recorded in this caption related to commodity derivatives are ultimately reversed within this same caption and included in oil and gas sales over the respective contract terms

results from interest rate hedging transactions are reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the derivative agreement 
in march  we entered into an interest rate swap to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the terms of this swap agreement are as follows term notional amount fixed rate floating rate march march us six month libor in arrears plus basis points at the inception of the interest rate swap agreement  a portion of the interest rate swap was to convert million of our senior notes from fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
under sfas  a hedge of interest rate risk in a recognized fixed rate liability can be designated as a fair value hedge 
the mark to market value of the swap is therefore recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability with a corresponding increase or decrease in the carrying value of the debt

we received approximately million from the counterparty at the time we entered into this agreement 
the terms of the swaption are as follows term notional amount fixed rate floating rate march march us six month libor plus basis points under the terms of the swaption agreement  the counterparty will have the option to initiate an interest rate swap on march  pursuant to the terms shown above 
if the counterparty chooses to initiate the interest rate swap  the payments under the swap will coincide with the semi annual interest payments on our senior notes which are paid on september and march of each year 
on each payment date  if the fixed rate exceeds the floating rate  we will pay the counterparty and if the floating rate exceeds the fixed rate  the counterparty will pay us accordingly 
if the counterparty does not choose to initiate the interest rate swap  the swaption agreement will expire and no future obligations will exist for either party 
under sfas  a fair value hedge relationship exists between the embedded call option in the senior notes and the swaption agreement 
accordingly  the mark to market value of the swaption is recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as an asset or liability with a corresponding increase or decrease to the debt s carrying value 
any change in the fair value of the swaption resulting from ineffectiveness is recorded currently in the consolidated statements of operations as risk management income loss 
we have recorded a decrease in the carrying value of the debt of million during related to the swaption as of december  of this amount  million represents a decline in the fair value of the swaption  offset by a loss of million from estimated ineffectiveness of the swaption as determined under sfas see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for the adjustments made to the carrying value of the debt at december  results of the interest rate swap  if initiated  will be reflected as adjustments to interest expense in the corresponding months covered by the swaption agreement

sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long term assets mainly plugging and abandonment costs for depleted wells in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled 
accordingly  we adopted this standard in the first quarter of we expect the effect on our financial condition and results of operations at adoption will include an increase in liabilities of approximately million and a cumulative effect for the change in accounting principle as a charge against earnings of approximately million net of income taxes

fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december  chesapeake is not a guarantor under any significant guarantees and thus this interpretation is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations
